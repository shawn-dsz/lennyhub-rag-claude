I think that's a terrible trap that we should all try to avoid as we navigate our career paths and find the thing that's most optimal for us. Which is usually a mix of career success, but also meaningfulness and alignment in the work that we're doing with our values.\n\nLenny (00:00:36):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard [inaudible 00:00:42] experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Ada Chen Rekhi. Ada is an executive coach and also the co-founder of a product called Notejoy. In her coaching practice, she focuses on helping founders scale themselves. Before starting her company, she was senior vice president of marketing at SurveyMonkey. Before that, she started a contact management startup that was acquired by LinkedIn where she ended up leading LinkedIn's marketing efforts for their growth team. Two fun facts about Ada. One, she started her current company with her husband, which we chat about whether that's a good idea or not. Also, her brother is Andrew Chen of a16z fame. In our conversation, it explains how to make better decisions with a framework she calls Curiosity Loops.\n\n(00:01:21):\nWe do a live exercise around my own personal values. She shares a bunch of advice on how to intentionally and practically build your early career path. How to thrive as a woman in Silicon Valley, when to get a coach and what you can do on your own without one and a ton more. Enjoy this episode with Ada Chen Rekhi after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:40):\nThis episode is brought to you by Sprig. Next generation product teams like, Robinhood, Notion and Loom rely on Sprig to uncover blind spots in their product development process. Sprig let's product teams collect user insights fast, allowing you to better understand why users take certain actions and how they feel about the experience. One of the things I love most about Sprig is that they're all about getting product teams the specific insights they need in the timeframe that they need it.\n\n(00:02:07):\nAs of today's, Sprig is making that even easier with the new and improved templates library. On this podcast, you've heard a lot about how useful templates are for companies as they grow. Sprig partnered with some of the top product teams and product thinkers to build proven playbooks, specifically to solve the biggest challenges facing product teams today from how to optimize an existing feature to improving a conversion flow to troubleshooting drop off. Sprig helps you build better products. Sprig now has a library of more than 85 templates that you can use to get started collecting user insights quickly right in your app. I especially love that Sprig builds templates specifically for product teams, and I was really excited when they ask me to create a template around product sense.\n\n(00:02:47):\nOne of the questions they get most is how to develop your product sense. So I decided to build a playbook along with Sprig on how to do that based on my experience at Airbnb and from what I've learned interviewing top product folks like, Jules Walter who wrote a whole guest post on how to build your product sense. Explore my product sense playbook and the entire Sprig templates library and build better products faster. Check it out today at sprig.com/templates. That's S-P-R-I-G.com/templates. Ada, welcome to the podcast.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:03:20):\nThanks. I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:03:22):\nSo I've heard such great things about you from a lot of people, including a bunch of guests that have been on the podcast. And you also have this really great event diagram of maybe an ideal guest for the podcast. You've done growth. You've done products. You've started a company. You're also an executive coach to founders. So there's a variety of topics I'm excited to begin too. So thanks again for being here.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:03:22):\nYeah, I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:03:45):\nAn interesting thing that I'll start with is that when we were chatting about what to focus on in our conversation, where you're emailing about this, and you did something that I thought was really interesting. You ran something called a Curiosity Loop where you pinged a bunch of your friends and asked them for input in this really structured way. So I thought I'd start there. Could you just share what this process is, so that we can learn how to maybe do it ourselves, this idea of a curiosity loop?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:04:08):\nA curiosity loop is essentially going to a whole bunch of people. In this case, I sent out an email very quickly to about 10 or 11 people and asking them, \"Hey, here are nine topics for Lenny's Podcast. What are two or three of the topics that resonate with you and why?\" And I got back such an incredible amount of information for about 20 minutes of work. I don't normally do this, but I actually showed you some of the anonymized feedback from people really just talking about what resonated and what didn't. So I came out of it just so much smarter, and curiosity loops are my method of doing so.\n\nLenny (00:04:42):\nOften, people ask friends for advice on just like, \"Hey, what should I do here? What can I maybe talk",

What can I maybe talk about on this podcast?\" Your approach had a lot of structure to it. So maybe two questions just like, what is the actual structure to this concept? And then two, just people... You can often ask friends for advice, but you also don't want to over bug them with questions. How do you think about just not over asking everyone questions all the time, but all decisions you want to make? So I guess the question is, when do you use this versus just not?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:05:12):\nI think that there are heavyweight and lightweight ways to use this. So the heavyweight way was what I just exemplified by saying, I sent an email and I made a doc. And on the other side, I had all of this really interesting and rich data. The lightweight way to do this is really just make it your ongoing theme of what you're curious about as you interact with people. So maybe it's this thing where every single day as you talk to people, if you have a social topic, you might just bring up the same question over and over again and start looking for are there any differences or surprises in what people are telling you? One of the big reasons why I think curiosity loops are really useful is that it really fights the fact that there's a lot of bad advice out there.\n\n(00:05:54):\nAnd it's not bad because it's not well-intentioned, but it's bad because it's not contextual. So when someone tells you to quit your job and chase your dreams, or they tell you to sit tight and grind through and build some experience before you go off and go start the company that you've always been thinking about starting, which piece of advice do you actually take? Right? A lot of it depends on your situation, what you're considering, what skills and experience you actually have, and curiosity loops actually are this way of really thinking about how do you make your advice contextual. So I'll break it down a bit in terms of how I think about structuring it. So the first piece of a curiosity loop is really just thinking about asking a good question. In the time when I was working at SurveyMonkey in the past, I had this opportunity to spend a lot of time with the survey researchers, and we really talked a lot about what makes a question good.\n\n(00:06:44):\nSo in this case, a question's good if it's specific, if it solicits rationale, and it's not biased. You don't want to start a question with, here's what I think because people have this tendency to want to please you or to agree with you. So a good example... Well, let me start with a bad example of a question. A bad example of a question is, what should I do with my career next? It's just such a poorly formed question because it's really vague, it's not specific. It puts a lot of cognitive load on other people, and the output that you're going to get from it is probably going to be similarly bad. Garbage in, garbage out. A better example of a question might be something like, \"Hey, you know me. I'm a marketer. I've been thinking about doing this webdev thing. So my plan is to quit my job, do a webdev bootcamp and then go find a job elsewhere. Do you think that's a good idea?\"\n\n(00:07:45):\nThere's just so much rich data to actually explore with that. First, are you suited to being a developer? Are webdev boot camps effective? What's the state of the economy in the hiring market right now for junior web developers? And that's an example of maybe a question that's a little bit more specific and gives people something to anchor on. So that's the first piece. The next piece is really around how do you curate who you ask? I think there are two dimensions of this. The first one is the obvious one, which is a subject matter expert who really knows something about the topic at hand. So maybe a webdev themselves, for my example question. Another one, and this dimension I think is really important, is someone who knows you really well and can provide insight on how well does that work for you. And then after that, you really want to ask the question. And this touches on what you said about how do you make it really lightweight?\n\n(00:08:41):\nAsk the question in a way that really gets you a useful constructive answer, but doesn't put too much weight on people. So what I usually like to do is just make it very lightweight. So in your case, I said, \"Here are nine topics. Can you pick your top two and tell me why you like them?\" Some people went above and beyond and scrolled through and gave me feedback on every single topic. Some of them just said, \"Here are my top two, and here's one I think you should avoid.\" I wanted to design it in a way where if you're a busy founder, you're a busy product person, which is the list that I chose for this curiosity loop, you would be able to sit down on your couch at the end of the night, read this interesting email and tap out a quick reply and give me that answer. Because the risk that you're running is either you're getting poor answers or you're getting a really low response rate because you've given them way too much cognitive load in terms of answering it.\n\n(00:09:35):",

Because the risk that you're running is either you're getting poor answers or you're getting a really low response rate because you've given them way too much cognitive load in terms of answering it.\n\n(00:09:35):\nAnd then finally, to close the loop, I think a big piece of it is processing that information and then thanking them for it. So a big misconception that people have when they're really getting into this work of asking for advice or input from other people in the community is often that it's really one-sided. I'm asking you for help and you're getting nothing out of it. The reminder that I would have for all of you is that it feels really good to help someone. It feels really good to be heard and give input. And a big piece of that is, if someone comes to you and they said, \"You gave me this advice, it changed my life. Maybe it's not at that level, but it really affected my decision and here's how it turned out. Thank you so much.\" That feels so good, especially if you only spent a few minutes giving them the input that enabled them to make a better decision.\n\nLenny (00:10:21):\nSo to summarize, I wrote these pieces down. The concept broadly is if you want advice on a decision you're trying to make, pick some friends and this is... I guess I'll go through the four things you just mentioned. And part two is actually pick the right friends. But one is just, come up with a question that's specific. As in just like, what should I do with my life? But more, should I take the specific role at the specific company? Figure out the people that know you well and maybe have some context on this decision. How many people do you usually email for this sort of thing? What's a number?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:10:55):\nI would try to optimize for getting at least three or four responses. It just depends on the nature of the loop. And then you think about what is your response rate. So if you're emailing really busy people that you don't know very well, maybe you would assume that you only get half of people to respond. If you're emailing people really well and it's really lightweight like, yes or no, and here's why, then you might just send out a handful.\n\nLenny (00:11:22):\nOkay, awesome. So it's five to 10 people, broadly sounds like. Oh yeah, you want to make it really quick and easy. So it's like, here's 10 things, which of these two do you think I should focus on? So it's a quick ask as something you recommend, and then just thank them for it after you finish. Is that broadly the approach?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:11:39):\nYep, that's the approach. One thing I want to note is that it's actually really useful for personal things as well. So we framed it in this professional context of, I'm trying to change a job. But one example that I have is when we had our daughter who's now three years old, one of the debates that my partner and I were having was how do we actually set up our estate planning in terms of if, God forbids, something happened to both of us. How should she inherit the state? And my partner was basically saying, \"18 years old, she gets everything fully unlocked.\" I was saying, \"Oh, well maybe 25.\" And we're at this impasse. And we actually just started to tell each other, why don't we, in our day-to-day conversations with folks that we trust in our family, people that we think are smart, that have kids ask people what their perspective is on it.\n\n(00:12:28):\nOne thing was really telling, no one out of everyone we asked said 18. So that really dragged my partner up. And then the other thing that was really interesting was that we learned a little bit about executive function and the research around it. So executive function, which is your ability to make decisions and plans and be thoughtful peaks at the age of 30, and it's all downhill from there. So bad news for people like me that are older.\n\nLenny (00:12:54):\nAnd then I'm getting [inaudible 00:12:54] or game over.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:12:55):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:12:55):\nJust like I'm-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:12:57):\nBut if you're thinking about 18, you are so far from your peak. So it dragged us both up in terms of what our set point was to make a decision like that. But we wouldn't have figured that out without a curiosity loop because it's too much work to dig through papers or research or whatever else to try to come to a good decision on it.\n\nLenny (00:13:14):\nSo the core lesson here is just, versus just emailing a bunch of people, asking for advice, which I imagine people often do, just what should I do here? Creating a little bit of the structure and even calling it a curiosity loop, I bet, helps people feel like they want to be a part of this and participate and help.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:13:31):\nYeah, definitely. One of the things that I always try to do is I try to explain to people in my ask, here's why I picked you. So for example, I picked you because I really trust you to be a sound source of truthful advice and give me some feedback. So I really value",

So for example, I picked you because I really trust you to be a sound source of truthful advice and give me some feedback. So I really value that. Do you mind spending a couple of minutes and just giving me some thoughts on this?\n\nLenny (00:13:53):\nAnd how often are you pinging people? If you're a friend of Ada, are you getting curiosity looped every week, or how often? What's your rate limit?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:14:02):\nI usually reserve it for bigger things. So probably quarterly or anything where I'm having a big debate, and I'm feeling really indecisive.\n\nLenny (00:14:12):\nAwesome. It also makes me think about this idea of a personal board of directors, and this feels like an asynchronous approach to that concept where instead of a call every, I don't know, quarter month with small group, it's asynchronous. Here's an ask I have-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:14:24):\nTotally. Yep. I think this is really based off of the marketing concept of customer advisory councils. So when I was working in marketing and product at a startup, one of the things we would always have is a group of our top customers on DM, basically. And if we had really interesting product conflicts, we would actually just go ping a couple of them and ask them, \"Hey, we're debating this. Do you mind just giving us your quick thoughts and telling us why?\" And then being able to as a marketer come back to the product conversation and say, here is the literal voice of the customer and four or five different verbatims on what people think about this really enabled me as a marketer to have a seat at the table. And the insight and the helpfulness of that was really something I wanted to bring to my personal life as well.\n\nLenny (00:15:07):\nThat's really interesting. It's basically user research for your life. User research, you're told don't do what people tell you to do. I guess it's the same thing here, where it's just like, here's advice and then you end up making the decision for your own own life.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:15:19):\nRight. Right. Yes. That is the big caveat. Don't do what people tell you to do. Take it as an input and look for the hard feedback. Look for things that you strongly disagree with or are surprises to you. Because to me, I think these loops are more about looking around the corner and seeing if there's anything you missed in terms of the integrity of your decision making process.\n\nLenny (00:15:43):\nSweet. You said that people told you what we should not talk about. They're like, \"Don't cover this.\" What was in that list?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:15:50):\nSo I think there were two topics on the list. The first one, it was just how do you onboard and hire and bring people onto the team? And the feedback I got there was like, \"There's just so many people who have done this. I'm sure you have some interesting concepts, but I personally wouldn't be that interested in hearing it. And that was really useful to me. And then the other one was actually just about being a woman in Silicon Valley and the experience of that. I actually had someone write, and you probably read this, Lenny, \"No. Stay far away from this. There's no winning on this topic.\"\n\nLenny (00:16:23):\nOh, my God. Okay, let's touch on that topic rather than, it's going to be great.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:16:28):\nYeah. So let's ignore the advice?\n\nLenny (00:16:29):\nYeah, let's ignore it. Before we get to that, I wanted to first talk about you. You gave me some homework also ahead of this chat. And the homework was around helping me figure out values and personal values for myself. I did the exercise. So first of all, can you just maybe talk about what this exercise was, and what the goal of it is? And then I'll share what I come up with.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:16:51):\nSo the homework that I gave you is similar homework that I give to everyone that I work with in coaching, and it's this values exercise. It's this 10 to 15 minute exercise where you're presented with a list of words that might encompass potential values. It's pretty lightweight. You just go down the list, and you pick out all the words that resonate with you, and then we filter them down into groups of values, and then we filter them down into a stack rank and a list. And the output on the end is basically three to five sentences that cover what are the values stack rank that are important to you right now in your personal and professional life? And what I really like is, it's this internal scorecard of what really matters to you in your decision making process as opposed to the external scorecard of status, money, wealth, how other people perceive you, that often we feel really pressured by. So it's this great way to look back and see how well do decisions, or how well do my situations in life align with my values?\n\nLenny (00:17:53):\nSweet. And what I liked about it is, if someone were to be like, \"Hey, come up with your values.\" I'd be like, \"Oh, my God. I'm just sitting here thinking",

And what I liked about it is, if someone were to be like, \"Hey, come up with your values.\" I'd be like, \"Oh, my God. I'm just sitting here thinking about words and concepts.\" And it was really helpful because it was basically multiple choice. Here's all the options across tons of categories, just keep picking and then helps you whittle them down. I ended up with six. I feel like that's one too many. Actually, I added a bonus one because it's just one that I really like. But should I read through what I came up with?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:18:18):\nYeah, that sounds great.\n\nLenny (00:18:19):\nSo here's what my values, I guess. Choose adventure, stay optimistic, treat others you want to be treated. Classic. Keep getting better, act generously. And added one that my grandma taught me back in the day that has stuck with me, that had nothing to do with this exercise, but I just wanted to have on this list, which is, first do what you need to do, and then do what you want.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:18:44):\nI love it. What a great list of values and what stands out to me from that list too, Lenny, is this idea of achievement or status or success. A lot of the things that we talk about publicly, what your LinkedIn feed might look like don't actually show up in your values. And it must reflect in some of the choices that you've made in your life.\n\nLenny (00:19:04):\nYes, I hope so.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:19:08):\nLet me ask you this. Let's try to apply some of the values in real time as an experiment.\n\nLenny (00:19:14):\nOh, boy.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:19:15):\nIf you think about a recent decision that you've had to make or a decision that you're facing coming up, can you share what that decision might be? And then let's try to apply the values to it to think about if you were living up to these values, what choice would you make and maybe some of the pressures you might feel to choose otherwise.\n\nLenny (00:19:37):\nSo an ongoing decision I have is I have all these opportunities of things I can be doing. Additional things I can be doing. The podcast, this actually was a good example of I never wanted to do a podcast because I really wanted to... Life is good. I was writing this newsletters, doing great, making a living, doing one great email a week. And I was like, \"Why would I do anything more? This is good.\" So I've constantly resisted, I resisted the podcast for two to three years, and then eventually succumbed. And it was a great decision in the end. But now, I have other things that I'm trying to not do, but they're always pushing into my mind space like, a book for example. Of course at one point, and I paused that just so I could have more time for the podcast. So I guess the decision is just like, what should I say yes to versus say no to?\n\n(00:20:26):\nI'm looking at my values a little bit, and one of them is choose adventure, which you would think would be just do stuff, just try stuff out. But I feel like maybe it's just a missing bullet point here of, I just want to do less. I'm trying to take on less and do less and cut out and-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:20:44):\nThat's really interesting.\n\nLenny (00:20:44):\n... simplify. Yeah. Because there's just endless things I could be doing, and I want to spend time with my wife. And now, my new child is coming in a couple of months, if all goes well. So that's where my mind goes when you ask that.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:20:57):\nYeah. Yeah. And then maybe if you were to decompose adventure, what adventure actually means to you and you go into that word list, you might actually just find that some of these opportunities like writing a book, at some point, it doesn't feel like an adventure.\n\nLenny (00:21:13):\nRight. That's so true. The beginning of it is an adventure. And then that's such a good point because yeah, once you start a thing... Something I always say about this content creation life is like, it's easy to start. It's hard to keep it going, and it becomes just this treadmill of just, you have to keep creating awesome stuff basically for the rest of your life. I don't know how you get off the treadmill. Not that I'm complaining, but that's just a reality of this path. So that is such a good point that it becomes not adventurous very quickly. So that's really interesting.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:21:13):\nI love it.\n\nLenny (00:21:42):\nI guess the other thing is just, what's a cutoff? What am I... I do a bunch of angel investing and so I'm thinking about just stopping that for a while just so I get up more time with my new child and just carve out things that maybe aren't as essential.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:21:55):\nSo on the values exercise, I think what you've done a really good job of is just really delineating, here are some examples of choices that you have to make.

I think that there are some points in our lives where writing a book, it just seems really obvious. It's good for your career. It's the next level in terms of where you go from the community, the newsletter, the podcast and getting to that next level. But where I think there is value is these lists of values can help ground us from those obvious decisions. So in my life, to share a mini example of this, there have been a lot of cases where the next obvious step for me might be to go an executive at a big company and to go chase the dream and continue on the latter climb of my career.\n\n(00:22:40):\nAs I've examined my own personal values, a big piece of it has really been around prioritizing relationships and really pursuing knowledge and growth on my own terms. And things like independence and autonomy have started to creep up over time, especially once I started a family. It became very clear to me that sometimes the external scorecard of what people think you should go do is very much an opposition of what I actually want to do. Even though it might be objectively better, depending on what scorecard you actually use, I would actually be less happy with some of those outcomes. So I think values are this really nice useful tool to think about how do you make better decisions again to maximize for your own alignment with life.\n\nLenny (00:23:23):\nThat's such an important point. It connects back to the course that I taught and then this potential book of, it just feels like an obvious thing I should do. It was great, but it just didn't bring me joy. And other things bring me more joy. So it was a really good reminder of just like, do I really want to be doing this, or is this just a thing that feels like a smart thing to do but maybe isn't for me psychologically? So I love just the reminder of coming back to values as a lens to decide if you want to do a thing versus just, what are people telling you? Smart or... Which just feels like the natural thing to do.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:24:00):\nYeah, and it's really self-aware of you too. I think too. Cut it off because you start realizing that you're doing this course, and it's not giving you energy or it's not quite the right thing. It's really hard to say no to things.\n\nLenny (00:24:12):\nIt is. It is.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:24:12):\nAnd I don't think we focus on that enough.\n\nLenny (00:24:14):\nYeah, I've learned how to do that better. I have all these auto templates of ways to say no in different ways. Actually, ChatGPT, somebody's tweeted this that it has all kinds of good suggestions. If you could ask it, how do I say no to my manager who wants me to prioritize a feature? And has all kinds of clever words to [inaudible 00:24:30].\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:24:30):\nOh. Yeah, that's a great use for it.\n\nLenny (00:24:32):\nThe other thing that I realized as we were going through this exercise that I imagine you find also is when you come up with an initial set of values, I was realizing I maybe another value of just keeping things simple, simplifying. And I imagine that's part of the process of narrowing in on what's important to you is you take this first pass and then you try to use it in making a decision and then you realize, oh, there's this other thing that's really important to me and that updates your values.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:24:57):\nYeah, I think you could definitely use that process to force yourself to make a stack ring and to be really clear, and also change it. Change it. It's yours. So change it over time as it suits you.\n\nLenny (00:25:08):\nAll right. It feels like there should be a curiosity loop AI bot with your values that you email, what should I do with this decision? And then it's like, oh, you think simplicity is great? You should not do this.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:25:20):\nThe next big idea.\n\nLenny (00:25:22):\nThere we go. Somebody build that. Okay, so it's funny we went into reverse interview, and then I have to asking questions again. So let's do this. You talked about your career and how you resisted these shiny object opportunities to focus on the thing that you were excited about and wanted to do. So maybe a couple questions there. One is just early career advice. You coach a lot of founders. You had a really in incredible career doing all kinds of interesting things. What have you learned about what works best for optimizing in your early career?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:25:55):\nMy early career was pretty wild. So I had a really fast run. Over the course of seven years, I went from my first job, which was basically this entry level sales job at Microsoft, working on Microsoft adCenter to SVP of marketing at SurveyMonkey, leading a global team. And when I reflect back on what works across my early career, it really comes down in a nutshell to this career concept of explore and exploit, which actually sounds dark now that I'm saying",

Over the course of seven years, I went from my first job, which was basically this entry level sales job at Microsoft, working on Microsoft adCenter to SVP of marketing at SurveyMonkey, leading a global team. And when I reflect back on what works across my early career, it really comes down in a nutshell to this career concept of explore and exploit, which actually sounds dark now that I'm saying it out loud, but-\n\nLenny (00:26:27):\nYeah, sounds great. I love it.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:26:29):\nExplore and exploit, if you're familiar with it from growth background, is really just around what mode you're in. You're either in a mode of explorer where you have a bunch of unknowns and you're testing to see whether or not you like it, how well it works, whether or not it fits for you. Or you're exploiting, where you actually have found something that's really rich and really deep and then you're just trying to get more. And when I think about explore and exploit for early career, it's all about exploration. You really haven't experienced that much, but you're doing it with a thesis. You're doing it with that growth mindset where you have a hypothesis. So coming out of school, my first job was at Microsoft. I was at adCenter. The big thing I learned from the 367 days that I was there was that corporate life at that point in my career was just a little bit too slow-paced for me, and I was really hungry to go do something else.\n\n(00:27:19):\nBut I also learned quite a lot about marketing and advertising. And I had the suspicion that not only did I want to try something smaller, but I also wanted to try marketing. So I moved to this series a startup where I had to sample my desk on the first day called Mochi Media. And I was in a marketing role at a startup and had this great run there over three years, where I learned all kinds of things and even tried product at some point. What I learned from that experience was then I love marketing, games was pretty fun and being in a smaller team was really dynamic. It was this choice on, do I exploit and go deeper into the industry or do I explore more? I was 23 at the time, so I decided I have so little to lose, let me continue exploring. My big thesis was, let me try being a founder. So then I founded Connected, and Connected was this personal CRM that's a little bit like Clay.\n\n(00:28:14):\nIf you've seen Clay now recently, in terms of how do you do a better job of managing and building your professional and personal network and-\n\nLenny (00:28:20):\nYeah. It's a beautiful product.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:28:22):\nYeah, it's a beautiful product, much more beautiful than what we built at the time. It was such a great learning experience to discover what it was like to be a founder of a company and an entrepreneur. My personal learning out of all of those things was really just that I was continuously optimizing that I loved marketing. I loved being a founder. I really like small teams. There are pros and cons to this corporate life, where maybe things are really slow paced, but the scale is really important. So that was really what carried me through a lot of my early career. After Connected was acquired by LinkedIn, I moved into this exploit mode.\n\n(00:28:59):\nSo I was at LinkedIn for a period of time while I was investing, and I really wanted to be intentional about the time that I spent there in terms of how I wanted to exploit it. So unlike a traditional path where you're really focused on trying to get the biggest title, a big team, set yourself up to run a big org, my role at LinkedIn was really explicit. I even told my manager this when I first came in, \"I'm here to learn to be a better founder.\" So there were a lot of things when I started connected, which I didn't know how to do very well, I didn't understand growth. I was fair to middling at pricing. I really didn't understand how to build a subscriptions business and how to price it. So if I can make my LinkedIn experiences match to that, that would be a huge win for me independent of promotion, or compensation or a whole bunch of those things because the plan afterward is actually to go off and start another company.\n\n(00:29:53):\nSo I managed to get into this great role leading gross marketing for LinkedIn, working with their growth team from a hundred million to 200 million members, read every experiment brief that I could, spent a lot of time with the team, really understanding their process, and then shifted into the subscription side where I worked on LinkedIn subscriptions and ran their sales subscriptions business at scale through the online channel. And saw how all of those pieces and worked together from a financial planning and analysis stage to all of the optimizations that they did. It was just such a rare opportunity, but I wouldn't have gotten those opportunities if I just let them promote me or I followed a strategy where I was just focused on trying to get the biggest title.\n\n(00:30:35):\nInstead, I was focused on those learnings and those experiences. Ultimately, the fact that I was a startup founder. I had big company experience. I had growth experience, and I had subs experience. And I was a product marketer. That was actually the winning combination that caused SurveyMonkey to send me a LinkedIn InMail, start a conversation and ultimately bring me in as their head of marketing at the age of, I think I was 27 or 28 at the time.

Because their rationale was, you have all these experiences that we really need and you don't have the management experience, but we have plenty of that. We're happy to teach that to you.\n\nLenny (00:31:10):\nI really like this framework. I've never heard it described this way. Explore and exploit connects a lot with what I always recommend which, early on, is to optimize for a variety of experience so that you can figure out where you actually have a good time and what you're interested in versus getting stuck on the first thing something. I don't know if you'll have an immediate answer to this, but I'm curious. Many people don't know how long to stick with something that maybe doesn't feel good but may lead to something. Like, someone may be in a job right now, or just like, \"I really don't like this job, but I feel like it'll lead to something great. And I don't want to give up too quickly.\" So I guess the question is, what are heuristics that tell you to stick it out and stick with something that you think will lead to something great versus hold the recording and get out?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:32:01):\nThat's a great question, and it's a really tough one that is contextual on the person that you are. So one of the things that I like to share is this idea of, it's a little gory, don't be the frog. So if you are familiar with the story of the frog, it's this idea of boiling the frog. So if you take a frog, and you throw in a pot of boiling water, it'll jump out. But if you take a frog and you put in a pot and you increase the temperature degree by degree by degree, the frog doesn't notice and before it knows, it's boiled alive. And how I apply this to your question to come back and circle back to it is that, it's really easy to be a victim of inertia. It's really easy for all of us to be the frog where there are little things that make us uncomfortable, and we sit with them or we think, \"Gosh, it'll get better. The next manager will get better. I'm always one conversation or one promotion away from getting to that next step.\"\n\n(00:33:02):\nBut you really have to be aware of your surroundings. You have to be aware of which way is the direction of the temperature of the water trending. That's what makes the advice really contextual. I really look at it from the lens of learning. What can I learn here, and how am I growing and developing? So there might be an argument for you to stay at a job for two decades. If it turns out that every single day you're being really challenged, you're learning new things, you're deriving a lot of meaningful enjoyment out of your work and you're this happy frog that's hanging out, realizing that things are good and the temperature is not rising. But there are also situations where you might encounter just some really hard walls, where you don't get along with the thesis of the company. You don't agree with the direction of the company that you're in.\n\n(00:33:53):\nThere are fundamental aspects of the role which are limiting to you or you're not learning a lot, frankly. I think that happens a lot, where you providing a lot of value and doing a good job at a company, but you might not be learning things that stretch you and grow you to achieve your ultimate goal. When you are aware of that learning, I think that's the point at which you have to say, \"How do I change that? How do I be an agent in my own career and make a difference in that?\" And it doesn't necessarily mean that the strategy is to quit your job and do something catastrophic, and then go do something else, take a course or sign up for something new. It might actually mean a proactive conversation with your manager or the leadership to say, \"I love what I'm doing here, and I would also like to learn a little bit more. And here's what I'm interested in.\"\n\n(00:34:44):\nAnd then try to find a way to either land the right projects. So in my case, it was really growth and subscriptions, that experience that I really wanted. Let's say, you hit a blank wall there, even take it as a gift of time, which is great. I'm not going to be able to get this from my company, but now that I have this extra time because I'm so optimized at this job, how am I going to choose to use that time? And it might be around building relationships with some of the key people at the company or learning something new on your own time that you can leverage in another way.\n\nLenny (00:35:17):\nI like that. Make the most of the time, even if it's not the best opportunity for you. Also love the frog boiling metaphor.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:35:23):\nLittle gory.\n\nLenny (00:35:24):\nNo, it's great. So I guess the lesson there is think about are you that frog being boiled right now and think ahead, is this going to be the end of the-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:35:24):\nRight. Keep an eye on your environment and which way is it trending?\n\nLenny (00:35:35):\nYeah, the temperature on the thermostat in your office. The other thing this",

Keep an eye on your environment and which way is it trending?\n\nLenny (00:35:35):\nYeah, the temperature on the thermostat in your office. The other thing this makes me think about is, it's so easy to get caught up in making your resume look amazing and continuing to just like, \"Oh, if I get this next role, my resume's going to look so great.\" And this other logo and this cool title and role. I find that just like, you do that long enough in your life, you end up... You retire, and then you die. Life is that resume. Right? That is your life, you're living, and there's not going to be a point at which you have to realize, okay, I've done all the things to make my resume. Also, I'm like, \"What do I actually want to do? Am I enjoying this?\" Because it'll never end. You're never going to end trying to make a better resume and a more awesome background for yourself. Do you experience that with yourself or other people you work with of just over optimizing to make an awesome series of roles and logos and then forgetting, do I actually enjoy any of this? What am I doing?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:36:31):\nI have experienced that personally a lot. I think that it may be a generational thing or it just may be my background, but having grown up with the Asian tiger parenting, it's very focused on logos or certain accomplishments or certain achievements like, going to an Ivy League school, working in a company that someone's heard of, being able to have a certain title. At a certain point, I bailed out a bit and I really started to think about who am I trying to please and optimize for? That values exercise that I had you do, Lenny, is actually a big piece of that. So I probably took it for the first time over a decade ago, at this point. I looked at those values and I said, \"Well, if I draw a straight line from where I am right now and just extend it forward and play the rest of the movie as it plays out, given the current plot line, how well does that optimize for those values?\"\n\n(00:37:27):\nThat's great. My parents might be happy about my resume or other people might look upon me in a certain way because I've managed these achievements, but in my day-to-day life, what really matters to me, what's really meaningful to me, only some of this stuff really matters. So getting very intentional about that and being clear about who your audience is as you navigate your career. I think it's a terrible outcome to wake up one day and be late career and feel trapped because you have a certain lifestyle or a certain expectations of the people around you that you have to go work this job, but then you look at yourself in the mirror and you're not happy going in there. I think that's a terrible trap that we should all try to avoid as we navigate our career paths and find the thing that's most optimal for us, which is usually a mix of career success, but also meaningfulness and alignment in the work that we're doing with our values.\n\nLenny (00:38:25):\nI love this topic. Thank you for sharing that. This episode is brought to you by Sprig. You already heard me talk about how Sprig helps you uncover blind spots in your product development process, allowing you to better understand why users take certain actions and how they feel about the experience. Just this week, they launched their brand new templates library, which you can find at sprig.com/templates. Which helps you plug and play proven playbooks for helping you identify and solve the biggest challenges facing product teams today. From how to optimize an existing feature to improving a conversion flow, to troubleshooting drop off. One of the questions I get most on this podcast and in my newsletter is how to develop your product sense. So I decided to work with Sprig to build a playbook for how to do just that, based on my experience at Airbnb and what I learned from interviewing top product people like, Jules Walter who wrote a whole guest post on how to develop your product sense, which informed this template that you'll find. Just go to sprig.com/templates to find this playbook and 85 more that is sprig.com/templates. S-P-R-I-G.com/plates.\n\n(00:39:31):\nWhat triggered your reevaluation of that path? Was there just like a, \"Oh, man. I need to really rethink where I'm going.\" And then I have a follow-up question.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:39:40):\nReally just a career opportunity. And it was this step where I could do something that was, at the time, really high profile and really exciting and felt great, but also involved demanding travel and grueling hours. And wasn't in a space that I was excited about, but it looked amazing on my resume. And I was talking to a friend about it, and they actually introduced me to this values exercise to say like, \"Ada, go through and fill out this values exercise, and apply it to this job.\" What I realized at the time, after I did it, was that my top three values, the things that I cared about this job would categorically just fail at because I would be gone all the time, in pursuit of glory that I didn't really care about. Instead, my current path at the time was something that if I persisted in, it would actually be able to potentially fulfill all of those values.\n\nL",

Instead, my current path at the time was something that if I persisted in, it would actually be able to potentially fulfill all of those values.\n\nLenny (00:40:36):\nIt reminds me of a friend who has this metaphor of this ego monster sitting in the corner of the room that's always yelling at them, when they're... To do the thing that's impressive and take on the really cool role, and just get an awesome title, and do something really impressive, that's just like yelling at them from the corner. And my friend's just learned to just like, \"Okay, that's the ego monster pulling at me. I don't have to listen to that. Doesn't mean I'm going to be happy if I listen to this guy.\" And that's been really helpful to my friend just to disassociate that part of the brain.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:41:10):\nYeah. The ego monster is a great way to put it. I use something that Warren Buffet has talked about, which is inner scorecard versus outer scorecard.\n\nLenny (00:41:19):\nTell me more.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:41:20):\nSo he talks about how there's an outer scorecard, which is how the rest of the world evaluates you, how you keep score in terms of external factors. So top 10 lists, wealth status, title, maybe things that people really care about. And then your inner scorecard is things that actually matter to you, how you spent your day, how good of a person you are. Did you have an adventure today, Lenny? Were you kind? And there are a lot of things that maybe are in opposition to each other. So really thinking about did you win at the cost of kindness? Did you succeed at the cost of losing access to the adventure that you really wanted? I think really thinking about it in that lens helps you trade off against some of that external pressure and the ego monster.\n\nLenny (00:42:11):\nThis might be a good segue to chat about coaching. I imagine a lot of people listening to this like, \"Yes, I want to do that. I want to measure myself according to my values and check in on this. And am I doing the wrong path?\" It's hard to do just on your own, I find. And I think that's one of the benefits of an executive coach. So maybe we just chat about what should people know about coaching and getting a coach, and does everyone need a coach and how to think about the idea of getting a coach at some point in their career.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:42:42):\nI'll have a hot take on this, and it's something that I share to people when I talk to them about coaching. But my hot take is that for the vast majority of people, they probably do not need a coach.\n\nLenny (00:42:52):\nGreat.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:42:54):\nAnd what I often push people on is if you're thinking about getting a coach, which is usually an indication that they have a feeling of being stuck or they have a problem that they're trying to solve, I ask them, \"What are your goals when it comes to coaching? Roll it forward six months, what have you gotten done in your coaching experience. What have you accomplished, and you're just... It's like, a home run. And then look at all of the potential alternatives in terms of how you could have spent your valuable time and often pricey fees to achieve the same goal, but maybe in a better way.\" The thing that people don't really think about is if you're looking for a mentor, a coach is actually a terrible mentor in some ways because it's this one person's opinion. It's actually way better to run a curiosity loop, for example, and get the benefit a couple different minds on a specific topic and hit their wheelhouse of things that they know about. Than to go ask one person, what do you think I should do in this situation?\n\n(00:43:58):\nIf you're trying to learn about a topic in a really robust way, let's say you want to learn about growth, maybe you should take are Reforge course and get access to all of the resources and the insights of the EIRs and the growth advisors that Reforge and get an overview and survey of the landscape instead of one person's experience and the handful of companies that they might have worked with. Likewise, if you're just feeling like you're a little emotionally overcome, I think coaches are this great resource around that, but it's actually better to pay it forward and build a tribe and a community of people around you that you can rely on for support because that's the thing that lasts you for years and years.\n\n(00:44:38):\nSo one of the first things that I do when people talk to me about coaching is I challenge them and say, \"Have you explored all of these other opportunities first, and do you really need a coach? And is a coach actually the best option for you?\" Like an anti sell, just so that they know what they're getting themselves into because I don't necessarily think that it's useful for all things, even though it can be helpful.\n\nLenny (00:44:59):\nAnd then when do you find that it's actually important and valuable and something someone should try to get?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:45:06):\nI wouldn't be a coach if I didn't think that it wasn't important and valuable. I think that in certain contexts it can be super helpful. So when you have situations",

I think that in certain contexts it can be super helpful. So when you have situations where you're in a state of hyper growth, and you need very accelerated learning, and you need someone who can point you in the right direction, I think coaches can be really helpful. So I work with founders for example, and founders are just in this unique state where everything is chaos. They have no structure. They don't know what their jobs are. They have fully justified imposter syndrome where no one in their right mind would objectively have hired them for the position that they're in. There's really intense highs and lows. So for a founder, it might make a lot of sense to get a coach because they have to learn a lot of stuff really quickly, and time is of the essence.\n\n(00:45:54):\nSo a coach might be a really helpful shortcut for them to get there. Related to that, I think it's also really helpful on sensitive topics. So there are a lot of things that we want to be coached on where either it takes a lot of time for us to work through and progress because it's a long-term project, for example, or it's something very sensitive. People issues and interpersonal conflicts. Coaches can be especially helpful in those cases because it's this really safe space for you to work through things, but also have someone who's really rational to help guide you through them with potentially some frameworks and extra advice.\n\nLenny (00:46:30):\nSo I had a couple coaches in my career and what made me feel like I should pursue that is when you think about a sports athlete or, I don't know, athlete. No one does not have a coach, the best athletes have coaches and they get great because they have somebody helping them get better. It's not just like an accident. They don't just learn on their own. It just makes you realize that other people in their profession that have a coach helping them out are just going to be more successful because innately, they have someone helping them learn how to do the job better. So that made me realize, man, I should probably get a coach to help me out with stuff. Even though there wasn't anything super specific, I'm like, \"Oh, I need to fix this problem.\" It was just like, wow, this just intellectually make sense. So it was actually really important and transformative for me.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:47:21):\nIf you go to my site, I actually have this guide that I've written over time on both my take on how do you find a coach, and the TLDR there is actually that I strongly recommend to everyone. If you're thinking about getting a coach, talk to two or three different coaches. And really get a sense of their vibe and how well you get to know them. It's surprising because I did this piece of research, which I also wrote about, and we could link to, but I talked to over 80 people about their experiences with a coach. I talked including coaches, including founders, including executives and there's this shocking data point in there where half of people that founder their coach literally went with the first coach that they talked to. It's that your buddy said, \"I work with this great coach.\" And then you go and you hire your buddy's coach.\n\n(00:48:08):\nI think that's a totally fine way to go find a coach, but I would actually really just urge people to talk to a couple because what works for your friend may not work for you. And just being able to see some of the variance in terms of the style and how people get along, I think that can make a huge difference in terms of this reflection of how do you learn best? When you think about acquiring a new skill, do you love structure? Do you not like structure? Do you like it when someone really teaches you and walks you through specific examples, or do you frameworks? Coaches come in all of those different flavors. So I think it's really worth it to explore before you get into such a deep relationship with someone, just so that both people can feel really sure about it.\n\nLenny (00:48:51):\nWhat's one thing that people may not think about or just something that you find really important that maybe is unexpected when you're looking for a coach?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:49:00):\nI thought that credentials and the relevant experience of the coach was a huge factor in terms of how you should go about your coach selection. But part of the interviews that I did was talking to founders that had had experiences with coaches and asking them to reflect back, and these founders and executives when they thought about it, they actually said so much more about, it was actually this amorphous sense of vibe with the person, how safe you felt with them, how deeply you would explore with them, and how well they got you, and remembered the pieces of the conversation and help you put it together. Way more than potentially some experiences that they'd had, where this person had the perfect background, but they just never really connected on that level. So it was unintuitive to me that there was such a big piece of it that was around personal connection, which is why I've now pushed people to try to talk to a couple different people.\n\n(00:49:55):\nAnd then the other thing which comes back to the sports coaching analogy is that there are different coaches that are really good at different things. So just like how, if you're a star tennis player, you might",

So just like how, if you're a star tennis player, you might actually have multiple coaches working with you, maybe an offensive coach or a defensive coach or working on a particular swing. It actually makes sense when you're really performing at a high level to consider having coaches that work with you on shorter term basis to really just work on your speaking or help you with getting into your groove on writing or help you achieve a specific goal. You shouldn't think about it as this long-term commitment to stay with one person, but instead more choosing off of a menu and thinking about what goal are you trying to achieve right now?\n\nLenny (00:50:39):\nDoes anyone ever get multiple executive coaches that... I like how we went from, you don't need a coach to maybe need a month [inaudible 00:50:46] hamstrings.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:50:48):\nYes. I know of multiple people that I've talked to, usually CEOs, that either have had a series of coaches or have multiple coaches. It makes a lot more sense, Lenny, when you think about someone who's getting a pitch coach because they're about to get into fundraising.\n\nLenny (00:51:04):\nGot it. Right. Niche skills.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:51:05):\nRight. For niche things because they're about to enter a process or someone who's trying to get into a writing coach-\n\nLenny (00:51:11):\nGot it. Yeah.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:51:13):\n... in addition to some of their executive and leadership work that they might be doing.\n\nLenny (00:51:17):\nOkay. That makes sense. I love it. I'm going to get four coaches. One for everything I do\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:51:23):\nA podcast coach.\n\nLenny (00:51:23):\nPodcast coach.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:51:25):\nA newsletter coach.\n\nLenny (00:51:26):\nA writing coach, and a-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:51:30):\nYes. And then a parent coach. Don't forget that.\n\nLenny (00:51:30):\nParent coach. A job board coach, and then just a life coach. Okay. I'm on it. Okay. So let's touch on the thing that your friends said we shouldn't touch on, which is being a woman in leadership in Silicon Valley. I guess I'll just frame it simply. Imagine there's many young women listening to this podcast, and many may dream of a career like yours, all the things you've shared. What advice do you have for young women just starting out in their career hoping to find a similar path?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:52:03):\nThis is a really delicate subject, and it's interesting because when I try to decompose why people gave me the feedback they gave me on this topic, I think a big piece of it is just that you want to have respect for the inherent challenges of being a non stereotypically great fit for leadership roles or certain career success roles in Silicon Valley and acknowledge that. And also try to push for some of the agency of the things that you can do. So I'm going to start with just this quick story about someone that I worked with who's given me permission to share this, in a coaching context and then back out. So I was working with a seed stage founder, and she's so smart. She is really dynamic, very, very focused, really, really great at taking feedback and actioning it. She's one of those people that is just stellar, and I have no doubt that she's going to make a huge dent in the universe.\n\n(00:52:58):\nWe've been working together on Zoom for a couple of months, and I'd built this great respect for her competence as an operator, and the way that she thought and took apart problems and then acted on them. And then we met together for the first time in person at lunch. I feel almost nervous talking about this here. The disparity between my sense of who she was as an operator and how she came across to me initially at this lunch was really striking in that it was a weekday lunch and she was dressed as if she was hanging out on the weekend. So old T-shirt, hair back and in a claw, bra straps were showing. She was just incredibly casual in terms of her physical appearance. It took me almost like a little bit of a step back to reevaluate and think, \"Oh, this is the same person, but she actually just presents so differently.\n\n(00:53:54):\nSo then I took the step after we met and I gave her that feedback in one of our next coaching sessions where we invited each other to give each other feedback. I shared a lot of my impressions with her and I told her, \"I respect you so much as an operator. I want to tell you that in the physical meeting that we had together, there was this disparity on how I would've potentially perceived you when I first met you in person versus what I've come to know about you from the months that we spent together.\"\n\n(00:54:27):\nHer reaction was like, \"Oh my God, Ada. No one has ever connected the dots for me. Thank you so much. It has never explicitly been told to me that some of these elements which you describe, and they're very easy for me to fix and I'm motivated",

No one has ever connected the dots for me. Thank you so much. It has never explicitly been told to me that some of these elements which you describe, and they're very easy for me to fix and I'm motivated to fix them, are things that might actually trigger certain impressions or biases. No one's actually said it to me before, and I'm about to go into fundraising. It's actually super helpful for me to hear this, that these are controllable elements of my physical attire or my appearance that might actually just affect the way that people perceive me. And then it gives me this extra hump to get over, in terms of getting to this point of credibility for them to see me as a seasoned operator that I am.\" She took it so well. But what was interesting about it was actually that she'd made it all this way in her career. She'd even raised funding, and no one had ever given her this feedback.\n\n(00:55:21):\nSo this is, I think one of the big challenges of being a woman in Silicon Valley because getting to an executive role or getting to a funded founder role, it's like an Olympic level sport. You have to get all the way through the funnel and become one of the few that are really chosen to do that. But the difficulty of this game is that no one tells you the rules of the game. You actually don't really know what are the rules on how to get intros or give intros. What's the right way to follow up? What are the impressions that people have about you? It turns out that in a career context, it's so unsafe for your manager to turn to a young woman on the team and say, \"Here, let me give you feedback on your physical appearance, and how it affects your competence and how you're perceived in the workforce.\" That the vast majority of them will just never do it because there's no winning, which is similar to the feedback that I got.\n\n(00:56:16):\nSO where I lean in is to say, we're not powerless and there's something that all of us can do if we're in a position where we feel like not even about being female, it's about being perceived as too young or too old, too tall, too short, not the right race. Whatever reason that you feel people may be disqualifying you or not seeing you. We're not powerless, even though this game is rigged. We can study the game, we can help each other, and we can actually start to call out some of those rules and then find ways around them. In this case, for the founder in this example, she really turned to her friends and did a mini makeover and amped up her appearance.\n\n(00:57:03):\nAnd she came back and she reported, \"A lot of people have been giving me really positive feedback, that something about me feels more confident and more energetic, and they can't figure out why.\" But actually, she was getting a ton of people noticing that something was really different about her in a positive way simply because I was in this great position as her coach to give her some of these pieces of hard feedback that she had never heard before. So it's really on us to try to find those and then try to adapt ourselves to play that game if you want to play at that level.\n\nLenny (00:57:33):\nHow nervous were you giving her that feedback?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:57:37):\nI was so nervous. I actually almost didn't do it, and then took a deep breath and then decided, what the heck? I think she's great. I think she would really benefit from doing it and I gave it. Even in a position where I'm in a relationship with her where I can have that trust, it was super, super difficult. So I can only imagine how hard it is for people to give feedback like that in another context, but how else are people going to hear it?\n\nLenny (00:58:03):\nI think there was a company culture where they talk about how you're being selfish, not giving someone hard feedback because you don't want to be stressed or risk causing damage to your own reputation. But you're not helping them. So it's a really interesting insight of just like, don't be selfish. Do something that's hard when you think it's going to help someone else.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:58:26):\nRight. But I think on the topic of being female or on the topic of physical appearance or maybe even some of the topics around being an immigrant, if you're in a position where you can give that feedback, I think the struggle is often will it be well received? And that's where the feedback comes from me from the curiosity loop for this piece, which was there's almost no winning in doing it because the upside is something great happens for them. But there's just so many downsides to giving advice or giving someone input like that the default course is just to avoid. But then that person never learns the rules of the game.\n\nLenny (00:59:05):\nYeah, absolutely. It makes me think also a little bit about Radical Candor, basically. I don't know if you read that book, but\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:59:14):\nYeah, Kim Malone Scott, I think.\n\nLenny (00:59:16):\nYeah. And Sheryl Sandberg had a similar story where she... I think Sheryl Sandberg gave her a really hard feedback and she didn't take it that well, actually. I think you did a better job, or your friend actually took the feedback and did something with it. I think the whole book",

I think Sheryl Sandberg gave her a really hard feedback and she didn't take it that well, actually. I think you did a better job, or your friend actually took the feedback and did something with it. I think the whole book was just like, \"Hey, I actually do this where people actually listen.\" I think the framework is, you got to communicate that you care deeply about that person, but you want to challenge them directly also at the same time.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (00:59:40):\nYeah, it's a great story. I think Sheryl Sandberg took her aside after one of her meetings and basically told her that, \"If you say um, it makes me sound stupid.\" And she didn't take that well, but at the same time, later on in retrospect, she reflected that it was so brave and so helpful of someone like Sheryl to go give that feedback because there's a real cost to it. There's real risk to it.\n\nLenny (01:00:09):\nAny other thoughts or advice along these lines that you want to leave people with?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:00:13):\nThe biggest piece of advice that I have that comes to mind is really around trying to be really thoughtful on something I call eating your vegetables. So I have all these branded terms for things, but-\n\nLenny (01:00:13):\nThat's great.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:00:30):\n... eating your vegetables is really this idea around how little kids don't really develop an appreciation for vegetables until they're 10 or 12 exposures in. So the researchers say, \"Expose kids to vegetables 10 or 12 times, even if they don't like it, because that's what it takes to get someone to like something.\" So when I think about career strategy and when I think about improving yourself and I think about how do we look for some of the hard feedback, eating your vegetables is this really important component of it because it's about how do you identify dislike for something because you're bad at it or you're new to it or you've never done it before, compared to genuine dislike where you've done it and you really don't like it. So to make it a little bit real, if we think about the world of podcasts, Lenny, I think it's something like 75 or 80% of podcasts never make it past the first podcast.\n\n(01:01:25):\nYou have to do things a number of times before you really develop an affinity for it. Because the first time you do it, you're just not going to be good. So my mini example of that was early on in my career, I was really awkward and not very good at networking. I moved to Silicon Valley and one of the things that people told me about Silicon Valley was that it's really important to grow your network. It's all about the people. Totally agree about that. However, I didn't know anyone, and I didn't really understand this networking thing. So I gave myself this rule where I had to go out once a week for a couple of months, go to an external event, and I would count out 10 business cards. And the rule was, I had to hand out all 10 of those business cards by introducing myself to people that were new, and touch the back wall of the venue of that event and then I could leave.\n\n(01:02:15):\nI did that a couple of weeks in a row, and it was horrible. It was really awful, but it got a lot better. What I realized about that was actually two things. One that, as I started going and I saw familiar faces, it became a lot easier for me to just break in and meet people, just by seeing who people I knew already were talking to. And then second, I got a lot better at just breaking in and introducing myself and understanding how this intro and networking thing worked in terms of meeting people and moving through a crowd. Some of those relationships now from that first job and those first couple months are pretty much foundational to the network and the people that I know today. So it really paid off for me because I really focused on eating my vegetables and powering through that initial discomfort.\n\n(01:03:00):\nSo to title back when it comes to thinking about how do you progress in your career, think about the obvious things that maybe you're not very good at, and then think about what are some of the actions that you can do to be very deliberate and intentional about practicing it to get to the point where you have some faculty at it because it's just really important in some cases to be good at certain skills.\n\nLenny (01:03:24):\nI really like that. I also really like the physicality of that rule of touching the back wall. It just forces you to go through a room, and I just escape really quickly. Is there any other examples of things you've seen or recommend for doing things like, eating vegetables? That was a really good example of just forcing yourself to go to a networking event, touch the back wall. Is there anything else, any other examples that come to mind that you've recommended or found useful, doing something really hard that was really impactful?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:03:53):\nYeah. So there are actually a few of them. A lot of them around content creation because it's just so hard. So one of them that comes to mind is, I know a lot of people have talked about doing a LinkedIn 30. So 30 days of posting something on LinkedIn in terms of content every day for 30 days straight, and just getting past that barrier",

I don't think anyone has those anymore.\n\nLenny (01:04:34):\nNo.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:04:35):\nBut modern networking is finding people that are really interesting on the internet and then finding some way to connect with them. It takes a certain amount of extroversion in that case to start meeting up with people and having conversations with them. So forcing yourself in some way to really think about, \"Well, instead of having one outreach and then failing at it and saying, 'I'm never doing that again.' How do I actually create a pattern where I can learn or a sequence of trying to do this 10 or 12 times, and see what I get out of it?\" Because that's really how you learn and how you grow.\n\nLenny (01:05:07):\nThe LinkedIn 30 idea, I like a lot. Something that I'll share as a tip is when you hear that, I bet a lot of people are just like, \"Oh, my God. Going to link post on LinkedIn. So cringey. I don't want to be this self-promotiony LinkedIn person.\" But what I find is if you reframe it to, \"I just want to crystallize a thought that I have and just share something that is useful to me or an insight I've had, and not think of it from, I'm trying to get as many likes. I'm trying to go viral with this post, or I'm trying to just build some following.\" Just don't think of it that way. Think of it as just want to communicate a thought I have and use this opportunity to crystallize it in a really simple way. That helps motivate. That, at least, works for me. It also ends up being useful for me. It's not like I'm trying to grow some following as a result of that.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:05:59):\nI find that really helpful as well. One piece of advice that's similar to that that I've heard is, write for an audience of one. Imagine you're just talking to a friend or you're trying to talk to someone that's a trusted colleague, and just write for them. I think that's really helpful, and it helps us with the problem of getting in over your skis, really over fixating on the outcome of, I did a post and I didn't get my 5,000 followers. And instead, just thinking about I did a post because I wanted to share an interesting idea, and then how cool, some people resonated with it.\n\nLenny (01:06:31):\nYeah, I love that. You could just even say, something I found useful day one and just approach it that way. That's the stuff that end up being most interesting to people. The less it feels like you're trying to be thirsty for followers and likes and all that stuff. And the more it's just like, here's the thing I've found useful. Enjoy it, if you can.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:06:49):\nYeah. Yeah. People can really tell when you're being genuine and authentic online.\n\nLenny (01:06:53):\nAbsolutely. More and more. Maybe a last question. You started a company with your partner. You're both co-founders, you and your husband. I'm curious, what's your take on that approach to starting company? Would you recommend for other folks or not?f\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:07:10):\nIf you had asked me when I first started the company, it would've been an enthusiastic hell yes. I totally recommend. Now, I have a couple asterisks on top of it, and-\n\nLenny (01:07:10):\nGo on.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:07:23):\n... I think it really just goes back to what I was talking about earlier where being a founder is such a traumatic and crazy experience with all these intense highs and lows and lack of structure that when you throw romance into the mix, it's just this really volatile combination. So what I've found is that it seems like it either goes really well or it goes really badly, and there's no in between. And asterisks are there because we've actually had a couple of friends try it, and it's been such a mixed bag of results. So my personal experience is I love it. My partner Sachin, and I work really well together. And the main benefit that we have is that the active founding is such an active obsession that you spend so much of your time thinking about your business and the concepts of your business and whatever problem you happen to be facing.\n\n(01:08:11):\nThat when I had this thesis of I want to be a founder too, we played it out and said, \"Well, okay, now we're going to walk around being obsessed about two completely different things. We may never see each other, and so why not try the same thing?\" So our first experiment was actually trying it together, and",

We may never see each other, and so why not try the same thing?\" So our first experiment was actually trying it together, and we were nuts. I actually had a 30, 60 and 90 day plan where we would have check-ins. And some of the explicit questions in the check-in, is this affecting our relationship? Because I just wanted to make sure we were putting our relationship first. It worked well for us to the extent that we've done two companies together. And then when we were at LinkedIn, we actually moved across multiple teams in the company and continued to be counterparts and product and marketing together. So it's been phenomenal. The thing that I would say really helps us in terms of making it a successful relationship was things that I think apply to anyone that's thinking about, should you work with a person and should you be a co-founder with this person?\n\n(01:09:08):\nWe had a very, very good set of complimentary domains and skillsets, so we had really clear decision making rights. Sachin does product design and engineering. I focus on marketing, operations, finance, everything else on the business side. And because of that, it's really clear that we take input from each other, but ultimately who makes the call and who's driving and owning that project. So that was really helpful for us. And then the big part that I think is the murky Meyer for couples and maybe even for close friends working together is how do you engage in constructive conflict? How do you get to the point where you're attacking the problem and not each other? So if your partner comes to you and says that work was not good, that marketing plan or that product roadmap that you put together, not good, do you take it as the plan is not good and let's talk about what we can actually do to fix it?\n\n(01:10:06):\nOr do you take it as, \"Oh, gosh, they think I'm not good. They think I'm too lazy. I saw that look that they were giving me.\" And take it as this personal offense. So the ability to be really truth seeking and take the most respectful interpretation when you're giving feedback to focus on trying to get to a smart good outcome that benefits the business, I think that's actually one of the most crucial things that you have to think about. If you're going to work with anyone. Much less your partner or a close friend on starting a company and what's really worked for us,\n\nLenny (01:10:37):\nI am very impressed with how you're able to execute on this. I don't think I could do this with my wife. That would not go well, I think. You should probably write-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:10:37):\nThat's self awareness.\n\nLenny (01:10:48):\nYeah. No, we're aware. You should write a post on how to successfully build a company with your partner. That seems like you have a lot of really interesting frameworks and insights on how it's worked. The fact that-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:10:57):\nThat's a good idea.\n\nLenny (01:10:58):\n... [inaudible 01:10:58] for so long. Yeah, it could be its own little book. Is there anything else you wanted to share or touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:11:06):\nI think you covered most of it, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:11:08):\nWith that then, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:11:15):\nI am ready.\n\nLenny (01:11:17):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:11:20):\nPersuasion by Robert Cialdini. I think it's a great book, if you're a marketer. It's a great book, if you're a founder or product person. But it really is a breakdown of what are the different strategies to get people to say yes and help persuade them toward things. I think it really helps in terms of thinking through that and designing a product or a business around it.\n\nLenny (01:11:40):\nI've got that in my bookshelf behind me.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:11:43):\nOh, yeah. It's a great book. Yeah. The next book that I also recommend is a book called Designing Your Life, and it's out of the Stanford Design School. And it's by, let me look, Bill Burnett and Dave Evans. They're two Stanford D School professors, and what they're doing is they're applying design principles to life design. So how do you actually map that next level career that's both meaningful and fulfilling and also achieves maybe some of the success factors that you really care about, and brainstorm and be really creative about it. So when people are stuck or thinking about career strategy, that's actually one of the books that I always point out for them.\n\nLenny (01:12:23):\nWhat's a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:12:25):\nSo Ted Lasso is back, so I'm watching that, the newest season. I am also a Star Trek nerd, so I'm watching Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.\n\nLenny (01:12:25):\nI didn't know there's a new Star Trek. That's good to know.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (",

I am also a Star Trek nerd, so I'm watching Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.\n\nLenny (01:12:25):\nI didn't know there's a new Star Trek. That's good to know.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:12:41):\nOh, It's so good. I think the thing I love about Star Trek is just that, unlike some of the classic storylines that you see right now on TV coming out now, sometimes the episodes are just happy. They explore a planet. Nothing bad happens. They see something really wondrous. They all leave happy, and they pat themselves on the back for having explored something. It's something that's missing in the genre of TV that they still have, this happiness factor where sometimes life is good and sometimes life is bad.\n\nLenny (01:13:09):\nI like the sound of that. Although, I've learned about storytelling for a story to be interesting. There needs to be some conflict or problem. So I imagine there's something going wrong somewhere in the middle.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:13:20):\nBut it's not wrong. It's something interesting happens.\n\nLenny (01:13:23):\nOh.\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:13:23):\nAnd then it's resolved, and it's happy. Right. But it just doesn't always need to be, something tries to kill you.\n\nLenny (01:13:28):\nI got to watch that. That sounds great. I was a huge Star Trek fan back in the day. Didn't know they were still making new ones. What's a favorite interview question you like to ask when you're interviewing people?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:13:37):\nWhat's a common misconception people have about you? I usually like to throw that in toward the end of the interview, and the reason why I think it's really useful is it's a way for me to reset my bias. I may have had a certain impression about them, and this is their opportunity to speak up and say, \"Hey, a lot of people think this about me, but it's not true.\" It's also this reflection of their self-awareness.\n\nLenny (01:14:01):\nGreat. What are some products that you've recently discovered or use regularly, SaaS products or even consumer fun random products that you want to share?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:14:14):\nYeah. I can't go through this podcast without giving a shout-out to Notejoy. So Notejoy is a fast and focused notes app for individuals and teams. So that's the company that I work on. So I use it for everything from Noora product roadmaps to my coaching notes, to even prepping for something like this podcast. I use Notejoy all the time. Another one that I really use a lot is Captio. It's been around for a while, but it's a little iOS app. I don't know if it's on Android, but basically it's a blank notepad. You can dump your brain into it, and there's one button, and it emails it to you. So when I find that I'm really distracted, or I just want to remember something, I use Captio all the time just to quickly capture my ideas. And then I process it later in my inbox.\n\n(01:14:53):\nAnd then something that I just downloaded this week is Arc, the new browser. I'm actually really excited about its vision. I'm not sure if I'm going to work it into my workflow yet or how it fits in, but it's really beautiful and it's really cool to see someone iterating on the cluster that is browser tabs.\n\nLenny (01:15:11):\nYep. Love Arc. Went deep on Arc in the previous episode and I used Captio, however you call it. And I found another app, actually, the similar thing that I found even more simple. It's called Note to Self, just sits on my doc. Anytime I want to email myself a thought, I open it up and this type of thing. Somehow, it ends up being even easier. So that's another one to check out, Note to Self. Final question. You're really big on productivity. What's one tip that you found that has been really helpful for you in your day-to-day life, being more productive?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:15:43):\nFigure out, maybe the night before, the one thing that you want to get done in your day, and then at the earliest opportunity, just try to give yourself five minutes on it. Just five minutes. And the reason why I say five minutes is that there is this challenge that I experience and maybe other people experience as well, which is really just productive procrastination. Even though I know something is really important that needs to get done, I will often do other things that are useful and need to get done simply because I'm avoiding that one thing. And then before you know it's the end of the day and I'm like, \"I still have to go do that thing.\" By really focusing on what's the number one thing and then just getting started on it a little bit. It just makes it really lightweight. And usually, what I find is that five minutes turns into a solid hour just knocking that thing out early in my day, and I feel really accomplished. But it's a mental hurdle that I really struggle with.\n\nLenny (01:16:37):\nI really like the approach of the five minutes because that's such a trick to get you to like, \"All right, I'll just do five minutes. I got to get this done.\"\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:16:44):\nRight. It's quick.\n\nLenny",

There's a book that many people on this podcast have recommended called Make Time, and there's a framework within that called The Highlight, where you pick the highlight of your day, and that's the thing you got to do first and make... That's like, if you do nothing else, do your highlight and-\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:16:59):\nYeah, really similar then.\n\nLenny (01:17:01):\nYeah, and they don't do the five-minute thing, so I think that's a clever element of it. Ada, this was amazing. This chat was full of feelings, and frogs, and vegetables, and frameworks and insights. Thank you again so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:17:21):\nYou can find me online. On Twitter and LinkedIn, I'm Ada Chen, A-D-A-C-H-E-N. I have a website, adachen.com, and you can always just shoot me an email, adachen@gmail.com. In terms of how listeners can be useful to me, any feedback and riffs on some of the ideas and topics that we've shared. I'm always eager to learn from other people. So feel free to drop a note and say hello. And if you're a founder and you're interested in learning more about coaching, I'm always happy to talk.\n\nLenny (01:17:51):\nAwesome. And then Notejoy, how do they check that out?\n\nAda Chen Rekhi (01:17:54):\nNotejoy.com.\n\nLenny (01:17:56):\nSo easy. Great domain.

    "content": "Adam Fishman (00:00:00):\nOnboarding is the only part of your product experience that a hundred percent of people are ever going to touch. Good luck getting a hundred percent feature adoption of anything else in your product, right? But onboarding is the thing that you have to go through in order to use the product. It's also the first opportunity that you have as a company to deliver on the promise that you made out in the marketplace. So I like to think of your brand is the promise that you're making and your product experience is your delivery of that promise. And those two things have to be in lockstep with each other, or you're going to have mismatched expectations and some really disappointed customers. So this is the first chance that a customer has to be really excited or really disappointed in what they thought they were getting. So don't mess that up.\n\nLenny (00:00:55):\nAdam Fishman was the first growth and marketing hire at Lyft where he spent two and a half years leading their growth efforts. Then he went on to lead product and growth at Patreon, where he spent over four years building one of the most successful and lasting created platforms out there. And most recently, he was CPO at Imperfect Foods. Today he spends his time advising companies on product and growth, and he's also doing a lot more writing.\n\nLenny (00:01:19):\nAnd in this episode we cover three things, his growth competency model, which helps you hire and evaluate growth talent and also get a job as a growth person. We go deep into why onboarding is such an underappreciated growth lever and all of the impact that you can have optimizing your onboarding flow. Adam also shares a super cool framework for choosing which company to work at. Adam is hilarious and he's so full of wisdom and I can't wait for you to hear this episode. With that, I bring you Adam Fishman.\n\nLenny (00:01:50):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. Coda's an all-in one doc that combines the best of documents, spreadsheets, and apps in one place.

It's a pleasure to be on chatting with you today.\n\nLenny (00:04:36):\nIt's even more my pleasure. Thank you for being here.

I am blessed with great initials that allow me to have that name for a newsletter.\n\nLenny (00:05:47):\nIt's not obvious. Adam Fishman AF. There you go. That's the acronym. And then in terms of the advising, just to set this expectation, are you looking for more clients or are you capped out? How should people think about that as they listen?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:05:58):\nWell, I'm pretty busy, but it is a bit of a revolving door, so there's always some pipeline. So even if I can't work with folks right now, sometimes it makes sense for me to work with them a few months down the road. So always open to new interest and learning about new companies.\n\nLenny (00:06:12):\nAll right, great. We'll share how to contact you at the end of this and it will be in the show notes.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:06:15):\nAwesome.\n\nLenny (00:06:17):\nOne question I wanted to ask off the bat is, Lyft, you were there super early. I imagine it was an incredibly wild ride. I'm curious, what's the most tangible memory you have of your time at Lyft?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:06:29):\nI have a ton of memories from the almost three years that I was there, but I think the biggest one, and probably the most tactile or memorable thing was when we launched Lyft, when we were bringing it out of private beta, we had this press event at the office, which is in Soma, and it had these doors, these big huge garage style doors. And so we opened them up and we actually drove a car into the office with a pink mustache on the front of it, and then a bunch of drivers piled out of it and met the press members and were high fiving people and stuff like that. And then we also served a giant pink mustache cake at this event. So of all of the things there, that one sticks in my head the most.\n\nLenny (00:07:14):\nI love that. I hope there was no hair in this mustache cake.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:07:18):\nNo, no, there was not. It was delicious.\n\nLenny (00:07:21):\nOkay, awesome. Another question I always have for folks that worked at Lyft or at Uber is how they feel about Super Pumped and what it is like watching that, if you've seen it, what it's like watching the story of Uber and especially working for Lyft.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:07:35):\nYeah, I have seen it. I actually read the book first. I've been a pretty big fan of Mike Isaac, who's the New York Times reporter who wrote it. So I've been a big fan of his reporting for a long time. I connected with him a bit while he was writing the book, and I would say, there were parts of it that were painful. It was like renavigating, relitigating a history that I had lived through already. And so much of that story was stuff that I had experienced pretty regularly while I was at Lyft battling against Uber.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:08:04):\nSo one part of me was like, \"I remember that. God, that was hard.\" Another part of me was happy to see that all of the things were out in the open finally, things that were hard to talk about about competitive practices and stuff like that and just shady things. And some part of me was happy that it was out there. And then one other thing separately, so I actually was interviewing with Joseph Gordon-Levitt to be an advisor with his company HitRecord while he was filming Super Bumped.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:08:35):\nAnd we had this conversation over Zoom when he was on break in between scenes of filming the show. And for those who don't know, he's the guy that plays Travis Kalanick, the CEO and founder of Uber. So he did this interview with me and he was in his trailer on set, fully decked out as TK in his look with his hair slicked back. And it was really funny and also cool to see him in this context. And he is probably the polar opposite from Travis Kalanick. Obviously they're both super successful, but JGL is a really down to earth, nice, very family-oriented calm guy. So anyways, this is a funny story of my time meeting and interviewing with him.\n\nLenny (00:09:19):\nThat is amazing. Did you slip in a couple Lyft facts to help Lyft look a little happier and better?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:09:26):\nI did. We talked a bit about that journey and I asked him some questions about how he prepared for the role and stuff like that. And so yeah, it was pretty fun. We swapped some stories and stuff. So yeah, it was neat.\n\nLenny (00:09:37):",

Maybe I should have.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:09:54):\nIt didn't work out so well.\n\nLenny (00:09:56):\nYeah. Okay. So transitioning to the meat of our chat, there's three things I wanted to spend our time chatting about. One is your growth competency model, which essentially is this post you wrote recently that tells founders how to hire and how to evaluate growth people. Two, I want to chat about onboarding flows. You have a lot of really interesting experience optimizing onboarding flows and the impact that's had. And then three is how to choose a company to work out. You've chosen a lot of really interesting companies and you have some cool insights around how to think about that. Does that sound good?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:10:27):\nYeah, it sounds great. I've also chosen some bad companies in my time too, so we can talk about the good, the bad and the ugly.\n\nLenny (00:10:32):\nOkay, excited to hear about that. So first we talked about this briefly. You've started to do a lot more writing. You have this newsletter at fishmanafnewsletter.com, and you recently wrote this really epic piece called the Growth Competency Model, which essentially lays out what to look for in a growth leader, how to hire, how to evaluate, what to concentrate skills on? Things like that. First question, just what made you feel like you had to write this? What mistakes have you found founders make when hiring and evaluating growth leaders?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:10:59):\nYeah, so first I'm going to put up my new background here, which is my growth competency model background. For those watching on YouTube, I have a funny graphic in the background for this. So I guess the reason that I wrote this, there were a few reasons that I wrote it. One is it really felt necessary to write it. And at first it's, I don't think I've ever come across this type of canonical reference before around how to hire and plan for growth. So that's number one. I didn't think it existed. It needed to exist.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:11:32):\nTwo, as an advisor and someone who has held the head of growth role many times, I get asked this question a lot. I get asked all the time about how do you hire growth people? And it's usually something like, \"Hey, how do we find you but 10 years earlier in your career?\" And it feels like that question is missing the first principles approach to hiring a growth person. And if you're doing that, you're just pattern matching to me. And I may not be the best person, right, or somebody who looks like me may not be the best person. So I think we're missing that.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:12:09):\nAnd then third, one of the programs that I'm currently creating is around growth leadership. And so I've been thinking a lot about what it takes to be an exceptional growth leader, how you hire other people onto your team and create balanced teams. And this is going to be a really important component of that program. So it was just really top of mind. So yeah, that's why I wrote it.\n\nLenny (00:12:30):\nLet me ask one quick question and I think you were about to start answering one mistakes founders make, but I guess it's less of a question. I know this was built on another model for product management, which is really awesome. And I love that there's this growing fountain of career ladders, competencies per function. And so I don't know if there's been one that's really great for design and engineering, but I love that this is happening. And so first of all, I just want to say I appreciate that you put in the time to think this through.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:12:54):\nCool. Thank you. Yeah, and I do think we need more of these. I think we need one for marketers, I think we need one for engineers, designers, research probably, there's probably a bunch of functions that could benefit from some canonicalized resource around this stuff. So yeah, some myths and mistakes that I think founders made and that I've made. I've definitely lived through some mistakes. A few experiences where I was hired into a company where the founder had really messed up expectations of what a growth person should be doing, what I should be doing. And I wanted to set the record straight for founders because they are the folks who hire for this and other leaders.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:13:34):\nSo one example that comes to mind is, I did a very brief stint at a company called Wyzant, in between Lyft and Patreon. And the founders of that company, so Wyzant was a tutoring marketplace. It was acquired by a company not too long ago, so it's now part of a bigger learning company. And the founders of that company we're",

And the founders of that company, so Wyzant was a tutoring marketplace. It was acquired by a company not too long ago, so it's now part of a bigger learning company. And the founders of that company we're looking for what I would call a silver bullet strategy to their growth challenges. And what they really needed, and I was naive and didn't think about asking these questions or about evaluating this properly, what they really needed was to create a strategy to add on new growth loops and a system for how to execute against that strategy.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:14:13):\nIf we had talked about that as part of evaluating each other, as part of them evaluating me, it would've given me a lot of confidence that it was the right hire to make. But the problem was they didn't approach it that way. They didn't ask me those questions and I was too naive to recognize that, \"Hey, they're not actually evaluating this with the competencies that you would expect for a growth leader.\" Executing a growth strategy takes time and patience, and they didn't really have it. And overall it ended rather unsuccessfully. I helped them build this office in San Francisco, hired a bunch of folks, we actually closed down the office. I had to lay off a bunch of the people that I'd hired, including myself, which wasn't particularly fun. And I think all of it comes back to that they didn't have a really strong set of criteria on what it meant to hire a great growth person. And so if I can help even just a little bit with founders making that decision better, it'll lead to fewer mismatches I think in the hiring process.\n\nLenny (00:15:11):\nAwesome. Let's get into it. What are the components of this model? And you can put it back up again for folks to follow along in the background.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:15:18):\nIt's coming back.\n\nLenny (00:15:18):\nIt's like a TikTok.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:15:19):\nThe whole thing looks like a big circle and there's four wedges in that circle, four equal parts. And I think that answer of what are the components, what should people look for, really, I'll give the PM answer, which is it depends. And what does it depend on? It depends on the state of the team and where the skill gaps are. So the goal of the competency model is not to find a unicorn human being that is an 11 out of 10 on every one of these things, because frankly, that person doesn't exist. I am not an 11 out of 10 on these skills and I have been a growth executive at many companies. I consider myself to be pretty good at the job. The goal is to create a well-rounded team so that you're hiring and balancing skills across your team and that you don't have any gaps in your portfolio.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:16:06):\nAnd so when you think about it, there are four main components to the growth competency model. And the four big components or buckets are growth execution, customer knowledge, growth strategy, and then the last one is communication and influence. And each of those has three really specific skills. And so to give an example, let's break down growth execution for example, which is one of the very first ones that you should be good at if you're a growth practitioner. Within this competency grouping, there's three individual competencies that are channel fluency, experimentation, and what I'd call productizing learnings. And so you can evaluate and ask questions to understand how good people are at these different things and what their experience has been with them.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:16:54):\nSo in productizing learnings for example, one of the key things that a growth person has to do is generate hypotheses, learn from those hypotheses and then translate that into changes that they're making in the product. And you want to find somebody who has a track record of at least understanding how to take something they have learned that might be an experiment or something that's very NVP and turn that into something that has hooks into different areas of the product. And so that's a critical skill to evaluate. And one of an example, the overall set of competencies.\n\nLenny (00:17:26):\nTo throw in a question real quick, is one way to use this model, coming back to your Wyzant example where there's of course misalignment between you and the founder to sit down and look at this circle here and be like, \"Here's where I'm strong, here's where maybe we need to hire someone to take over.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:17:41):\nYeah, absolutely. You can almost use it as a reverse interviewing characteristic and say, \"What are the competencies you, founder, CEO, care about? What's really important to you for the first person in this role? Or the expectations that you have of what I will bring to the table.\" And then you can be really candid about what you're good at and what you're not good at, where you're developing. So yeah, I agree with that for sure.\n\nLenny (00:18:06):\nAwesome. I know this also plays into evaluating your performance and it could be like, \"Hey Adam, here's the three things that we want to focus on in the next cycle.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:18:13):\nFor sure. Yeah. It's really a good foundational framework for being really concrete and specific in the feedback that you provide someone. So rather than saying, \"Adam, you really need to be more strategic.\" Everybody's heard that at some point and",

Yeah. It's really a good foundational framework for being really concrete and specific in the feedback that you provide someone. So rather than saying, \"Adam, you really need to be more strategic.\" Everybody's heard that at some point and it's like, \"Well, what do you mean?\" You can say, \"Hey, we need to work on the area of growth strategy and that means I need to see better modeling of loops out of you, better understanding communication of what those loops are.\" And you can give really concrete feedback.\n\nLenny (00:18:44):\nAwesome. So we've talked about growth execution, What's next?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:18:47):\nThe next one is what I would call customer knowledge. And within customer knowledge there's a set of things and really this is about data fluency and instrumentation, understanding user psychology, which is a big one, and then this idea of being able to experiment and learn over time and how you develop your narrative and your creative approach to talking to customers. I love user psychology and it's one of the things that I think attracted me to growth and to product. I studied consumer psychology when I was in college and I'm just probably would've been a psychologist if not for a growth practitioner, which is a weird other approach I could have taken in my career. But-\n\nLenny (00:19:35):\nIt's not too late to pivot.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:19:37):\n... Second career. Yeah, actually, announcing today I'm pivoting the newsletter to just talk about therapy and psychology.\n\nLenny (00:19:43):\nYes. This is going to be the title of the podcast.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:19:47):\nAwesome. So like user psychology, I think one of the things that people don't easily understand is that most people come to your product with an emotional frame and a lot of people want to appeal to their logical brain right away. And the reality is, don't do that. And so you have to understand the mindset that people are in. How low are their lows? How high are their highs? Why are they seeking out your product? And it often, as I mentioned, stems from some emotional challenge that they're having or something that they're seeking. And it's not because your product is the best chat bot or because it gives the best answers. There's a different thing that they're trying to solve. And only when you address that can you move on to those other things. So that's the second competency is, customer knowledge.\n\nLenny (00:20:34):\nIt reminds me of something I mentioned on some podcast recently, this tweet that one of the Collison brothers tweeted about how user research is often misunderstood in that people think you do user research and that informs what you build. And instead the way you think about it is user research informs your model of your customer and that model informs what you build.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:20:56):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:20:56):\nAnd the more user research you do, the more your model evolves to help you understand the customer. And that's been really helpful for me because I never thought of it that way.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:21:04):\nYeah. I think that's a great example. Seeking the solution in a customer interview is never going to work, right? You seek to understand and then you take that away and you can think through what the model should look like and how things should change as a result. Yeah. That's great. I can cover the third and fourth competency-\n\nLenny (00:21:24):\nThat's good.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:21:25):\n... and I'll try to be a little more brief on that.\n\nLenny (00:21:27):\nNo, no. It's good.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:21:28):\nThe third competency is growth strategy. And now the third and fourth competencies I would say are a bit more advanced topics. And again, remember when I said people index higher or lower on these as they go across their career, I would expect a more junior growth person to not necessarily be a 10 out of 10 on strategy and communication. These are things that you really have to work at a long time. They tend to be softer skills in a lot of cases and you learn best by either getting it very right or getting it very wrong. And so you've got to put in the time to develop these. But in growth strategy, there's three. The first one is growth loop modeling. So really understanding how you grow and where you should be spending your time. What acquires users? What retains them? What monetizes them?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:22:18):\nThe second one is capital allocation and forecasting. This is basically where are you deploying either your money, your people, how are you managing the portfolio and how are you projecting that out into the future? And that's a really hard one. You have to become best buddies with your finance friends in order to do that. And so anyways, that's capital allocation and forecasting. And then the third one is prioritization and road mapping. So you have to be able to sequence the work much like in building a product, right? Building your growth strategy, you have to sequence it. That sequence has to make sense based on your growth models. You have to have the capital or the people to allocate to that stuff. And you have to be able to build a series of hypotheses in a series of solutions to test against those hypotheses so that you can learn and then productize to those learnings.\n\nAdam Fishman (00",

And you have to be able to build a series of hypotheses in a series of solutions to test against those hypotheses so that you can learn and then productize to those learnings.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:23:09):\nAnd there's a lot of ways to test this stuff. Situational, behavioral, interviewing, I talk a lot about this in my post on hiring growth. There's like very specific questions you can ask to understand what people have done or what they might do in different situations. There's case studies and things like that. So that's the third one. And then the fourth one is communication and influence.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:23:29):\nAnd I would say, I think you probably know this as a PM, influence is one of the biggest and hardest skills to develop. It's no different in a growth practitioner and in some cases it can even be harder because sometimes people come in with a preconceived notion of what growth is and isn't and you have to change their mind. And so within communication and influence, there's strategic communication. So how do a series of experiments and a series of things that you're trying, fit into the overall picture of a bigger bet that you're taking?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:24:06):\nHow do you lead a team? So team leadership is a big part of communication and influence. And then how do you manage stakeholders? And this is hard in growth because often growth can be viewed as at odds with really thoughtful and quality craftsmanship and product building, but it's not. Those things go hand in hand. And so you really have to win people over on what it means to do growth. And I would say, this is the pinnacle, right? This is the hardest one. It's a lifelong journey. It relies very extensively on understanding people and who you're talking to. And those people can be very different from company to company and the currency that they trade in can be really different. And so this one is one where you have to go back to square one and relearn who the people are that you're working with every time you step into a new role or a new company or get a new leader or something like that. So it can be really challenging and it's never done.\n\nLenny (00:25:03):\nThat component of the competency models, we're the PM of the growth PM role feels like if you were to do these Venn diagram of the two roles, feels like that's a big part of the overlap.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:25:13):\nYep, absolutely. There's a lot of overlap between exceptional product managers and exceptional growth practitioners. I think sometimes they just use the skills in different ways. So you need to be great at product strategy to be a product leader, you need to be great at growth strategy to be a growth leader. Just what those things look like can be different between the two. But they're both required skills, required competencies to be exceptional at the role.\n\nLenny (00:25:38):\nSo just to rehash, the four categories are communication influence, growth execution, customer knowledge and growth strategy. You mentioned earlier that people often come to you and they're like, \"How do we find another Adam?\" And your feedback is one, how do you know that's exactly what you need? And then two, find someone that's up and coming more because it's so hard to find folks like you that are actually ready to take on a head of growth role.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:26:03):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:26:03):\nSo a question for you is, one is, do you recommend founders focus on finding someone that's more up and coming and fast learning with a high trajectory? And if so, which of these components would you suggest they look for most?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:26:19):\nOne of the challenges of hiring a senior person is that they're all off writing newsletters and making podcast.\n\nLenny (00:26:25):\nRight.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:26:25):\nNot that we know anybody who does that or anything, but-\n\nLenny (00:26:28):\nNo. That's bullshit. What is that?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:26:29):\nYeah. So I don't want to right now go back and work at a company again. I'm enjoying what I'm doing and so it's hard to get me, right? But also you don't want me, I think, when you're doing this for the first time. So I think the key there is smart and driven people for sure. Age and youth is a bit relative I'd say. So I would think about hiring somebody who you might say is less experienced in growth, but they could be very senior in another aspect of their career. You can also benefit from hiring somebody internally who wants to branch out into growth. And one of the benefits that you get from that is a lot of time they have one of those competencies really nailed already. Could be like customer knowledge. They might understand your customer base super well because they're already inside the company.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:27:15):\nSo if you're going to hire a junior person, the key is, how do you help them learn? And I think if you don't know what you're doing as the founder or the leader, it's hard. You're not going to be able to help them yourself. So you've got to be willing to invest in advisors like me, outside education, mentorship, coaching, otherwise, what's going to happen is that very driven, hungry and enthusiastic person is going to run through a lot of brick walls, which is great, except they're going to",

And so I have some examples of both hiring people and moving people over in my career. So I think tangible examples are really helpful here. So when I was at Lyft, I had the privilege of hiring that young, smart and driven person a bunch of times, but one of the people who comes to mind is a guy named Ben Lauzier. You should have him on the podcast at some point. He's French, he's very nice to listen to you. He was most recently a VP of product at Thumbtack, but he was definitely not that when I hired him, he was a jack of all trades marketer working at a corporate catering startup when I hired him at Lyft. And he had nailed most of the growth execution and the customer knowledge competencies.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:28:38):\nOne was, he was an avid Lyft user himself, so he really understood the product really well. And also, he was just very thoughtful about how he executed, how he experimented. He had done a lot of it and he was very skilled at pulling them off in a very small environment because he had just had to be. And those are the two most important competencies when you're bringing in a younger, earlier stage person because teaching somebody how to execute is not that fun, right? That's a hard skill. The ability to execute is something like executive function skills and things like that. If you haven't developed those by the time you are an adult, I don't know that I'm going to be able to teach you and I'm certainly probably not the right person to teach you. You should definitely get some outside assistance with that. And so I like to get those types of people that have those things if I'm hiring that generally inexperienced growth practitioner.\n\nLenny (00:29:42):\nAnd the two things you said are customer knowledge and execution. Is that the two you said?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:29:46):\nYes. Customer knowledge and growth execution. And so let me tell you an execution story about Ben really quick. This comes also down to work ethic too. So we interviewed Ben and it was a long day of interviews in a tiny glass conference room and Lyft was, I don't know, 30 people or something at the time. At one of the interview breaks, Ben had come over and he didn't have his computer and anything like that. And so he was ducking out of work to do the interview. And he actually came out of the office and he's like, \"Hey, does anybody have a computer that I can borrow?\" And so we gave him this old crappy Chromebook and I was like, \"Why do you need a computer?\" And he's like, \"I have to go edit this file and do this thing and check something in at work and deploy this thing or whatever.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:30:32):\nAnd I'm like, \"Wow, this is a guy that really knows how to get stuff done and is so much so that he's pausing his interview process so that he could go get a thing done for his company that he's actively trying to leave, but he's got this work ethic and this execution.\" And that really stuck with me. And he probably would remember this story if we brought it up. So the time he borrowed a crappy Chromebook laptop to do work at the job that he was trying to leave.\n\nLenny (00:31:00):\nWhat are the chances that was staged?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:31:01):\nHe seemed very innocent. So I think not staged.\n\nLenny (00:31:06):\nOkay, great.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:31:06):\nBut I could be wrong. But now everyone that interviews that is going to ask to borrow a laptop and-\n\nLenny (00:31:10):\nThat's right.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:31:10):\n... check in some work.\n\nLenny (00:31:11):\nThe phone call.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:31:13):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:31:13):\n\"Adam, I need to fix something.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:31:15):\nThat's right. So that's Ben. And then on the other side, and I'll cover this one really quickly, and the other side of moving somebody over internally, I had equally great success with that. So there was another person named Sean at Patreon who was a marketer, again, a jack of all trades marketer. And I think I have a propensity and a bias towards folks like that because that's one of the ways that I started my career was in marketing. But anyways, I moved him over from marketing to being a growth PM, an entry level growth PM.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:31:47):\nAnd he had a ton of the execution skills, ability to prioritize really well and customer knowledge skills as well, more so on the customer side because he was an internal transfer, so he really knew our customers. He'd spent tons of time talking to people, studying data and things like that. And he had really great fluency with data and a drive to continue improving his ability",

He'd spent tons of time talking to people, studying data and things like that. And he had really great fluency with data and a drive to continue improving his ability to access and pull out insights and information. And so he turned out to be really great, but just a very different profile of a person than Ben was. And here's an internal hire versus an external hire.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:32:23):\nSo you can have success with both, but I think you really have to make sure that there's some foundational things that are in place like that ability to get customer knowledge and execute.\n\nLenny (00:32:34):\nIf a founder is listening and trying to decide or hiring a head of growth or a new growth person, would you push them one way or the other, internal hire versus finding someone up and coming and smart?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:32:44):\nI tend to skew more towards internal hire to be perfectly honest, because I believe in creating opportunity inside a company. I think it's not done often enough. And I also believe that helping people transition into new roles is a way to get more people into the practice. And one of the ways that can happen is if you take a chance on somebody who has demonstrated a good track record in some other aspect of your business. So I tend to recommend internal. I think you have faster time to results. I think you know what you're getting better and in much less likelihood of making the wrong hire there. So I bias towards internal hires.\n\nLenny (00:33:25):\nAwesome. And I think partly, I feel that too because there's so much content and training for growth these days that somebody has that background in your company and is already motivated and excited and then can just learn, go to Reforge course, read certain newsletters, feels like it's a lot easier to ramp up. Except, I always feel like if you need someone for SEO or paid growth, that's a hard thing to learn. What's your take there?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:33:51):\nI would bucket that type of person into a specialist. And one of the archetypes that I talk about is this idea of the painter versus the architect versus the surgeon. And the surgeon is your precision person. I don't actually recommend hiring that as your first hire, but when you are onto something and you really need expertise and you don't have that expertise internally, yes, I think hiring externally is the right thing to do at that point because those are really specific skills that some people have taken years to learn. And I can't just teach someone SEO over the course of a weekend and expect that they're really going to get it. In those cases, I think hiring that specialist or that surgeon is the right approach, once you've got some of the foundational stuff in place.\n\nLenny (00:34:41):\nAwesome. Great. Yeah, it feels like there's still a lot of dark art in those two specialties that take years of experience.\n\nLenny (00:34:49):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Tenfold and Cameo rely on Apple to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools, or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage.\n\nLenny (00:35:26):\nEppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead, you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, gete-p-p-o.com and 10x your experiment velocity.\n\nLenny (00:35:59):\nThis is a good time to segue to our second topic, which is onboarding. I know you're a big proponent of spending time on onboarding, optimizing onboarding. How have you found onboarding to be as a lever for growth and just what gets you excited about investing in onboarding?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:36:13):\nI love onboarding. I probably do at least an onboarding project to at least one with every company that I've worked for and a lot that I advise. The first thing I would say is, onboarding is the only part of your product experience that a hundred percent of people are ever going to touch. Good luck getting a hundred percent feature adoption of anything else in your product right? But onboarding is the thing that you have to go through in order to use the product. It's also the first opportunity that you have as a company to deliver on the promise that you made out in the marketplace.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:36:53):\nSo I like to think of your brand is the promise that you're making and your product experience is your delivery of that promise. And those two things have to be in lockstep with each other or you're going to have mismatched expectations and some really disappointed customers. So this is the first chance that a customer has to be really excited or really disappointed in what they thought they were",

And those two things have to be in lockstep with each other or you're going to have mismatched expectations and some really disappointed customers. So this is the first chance that a customer has to be really excited or really disappointed in what they thought they were getting. So don't mess that up.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:37:17):\nAnd the third thing I would say is it's also probably the most motivated that someone is going to be about your product since they're typically starting their onboarding journey with you at a time where they're like, \"I need this thing really badly that you're selling.\" And so they're really motivated, right? And so it's an opportunity for you to put some friction in place and learn a lot about them because they will knock down doors to get to your product. So that's why I think it's a super powerful lever for growth. And we worked on this extensively at Lyft, at Patreon, Wyzant, Imperfect Foods just released some onboarding improvements that we had created when I was there, which was nice to see that finally come to light. So yeah, I've done this pretty much everywhere at some point.\n\nLenny (00:38:07):\nWhat impact have you seen from working on onboarding to give people a sense of like, \"Wow, this is what I can get if I put some time here.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:38:15):\nYeah. One of the things that onboarding really drives is habit formation with the product, which leads to retention. And so you should expect to improve your overall cohort retention curves by focusing on the onboarding and activation experience. I have seen companies shift their curve outward by 10, 15, 20 percentage points from making those changes, especially when you consider that churn is most likely to happen in the very earliest usage of the product. If you can get people past that hump, it's a really invaluable part of the product to work on.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:38:51):\nSo I'll give you a really concrete example. At Patreon, one of the places we worked on onboarding really extensively and the onboarding experience was one of the teams that we had on growth at Patreon. We did a lot of experimentation around the earliest, what we would call product led sales now, when do you connect a human being with a creator and the onboarding experience and what is that impact and how do you connect them with the right person or with the right creator when there are tens of thousands going through that onboarding journey every week?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:39:25):\nWhat we realized through a lot of experimentation was the idea of connecting someone with a human being the right person at the right time would improve the first month of revenue or the second month of revenue that a creator made on the platform by 25%. Why that mattered is because the second month that you processed payments on the platform was a key input into your LTV on the platform. So by improving a creator's first and second month revenue by 25%, we were then able to improve their overall value on Patreon by an equivalent amount, which is pretty massive. Moving anything by 25% is really impressive.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:40:09):\nAnd so that was human intervention, and then we actually started to productize the stuff that the humans were doing. And so what is not scalable when you're using people becomes very scalable if you can replicate components of that with technology. And so that was the next phase, so we get back to that growth execution thing that I talked about and productizing learnings. That is an example of how you go from, we've learned some things by humans that have made a 25% impact to now we're building these into the product. And so that's a really good example I think, of Patreon and one of the impacts that we had on creator, earnings, retention and their overall success on the platform.\n\nLenny (00:40:50):\nThat's an amazing example, in case it's useful to a person working on the onboarding. Can you share any more about what you actually did there? You create some algorithm of this type of person, we'll connect them to a person and then you productize it. Is there anything more you could share there that might be useful to folks?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:41:06):\nGosh, we did so much. So I'll try to pull out a couple of example. So one of the things that we did, and again, I spoke to the fact that people are really motivated in your onboarding experience, one of the first things we did was we tried to identify better who a creator was in the onboarding experience. And who they were meant how big is their audience on a bunch of the channels where they managed communities, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Discord, YouTube, et cetera. And then how engaged was that audience? It's one thing if you make crazy cat videos on YouTube and you have a million subscribers, it's another thing if every time you publish a video, all million of those people watch it, comment on it, share it, et cetera.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:41:49):\nAnd so we would ask creators to connect various accounts to Patreon, maybe through authoring with YouTube or Spotify or Instagram or Facebook or something like that, Twitter, and then we would pull in the data into our backend and identify people who had large followings and also heavily engaged followings, based on a set of criteria per channel. And again, this was not just like me inventing this. We had a data scientist team that we worked very closely with to figure out what was important and what wasn't in this model. And then",

And again, this was not just like me inventing this. We had a data scientist team that we worked very closely with to figure out what was important and what wasn't in this model. And then if you were one of those people that had a high propensity for success, high potential creators, we would siphon them off from the regular self-guided onboarding and basically land them in the lap of a human being who could engage with them, reach out, get them even more excited and start talking to them about the best things to do.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:42:46):\nAnd then the productization of that, the best things to do turned out to be things like one of our product principles, which became opinionated defaults, which is basically making it hard to do the wrong thing when you're setting up your Patreon page and easy to do the right thing but not eliminating choice.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:43:07):\nSo the creator could still make the choice to do the wrong thing. They could still set up a single tier when we knew that a three-tiered pricing model actually would work better for them, or they could choose to set up 40 tiers when we knew that the sweet spot was three to five or perhaps make their lowest price tier a dollar instead of what we recommended, which was like three or $5 entry points. So they could do all that stuff, but we made it difficult for them to do it. We put more friction in place when they were trying to change some of those defaults because we had learned across a universe of creators, hundreds of thousands of people what worked best.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:43:52):\nAnd so putting in those guardrails and those default things was a huge lever for us to drive the behavior that we wanted. And again, we learned that from human intervention with the right types of creators, then detecting those people and putting in the guardrails in the product themselves and making those recommendations inside the product experience. And they were pricing tier structure, how you actually write your page, all of that stuff.\n\nLenny (00:44:18):\nSuch a great example. It reminds me we had exactly the same situation at Airbnb that you just made me think about. We called it smart defaults. What was your term? Opinionated defaults?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:44:29):\nOpinionated defaults. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:44:30):\nYeah, I like that. So at Airbnb we had a bunch of calendar settings when a host signs up, on the host side is where I spent a lot of my time, we had instant book, which is basically you sign up as a host and people can book you instantly. That became the default for Airbnb. And so to make that successful, hosts had to have their calendar be accurate from the beginning. And so what we got to eventually, is we tried to figure out, are you a professional host that knows what you're doing? Are you a mom and pop that's just trying this out? And then based on that, either block your entire calendar, keep it all open, or somewhere in between.\n\nLenny (00:45:03):\nAnd it's interesting that it connects to your point about, and I was going to come back to this that, a lot of people think of onboarding as a conversion opportunity and it definitely is. But to your point, even more interestingly, it's a retention opportunity because in the Airbnb case, hosts sign up, they get booked for a day, they don't want to host, they're like, \"Shit, what the hell's going on here? I'm out.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:45:22):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:45:22):\nAnd so, I wanted to ask you, how should folks think about onboarding conversion versus retention, and why is it so powerful for retention?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:45:32):\nI actually think if you're doing it right, sometimes conversion should actually decrease a little bit. So you might actually have fewer people getting all the way through successfully, but I think that's okay because a lot of those people were probably not the right people for your product, which means they wouldn't have been engaged customers, they probably would have churned. So just by the nature of actually weeding out some people, you're going to improve retention because the people who are going through are the people who are much more highly qualified. And so I think that's also why onboarding is so challenging because you have to figure out what that sweet spot is, right?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:46:17):\nYou could actually reduce conversion to a point where it's not offset by improvements in retention and you'd be doing the wrong thing. So when you're experimenting, you have to look at these push and pull metrics of these opposing metrics. But overall, I find that the biggest impact that you'll have is on retaining users because you are trying to connect them to the value that your product offers and form a habit. And if you form that habit early on, they're going to stick around because they're going to get it, they're going to get the benefit of the product, and they're going to be excited to stay and then tell more people about it. So that's why I think it's a much bigger impact on retention than conversion.\n\nLenny (00:47:01):\nObviously retention is a longer tail metric and conversion is immediate.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:47:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:47:07):\nDo you have any tips for folks that are like, \"Oh my God, how do I",

I think the answer is not wait 90 days to find out, right? Nobody has that time. And so what I tend to do is look at proxy metrics. So there are proxies for things like 90 day retention. As an example at Patreon, one of our proxies around the eventual success of a creator was how quickly they would reach certain dollar thresholds once they launched. And so your velocity to get to your first patron, your first a hundred dollars processed on the platform and that thing had a lot to do with how big and successful you would be, and therefore how well you would retain.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:47:52):\nAnd so we looked at very early signals to understand and evaluate how good someone was going to be. We also did a lot of qualitative screening in the beginning. So as people went through, we would take samplings of creators who were onboarding and signing up and launching their pages, and we would actually look at who the creator was and what they were doing. And then we would be able to run it through our model to say, \"It looks like we're getting a lot of the right people going through and doing the right behaviors, therefore, we're very confident that they're going to retain better and do the right things.\" So yeah, proxy metrics are the key there.\n\nLenny (00:48:32):\nAwesome. So part of this is find this leading indicator proxy metric, and then to your point, maybe build a little bit of a heuristic that's like, okay, this is qualitatively looking like it's doing the right things to our new users.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:48:45):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:48:46):\nMaybe our last question on onboarding is, at Airbnb and I imagine many companies, there's this constant desire to, \"Let's just redo this whole thing. Let's just redesign it. Let's start again.\" And my question to you is just, how much is too much on redoing, rethinking, onboarding, optimizing, micro-optimizing? Any answers there?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:49:05):\nYeah. I would say first, I very strongly dislike the idea of redesigning something for redesigning sake. So I think that it is true that you should spend a lot of time on onboarding, and you should regularly revisit it as you learn new things about your users. So even at Patreon, we would work on onboarding and then we take a beat, we'd let it go for a while, improved, and then as we learn new things, we would find ways to fold those back into onboarding. So I find that it's acceptable to revisit when you are learning net new principles about your customers or something new about your growth model where onboarding can directly influence.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:49:51):\nSo as we learned at Patreon what the right tier construction was, or the right way to talk about your Patreon page or the right way to message it in the beginning, we would go back and say, \"How do we build this newfound knowledge into an experience that sets someone up for success?\" But if we weren't gaining new insights, we weren't just tweaking the onboarding experience and trying to tune it in a very micro way, because the reality is, that doesn't really move the needle that often, especially once you've got it in a pretty good foundational place. And only when you discover something really fundamentally net new, will it have an outsized impact on retention or the success of early users. So don't just redesign for redesign sake, make sure there's a new hard earned insight that you've got before you do it.\n\nLenny (00:50:50):\nDo you think at scale companies, I don't know, maybe after hundreds of people, they should have a team, like an onboarding optimization team? I find that often is true. And I guess, do you think that makes sense?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:51:03):\nYeah. I think it's very helpful. And the reason I think it's helpful is because I do think it's easy to walk away from onboarding because there's so many other things to work on and to lose sight of the fact this is such a critical part of the experience. And I don't know how many times I've come into a company and they're like, \"Yeah, we built that a long time ago and we've never looked at it again. It's been a few years, but we're really having a real problem with retention and people dropping off in the first seven days.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, I think it's time we take another look at the onboarding experience. Products change quite a bit. Maybe people are getting something that's different than they expect, or maybe we know a lot more that we can use to influence decisions that they make.\"\n\nAdam Fishman (00:51:50):\nSo I do think it is beneficial to have that team, or at least a team, that part of their job is the activation experience and therefore some part of their roadmap is working on onboarding and then other aspects of activation. So it may not be what they work on 12 months out of the year, but maybe for a quarter or two in a given year.\n\nLenny (00:52:13):\nCool. And there's a LinkedIn post you wrote with a bunch of examples of onboarding work you've done.",

And there's a LinkedIn post you wrote with a bunch of examples of onboarding work you've done. So we're going to include them in the show notes for folks that are-\n\nAdam Fishman (00:52:20):\nNice.\n\nLenny (00:52:20):\n... hoping for more examples. Yeah. Okay. Third topic, final topic is around company selection and evaluating where to work. And you have this really cool framework that I think you call PMF for candidates. Can you talk about what that is and then we'll get into it a little bit?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:52:34):\nYeah. I somehow stumbled on that name and it just made sense because of the acronym. But I think I was really motivated to revisit this because as we know in tech there's been a ton of layoffs and very public layoffs because of the economy, the state of funding, things like that. And I don't think we're done yet. I think we're pretty far from being done. But it's really important, and I've been burned by this a few times, to put some power back in the hands of the people who are actually seeking the jobs to understand what are some criteria that are important and these are the criteria that are important to me that help you make decisions about which company I should join, assuming they'll have me. And so the PMF acronym, and we're all familiar with product-market fit, right?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:53:23):\nSo in a way it's both the product-market fit for as a candidate with the company, but then also PMF stands for people, mission and financials. And these are my three criteria. They may not be yours, Lenny, or they might not be the average person on the street, but the point is that you should have a set of criteria that you are unapologetically rigorous around and you should learn how to evaluate companies against that set of criteria. First, I guess I'll tell you what by people, mission and financials.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:53:56):\nSo people are these folks that I am going to enjoy working with everyday that I'm going to be able to have hard conversations with, that I'm going to be able to disagree with and work through those disagreements and feel better on the other side of that productive disagreement, for example, and get to resolutions. What do I think about my peer set, the leaders, the people below me, if that's the role I'm stepping into, et cetera. So that's the people dimension.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:54:30):\nMission, which is critically important for me, is that if I join a company and I do my job, which often involves growing that company really big, getting a lot of customers, generating a lot of demand and retention and stuff, I want to make sure that a lot of people have a better outcome in life because of that company's existence. And I don't just mean employees and founders having a good financial outcome, which I think is important. But I also mean in the case of creators on Patreon, we were building a new way for creators to make money, which they could then use to hire people, create more jobs, make better content, and live their life in a sustainable way so that they weren't a starving artist and they weren't living paycheck to paycheck. So that's really important, the mission aspect, that's got to exist.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:55:19):\nAnd then the third one is, and I think really important now is this idea of financials or fiscal discipline. You've got a lot of companies who raised boatloads of money or did financial planning during the peak of the pandemic and assumed that their business was going to continue operating at the pace that it was operating forever. A lot of those companies are running out of money, they've seen a hit to demand and they've had to lay people off as a result or make really big strategic swings.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:55:53):\nThere are plenty of companies that you're not really hearing about that were more conservative in their approach, that understood and were able to look into the future and be really responsible with their money. And those people are not laying off employees. And so they're not all over LinkedIn talking about it because they're not laying people off. There's no hashtag layoff for them. So that's what by financials. And so that's the PMF framework and evaluating across those dimensions is super important. I've done it two times in the last 10 to 15 years, and I've done it poorly, two times in the last 15 years. And Lyft and Patreon are two times where I've done it really well. Wyzant and Imperfect Foods are two times where I personally don't think I've done a good enough job evaluating.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:56:41):\nAny time where I've shortcutted my criteria, where I've settled for two out of three, or thought one was great, when really it wasn't, has not ended well for me, for the company, it's not that the company imploded, but I found myself out of a job or really frustrated and burned out or something like that. I already talked about the Wyzant example where we had to lay off a bunch of people because the founders expected something very different than what I expected to be able to deliver, that's a big people miss. And Imperfect Foods was somewhat similar, amazing mission, really great financial strategy, fantastic CFO, but a lot of infighting at the C-suite.",

I already talked about the Wyzant example where we had to lay off a bunch of people because the founders expected something very different than what I expected to be able to deliver, that's a big people miss. And Imperfect Foods was somewhat similar, amazing mission, really great financial strategy, fantastic CFO, but a lot of infighting at the C-suite. And it made it really difficult for us to plan and move the company forward together because people were at odds with each other all the time and not resolving disagreements productively. And when that happens, it's hard to be a product or a growth leader because you bear the brunt of the angst that people have. So anyway, so those are a couple examples and some of the characteristics of PMF.\n\nLenny (00:57:57):\nIn the case of Imperfect Foods, what could you have done to have avoided that issue and seen if it was true PMF?\n\nAdam Fishman (00:58:04):\nI would have tried to observe the inner workings of the C-Suite a little bit more closely before I accepted an offer to join the company. I would've attended an executive meeting or joined them on an offsite. And I think, too often, candidates don't feel like they can ask for those things. And it's true, if you're entering the C-suite, you're going to ask for more stuff, you're more experienced. But I also think that's true of a junior employee. You can observe a team meeting, you can observe a product review and understand, you sign an NDA, you promise you won't tell anybody about it, but observe what is happening and the dynamics of that room. Who's doing the talking? How feedback is delivered, is it constructive? Is it antagonistic, et cetera. So you can observe and then you can also ask questions.\n\nAdam Fishman (00:59:00):\nSo questions that I like to ask are, tell me about the last strategic offsite that you had as a leadership team. Where do people disagree? What was one thing that they disagreed on and where did you end up on that point and how did you get there? And I actually ask them to tell me, it's like a reverse behavioral interview question. I ask them to tell me how they navigated it, and I will ask the CEO that and really dig in on that particular set of questions. Those are the things that I do to evaluate the people dimension, which is one of the hardest, I will say. Financials and mission a little easier to evaluate, but people really require getting to know teams. So it is hard.\n\nLenny (00:59:43):\nThat's such a good question to ask. And your point is you can ask that even if you're not a senior leader, you're just ICPM joining a team. Is there anything else you think folks can do? So you said, join some offsites maybe, ask this question that you shared, any other tips for folks just to understand if the people are a good fit? Because it's pretty wild. You're going to spend so much time with these people and you meet them once in a half hour interview and then you have to decide if that's your life for the next four or five, 10 years.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:00:09):\nWell, one thing that I would say is, you're an investor, right? You invest in a lot of companies, you're an angel investor and you have the Airbnb syndicate and things like that. You evaluate companies when you're making an investment decision, right? Because you're investing a sum of money into that company. And so as a result, you do a lot of diligence on companies or read other people's diligence, something like that. When you're interviewing at a company, you are actually investing an even more scarce resource. You're investing your time. There is no way to get more time. We're all on a finite clock. You can always get more money. If you make a bad investment decision, \"Okay, we lost there.\" Provided you didn't bankrupt yourself. Even if you did, you can climb out of bankruptcy. There are things that you can do, but time is fleeting.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:00:56):\nAnd so one of the other things, and this is a thing that you do when you're an investor, is you do back channel references, right? A company is going to back channel, you the employee, if they're a good company, they're going to talk, if you and I had worked together, Lenny, they might say, \"Hey, let me get in touch with Lenny and see what it was really like working with Adam instead of what Adam tells me in the interview process.\" And you're going to do this as an investor in a company. \"Let me talk to some people who passed on investing in this company. What did they see that I don't see?\"\n\nAdam Fishman (01:01:29):\nAnd so in this case, you can talk to current or former employees who are not on the interview circuit. And because they are not on the interview circuit, their role as a salesperson in the process is greatly diminished. And they can, especially if they're not at the company anymore, give you some pretty candid feedback on what it's like to work there. So I'll give you a really good example. That was super impressive. A PM who worked for me at Patreon, who you know Tal Raviv-\n\nLenny (01:02:00):\nShout out Tal.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:02:01):\nShout out to Tal, who works on this product that we're recording on right now-\n\nLenny (01:02:06):\nShout out Riverside.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:02:08",

That was the first time that had actually ever happened in my career. And I was happy to share that with him. And it represented to me a great level of thoughtfulness and insight around him evaluating what he was getting himself into. And he was an ICPM and he asked that of me, who was a VP executive level person at the company.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:02:44):\nSo you can do that. And if a company says no or a person says no, I think that actually says a bit more about them than anything else. If they're trying to withhold that from you. Because why would you? If I'm a great manager, I'm happy to have you talk to people who I've managed before, even people maybe who I had to let go or something like that, right? I'm confident that those were the right decisions and that those people ended up in a better place and they were taken care of with great care. I would actually make a reference of somebody who I have let go before just so that someone could get a real honest truth of what it was like working with me. So anyways, that's my take on PMF and questions to ask.\n\nLenny (01:03:30):\nI imagine you have PMF with your current world, so maybe just to close, can you just remind folks what you're up to now and where they can find you online and also how listeners can be useful to you?\n\nAdam Fishman (01:03:42):\nFirst, thanks for having me on, Lenny. This was super fun. I love talking about this stuff and it was great chatting with you. So thanks again for having me.\n\nLenny (01:03:50):\nMy pleasure.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:03:51):\nThere are a few ways to get in touch with me. You can follow me and communicate with me on Twitter. My Twitter handle is Fishman, F-I-S-H-M-A-N AF. And I do respond to messages provided that they're polite. And you can also find me on LinkedIn. Those are the two platforms I live on most frequently, for better or for worse. And then I now have this newsletter, fishmanafnewsletter.com. And a lot of what we talked about today are things that I am publishing in written form on that newsletter and plan to continue publishing going forward. And again, it was inspired by the work that you're doing, Lenny.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:04:29):\nSo how can people be helpful to me? I think certainly subscribing to the newsletter and joining that community, telling me about the things that are challenging to them so that I can find ways of finding how they meet up with my interests and translating them into written pieces. And then if you're ever interested in exploring an advisory relationship with me or learning more what that looks like, reach out. I'd love to meet you. Advisory work is what pays the bills right now, and my kids need to eat. I probably need to eat a little less, but my kids need to eat. So reach out about an advisory relationship if you're looking for some help on growth or product or general company building. It's what I do.\n\nLenny (01:05:08):\nAdam, you're so full of insights and lessons, and I'm so happy that you've started writing and sharing a lot of these things. Folks should definitely subscribe. Fishmanafnewsletter.com. Adam, thank you for being here.\n\nAdam Fishman (01:05:18):\nYeah, thanks a lot, Lenny. This was awesome.\n\nLenny (01:05:21):\nThank you so much for listening.

This is a rare two-guest episode. Melissa and Denise are authors of an awesome new book called Product Operations: How Successful Companies Build Better Products at Scale. Melissa is a legend in the product management community. She's the author of the foundational handbook, Escaping the Build Trap. She runs a product management training organization called Produx Labs, teaches product management at Harvard, and has worked with hundreds of companies on their product management function. Denise is a product leader, coach, and consultant helping companies with their product vision, strategy, and execution, and works with Melissa at Produx Labs. \n\n(00:01:02):\nIn our conversation, we get super deep into the emerging role of product ops. As you'll hear in our conversation, over the past few years, this role has gone from almost non-existent to something like half of scaling tech companies with at least one product ops person. This new role is probably the thing that's most changing in the role of product management. After this conversation, I'm convinced it's a great thing. \n\n(00:01:24):\nWe chat about what the role concretely is, how it differs from product management and project management, what to look for in your first product ops hire, how to roll out a product ops function, why product managers shouldn't be afraid of this role and how your life gets significantly better, plus, a case study on how they rolled out product ops function at a large company, and so much more. With that, I bring you Melissa Perri and Denise Tilles after a short word from our sponsor.\n\n(00:01:50):\nYou fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers, and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates and you're spending your days basically putting out fires. A better way is possible. Introducing Jira Product Discovery, the new prioritization and road mapping tool built for product teams by Atlassian. With Jira Product Discovery, you can gather all your product ideas and insights in one place and prioritize confidently, finally replacing those endless spreadsheets. Create and share custom product roadmaps with any stakeholder in seconds, and it's all built on Jira, where your engineering team's already working so true collaboration is finally possible. \n\n(00:02:36):\nGreat products are built by great teams, not just engineers, sales, support, leadership, even Greg from finance. Anyone that you want can contribute ideas, feedback, and insights in Jira Product Discovery for free, no catch, and it's only $10 a month for you.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nDenise Tilles (00:03:17):\nThank you. \n\nMelissa Perri (00:03:18):\nThanks for having us.\n\nLenny (00:03:19):\nYou are the second ever guest duo I've had on the podcast. Melissa, this is your second appearance on the podcast, and you two have a new book out, which I have right here. It's called Product Operations: How Successful Companies Build Better Products at Scale. What I want to do with our time today is to help people fully understand the role of product operations from every direction as much as we can get through in an hour. How does that sound?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:03:44):\nSounds great. \n\nDenise Tilles (00:03:44):\nGreat.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:03:45):\nLet's do it. \n\nLenny (00:03:45):\nAwesome. So first question, just to set a little context on this role, how popular and how common is the role at this point? I did a quick skim of just awesome companies and really successful companies, and every single one of them seems to have a product ops role at this point. OpenAI, Uber, Stripe, Ramp, Deal, those are just the few that I looked at. Is that what you're seeing? How should people think about how popular and how common this role has become?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:04:12):\nI think over the last few years, we definitely have seen product operations start booming. It did originate in a lot of big companies that you mentioned too like Uber. The head of product operations at Uber and the person who started it, Blake Samic, is a case study in our book and he also did it at Stripe and he does it at OpenAI. So it's pretty funny that you mentioned those three because that's Blake right there who did that. We have seen a very good transition from people whispering about product operations, and I know when I wrote my first book, Escaping the Build Trap, in 2018 I mentioned it in there because we had just started doing it at Athenahealth. \n\n(00:04:49):\nI saw this as a really big issue in trying to make a complete product management function there and especially at scale. We had 365 product teams. We were trying to figure out how does this all come together",

We had 365 product teams. We were trying to figure out how does this all come together, and product operations for me was a key part of it. So when I had first written it into that book, a lot of people were like, \"Oh, what is this thing? I think we need it. Do we need more?\" and that's what got us to start writing this book. Since then, I've seen a lot more companies coming out and either making more mature product operations teams that started probably before that or actually introducing them now.\n\nLenny (00:05:21):\nI guess maybe thinking about just tech companies, if you had to put a number on some rough percentage of interesting fast-growing, hyper growth, these startups, is there a percentage you'd put on how many of them have a product ops person at this point?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:05:34):\nWe don't have a hard and fast number, I'll say that on this, but we have seen that. Let's take a sampling of maybe something that I know better. When I teach CPO accelerator, when I teach people in these cohorts, out of the 20, 25 people that we'll have in a cohort, I'd say at least half of them have somebody doing something product ops related. It might not be a mature function, it might just be one person on it, but at least half of them have somebody doing something.\n\nDenise Tilles (00:06:06):\nThat's a good yardstick because I teach a product operations masterclass for Produx Labs with Melissa, and it's been interesting. I do some pre-work and try to understand where folks are in the products journey. When we started offering this class in 2020, about 60% were products curious. As time has gone on, it's really gone down and people have started to add it. They just want to understand what's the best way to optimize it. So I would say it's gone from that level to, say, probably 60% of them do have it now and then want to understand how to optimize it.\n\nLenny (00:06:41):\nDo you have a sense of when this started to inflect and become such a common thing? When I was a product manager, I had no product ops person. So it's really fascinating to me to learn about this emergence. I know there's probably not a date, but just it sounds like maybe after your last book was published. Is there a timeframe of this became a thing? Is it this guy you mentioned that's now at OpenAI that started spreading it? \n\nMelissa Perri (00:07:01):\nBlake, I think, was one of the people at the beginning who was talking about it the most and he's done a lot of work, I think, to push product operations and tell people about it. So that was great. I know Pendo has been speaking about product ops a little bit more and that's where I started to notice that it was picking up steam. I think around 2019 is when Pendo started talking about product operations. So it was roughly right after my book came out that I saw more people speaking about it and now they're trying to figure out, \"Do we standardize it? What do we need? How does this actually look like in organizations?\" but I think it's been probably a good five years of now hearing people doing it in realtime.\n\nLenny (00:07:41):\nAwesome, and it sounds like maybe just in the last few years it started to really take off. We actually had Christine from Pendo on the podcast talking about product ops about a year ago at this point. So this is a great followup to a lot of that. Before we talk about what is product ops and what are the functions, what would you say are the biggest benefits to a company having a product ops role and also just what's a sign that you should probably seriously consider bringing on a product ops person and starting to invest in that area?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:08:08):\nIt's really about helping the product managers focus on what they were actually hired for, the strategic work. In my role on the operating side and managing teams and Melissa as well, more and more product managers are taking on the data, harvesting the data, implementation and just to get data to work with, they're spending 20%, 30% of their time. So what would that look like if they were enabled and had all of those great inputs to actually focus on company growth, achieving the value, achieving the scaling goals that the company had? So it's really about helping them focus on what they were hired for.\n\nLenny (00:08:48):\nAgain, when I was a PM, I had no product ops person, and having read your book, basically all the things product ops does is stuff PMs historically have done. To me, it's scary to give up all those things and put them on someone else's plate. There's the ideal of, \"Oh, amazing, I don't have to do all these things. I'll focus on things I really get excited about,\" but there's also this new fear of, \"Oh, someone else is going to take these things and maybe they won't do as well. There's this new process I have to think about. There's new lines of communication.\" So what's your biggest pitch to a product manager starting to hear about product ops and this fear of like, \"Oh, man, my job is going to be weird. This new person",

There's this new process I have to think about. There's new lines of communication.\" So what's your biggest pitch to a product manager starting to hear about product ops and this fear of like, \"Oh, man, my job is going to be weird. This new person I have to deal with all the time. I used to do all these things.\" How do you help a PM get excited about this?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:09:30):\nProduct operations does not take away decision making rights from the product manager. It's there to inform them. So if you're judging your success as a product manager of, \"Hey, I do the SQL queries and I have to spend the 50 hours to set up all these customer interviews and calls,\" that to me is very operational process type work, but it's not work that's going to help you make a decision about your product. That's why we're looking at the product operations team because what I've seen is product managers doing this off the side of their desk like me too. I got excited about this because when I was at OpenSky in early days of my product management career, I had to go learn MongoDB to get data out of a database. I was sitting through a MongoDB class learning how to do this. I knew SQL, but we did not use the SQL database then. I had to go learn MongoDB so I would stop bothering the engineers to be able to actually just measure if my products and my features were doing anything correct. \n\n(00:10:27):\nThat was a lot of time that I spent doing that instead of spending it on good feature work and on understanding my customers and working with my developers and figuring out what we were actually going to build, instead I'm out here learning this programming language, which I never used again, by the way. Never used it again after that. That to me is the stuff that product ops takes away from the product managers. \n\n(00:10:51):\nWhat I constantly hear from product managers though is, \"I am so busy, I don't have time to do the things that I need to do correctly. I'm so busy trying to line up customer interviews,\" or, \"I'm so busy just trying to get data out of systems. I'm fighting these fights to get the things that I need to do my job correctly that I don't have time to do my job correctly,\" and that's what we're trying to help them with. So I wouldn't be afraid that product ops is coming in here. It's not supposed to be something that's providing more overhead. It's supposed to be something that's a little more liberating and helps free you up from all the busy work.\n\nLenny (00:11:26):\nThat's a great pitch. I always thought product management is an insane role with way too much going on, and that's why everyone's always burnt out and stressed. There's just so many things you have to do. So I totally get how this is happening and why this is happening. I love that you're helping people figure out how to actually do it well. Let's actually get into what the role actually is. I think it's a really confusing role. A lot of people hear product ops and everyone know what it is. There's maybe research synthesis, there's some data stuff. What's the simplest way to think about what is the general consistent roles of a product ops person and what they can do for your company?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:12:03):\nThe way we think about it is structured around the three pillars that we talk about in the book, so business and data insights, more of the quantitative side, making sure that the product manager has all of these engagement and revenue inputs to make smart decisions, the customer market insights, so the qualitative. We talked about this a little bit earlier in terms of finding folks to speak to, making sure you're speaking to more than one just customer. Finally, the third pillar is process and practices. So it's really around those areas and it depends on what your company needs and where the biggest opportunities and challenges might be.\n\nLenny (00:12:43):\nAwesome. So the three, just to reshare what you just said, the three pillars of product ops, business, data and insights, customer and market insights and the process of how you build product and helping the business operate more effectively in the way they build product.\n\nDenise Tilles (00:13:00):\nSounds great when you say it. Yes.\n\nLenny (00:13:03):\nI have the notes and this is exactly described in your book, so well-described. Is there one of these three that you find most important, impactful? Is it really dependent on the business and their needs or what the PM wants to do? How do you think about, I don't know, which of these three is maybe most important or is it a super dependent?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:13:20):\nSo we usually see that high growth companies start with business data and insights and make sure that they can actually monitor what they're doing and get the strategic inputs. We see larger companies and enterprises go more towards the process and governance, especially if they're in, let's say, a transformation because they don't have the infrastructure to run good product. Let's say it's that way. They're usually just starting out, they're just forming their teams. Let's say they just trained product managers and now they're like, \"What else do we need to do besides just training product managers to make this work?\" So they need an operating model and they typically don't have a product operating model. \n\n(00:13:58):\nIn that case, they're looking at even just, \"How do we do roadmaps across the organization so",

You need a portfolio tool to be able to roll that up into something that makes sense. Again, that helps me as a VP now or a CPO make strategic decisions and it helps me monitor my teams and understand, \"Are we actually spending money on the right things? Are we doing the right work?\" So they tend to do it more on the process and governance side, but it's all in service of being able to make rapid strategic decisions and get good products out there to the world.\n\nLenny (00:14:40):\nThat's a really handy way of thinking about it. So just to say what you said again, for high growth companies, you're finding of these three pillars generally where product ops can help most is the business and data insights, helping them understand what's happening and make decisions more quickly, which makes a lot of sense. For more established older companies going through a digital transformation, oftentimes it's helping them with their process and making them more efficient in how they operate. Is there also a bucket for the middle pillar of customer and market insights or is that spread across?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:15:11):\nThat's the squishy middle. When I do teach this class, I ask people what their perception is of product ops and people never think that. So that's an area definitely for growth I think at a lot of companies.\n\nLenny (00:15:26):\nHow does that piece work with user research and that team?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:15:30):\nSo we've seen a lot of the work that is done in that team. They work with user research. Now, in organizations where let's say, this happens in a lot of organizations but not all of them, where product oversees design as well and user research and it oversees UX, this becomes seamless because you are going to have, let's say, a product ops person usually with a user research background who's going to be helping to do the stuff we talk about and the customer market insights piece, which is pulling all the research that's been done, like the customer interviews, all those things together into things like a findings database. So there's great tools out there like Dovetail, but you can also roll your own, and it's about aggregating all the interviews or customer research that's been done so people can query it and start to see what do we already know so we're not going out there and duplicating a bunch of research.\n\n(00:16:22):\nIt's also about finding participants who want to opt into research. So making sure that you have customers aware that, \"Hey, we might contact you to do customer interviews. This is why. Do you want to participate in alphas and betas? If so, this is what it entails.\" If we can build a database of people and customers that we have who opt into those types of things, it makes it easier for product managers to go out and contact them and say, \"Hey, by the way, we got a beta. Do you want to do it?\" They know what it is, they're expecting it. They know what the cadence is that people will reach out to them on to do research, and the user researchers can use that as well. \n\n(00:16:58):\nNow, the thing about the customer and market insights piece is that that person who's streamlining those activities and building those systems, they're not usually the same person who's doing the user research. So this is not about taking user research away from product managers or from user researchers, it's about enabling them to do it more effectively, enabling the insights to be put out across the company more effectively, and also helping them get in touch with users and get that feedback. \n\n(00:17:30):\nAnother piece of this too that we talk about is getting qualitative insights from sales and support. So we always hear from sales teams, and this is the classic product management tension, \"The product managers aren't listening to me\" or, \"I've told them five months ago that I had this problem with these customers that were going to churn.\" We didn't build those features. What this function does with the customer and market insights here is that it helps get a lot of that information back to the product team in an effective way. \n\n(00:18:00):\nThen it also helps communicate back to sales, \"Hey, let's be a little transparent about how we're using that feedback.\" So that's how we can communicate it back in strategy. Let them know where we stand with working on those ideas or solving those problems for customers, but usually, there's a wealth of qualitative information stuck somewhere in our organization systems, whether it's in Salesforce, whether it's in support tickets, in somebody's Google doc of their customer interviews that they've been doing, and what we're trying to do is get that out of these individual systems and into somewhere where a lot of people can take those qualitative insights and start to learn from them.\n\nLenny (00:18:36):\nPeople always ask me, \"What's changing in product management? What's the future of product management?\" I'm always like, \"Nothing. It's going to be basically the same. It's just never going to be fully defined. It's going to keep doing this weird role,\" but I feel like this is actually the answer. What's changing",

What's the future of product management?\" I'm always like, \"Nothing. It's going to be basically the same. It's just never going to be fully defined. It's going to keep doing this weird role,\" but I feel like this is actually the answer. What's changing in product management is this product ops role is emerging, taking a lot of these things that PMs don't necessarily want to be doing or aren't amazing at and giving you more space to do the things they really want to do. So I think that's pretty amazing. I think if you think about the timeline, you said five years ago there was no real product ops. Today, half of companies essentially have a product ops role and I'm guessing in another few years it'll be much higher. So this is really interesting.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:19:12):\nI'm excited about it too. I think what we saw before was that, like you were saying, product management was this squishy role for a long time, but now we're standardizing what do product managers do. What's happening, I think, though is product managers become more prevalent, and as people realize that this is a critical role for companies, whether you're a software company or a bank or something else. We build businesses off of software in today's world and if you're not building software, you are behind. With more and more software that we're putting out there, product managers don't have time to go do all these things off the side of their desk and it's fine when you're a small startup. I was doing it too. Like I said, I had to go learn MongoDB when I was in a smaller company, and then we start to scale and I've got more and more product responsibility and I'm like, \"I don't have time to go learn MongoDB now,\" and that's where people start to burn out and where they get frustrated, like you said.\n\n(00:20:09):\nWe've got more and more systems, we've got more software tools out there that product managers are using, and it becomes a lot to track. So it's either, for companies, do you want to hire 10,000 product managers and let them all do these things off the side of their desk and then concentrate on strategic work 30% of the time or do you want them concentrating on strategic work majority of the time and then help build a product operations team around them that can create these shared systems and this infrastructure to allow them to work better?\n\nLenny (00:20:39):\nI think that's such a powerful way of thinking about this. I imagine PMs listening to you saying, \"I don't have to learn MongoDB and SQL anymore,\" would think. Actually, no, I think that's good. They should learn to do SQL and run their own data, but I think the important pieces here, yes, it would be great, but as you scale, it becomes harder and harder to have time to do all that because things ... You end up with other work that you need to be doing. So in theory, it would be awesome if your PMs could run their own queries and do their own research and create the whole process, but it just becomes harder and harder. \n\n(00:21:12):\nIt reminds me of a lot of companies that are trying to delay hiring a product manager in general and instead giving the role to engineers and designers. My feedback is always like, \"That's great as long as they want to be doing all these things that are not generally what they enjoy doing,\" like an engineer doesn't necessarily love running meetings and writing one pagers and strategy docs and taking notes. So I think it's a similar thing where, sure, it's great until you don't really want to be doing that or you don't have time for that and you have your actual job you need to be doing.\n\nDenise Tilles (00:21:41):\nThat's your full-time job and your OKRs and your goals are really around the outcomes for the company, you're like, \"But I wrote 20 scripts this year.\" So we need to help them focus on the things that they're being expected to deliver in terms of value.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:21:56):\nI also think it's funny how many people want to be a product manager until they realize what product management entails. This happens a lot and I saw it with my MBA students at Harvard too. We do a whole class, they play a product manager. I had a lot of people opt out of being a product manager at the end of it. They were like, \"I did not realize it was like that. I did not realize I had to do so many things.\" I think a lot of what gets them as well is the type of context switching that's required as a product manager. So you already, just with the basis of what we have to do, do so many different things of user research, working with the designers, working with the developers, working with executives, working with different stakeholders. You got to context switch to be able to relate to all them. You got to empathize with all these different people. You have to do all these different tasks to do this type of work. \n\n(00:22:46):\nThen you got to go figure out what template to put your roadmap in, which is going to be different template than the other 80 product managers on your team because somebody didn't come in and just say, \"Hey, we're going to use this.\" That type of work to me is just distracting from it. Is it hard for a product leader to just be like, \"Hey, this is a template we're using\"? No, but then if that product leader has to go out and",

Is it hard for a product leader to just be like, \"Hey, this is a template we're using\"? No, but then if that product leader has to go out and train 80 other people on that template, make sure it's consistently updated all the time, make sure it's in the right formats, make sure it's in the right software, that is where the overhead comes in, and a lot of product leaders are doing this right now and what we're trying to do is free up individual product managers, but also those product leaders.\n\n(00:23:33):\nSo I work with all these CPOs, these VPs of product and they're like ... I see them just not working on strategy. I'm like, \"Why are you not working on strategy?\" and they're like, \"I don't have time to do that. I'm in here stopping all these fires. I'm figuring out what template I should put my roadmap in.\" Like I said, it's not hard. They know what template it should be in, but think about if you now can delegate that to somebody else and say, \"I want it in this template. Go roll it out. Go roll it out, go train everybody on it, find the right software for it, do it.\" It frees those people up, the leaders, to go work on strategy. That's why you're spending so much money for a product leader, anyway. That's why you spend so much money for a product manager, anyway. So to me, these things are not impossible to do. It's just do we have the right people doing them?\n\nLenny (00:24:23):\nFor PMs that are trying to figure out what remains on their plate, what are the the pieces that a PM should keep and not offload on a product ops person?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:24:33):\nThey don't want to offload decision rights. You should never be outsourcing your decision making to a product ops person. That's not the point. They're the product manager for the product managers. That's how I think about it. So their decision should be around, \"How do I operationalize great product management here?\" but as a product manager, you shouldn't be delegating to them to make any decisions about their product, and that's not their job. If they are coming to you and saying, \"You should build this,\" that's not their job either. That's not the right thing. \n\n(00:25:03):\nSo making the actual decision and then putting that decision into play with your teams, that's the type of work that you want to hold onto for a product manager. So while a product ops person can help you point you in the right direction, let's say, to find customers, maybe even help you get in touch with the customers, send out the email to invite them to a meeting or operationalize that, hopefully that's automated. I would love a product ops person to automate that type of stuff. You are going to be doing the user research. The product ops person you can go to and maybe say, \"Hey, this is the type of problems that we're understanding,\" and maybe they help you find other pieces of information around the organization on those topics and bring it to you, but they're not going to be the ones reading through all this information and being like, \"You should build this.\" \n\n(00:25:49):\nThey're also not going to be the ones who you say, \"Hey, I made this decision about what to build, told the team about it, the team got together. Can you go monitor the developers and make sure they're building it on time?\" No, they're not project managers, they're not the people who are going to be on top of your developers watching them build things, making sure that everything's out on time. That's not their role either. They're not going to handle hard stakeholder conversations about trade-offs for you, all of those things that you are going to want to keep ownership of because at the end of the day as a product manager, your job is to produce outcomes and you do need to make sure that you're monitoring those outcomes and moving towards them. You don't want to offload their responsibility.\n\nLenny (00:26:31):\nSo I took a couple notes of just things that the PM continues to own, whatever, in quotes, no one owns anything, strategy, vision, prioritizing, resource allocation, trade-off decisions, hard conversations around trade-offs and stakeholder input and things like that. Is there anything else in that bucket of just stuff a PM, a product manager continues to be responsible for?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:26:55):\nWell, there's a big piece that we're missing, go-to-market, and that's where product ops could really make a difference in terms of connecting those teams, but also being the first point of contact for sales, first point of contact for product, and enabling just some efficiencies if we want to call it process or method, but just trying to help break down the silos. \n\n(00:27:19):\nA company I'm working with right now, there's big challenge with that and it's a large enterprise level company. So how do we break down all of the different silos between departments and team leads and whatnot? So it's really talking about, \"Here's how we're going to do it. Here's some simple templates we will use at training sales, training product,\" and then getting that into play. Doing the book and doing our research, that was a consistent story point from a lot of people that we interviewed that go-to-market was a really big pain point",

So it's really talking about, \"Here's how we're going to do it. Here's some simple templates we will use at training sales, training product,\" and then getting that into play. Doing the book and doing our research, that was a consistent story point from a lot of people that we interviewed that go-to-market was a really big pain point.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:27:50):\nSo I think too what Denise was saying is product ops will take on a lot of the coordination of those types of things and making the standardized templates, but as a product manager, your role in informing what the go-to-market is doesn't change. You're still putting the inputs in there. So maybe product ops will provide, for example, templates and help say, \"Hey, here's the different pieces that we need to make a go-to-market plan,\" for example, \"Here's the templates. Here's what I gathered from people,\" but you as a product manager still have to fill out your parts. \n\n(00:28:21):\nYou still have to go talk to the salespeople. You still have to work with the marketing people to make sure it's positioned correctly, but the product ops person can help with the program management around it of getting those people together, having consistent templates, creating the cadence for when you review those things, making sure that they all align and they're all in one place so you're not going to find them everywhere, and then making sure that go-to-market process is consistent across the organization so that it's not like, as Denise said, it's not like everybody's reinventing the wheel and somebody on a go-to-market team has to figure out how to go-to-market differently with a different product team.\n\nLenny (00:28:57):\nAwesome. That's a really handy and important addition. You mentioned project management. I imagine many people think product ops also takes on project management. What's a good way to think about project management versus product ops? There's also program management. Do you have a way of thinking about those roles?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:29:15):\nThe way I like to think about it is, however, whatever they're doing in terms of the three pillars of product ops is really thinking about, as I mentioned earlier, increasing the speed and quality of decision making and all of the pillars of play into that. Program manager, I think, is really thinking about larger company initiatives and the duration of their work is ongoing versus a project manager, they're responsible for certain project that's at a time box and an end date, but it does get a little wiffy, for sure.\n\nLenny (00:29:43):\nI want to go back to the three pillars real quick and go one level deeper to help people understand what they actually entail and what are the jobs of a product ops person. So just we could even keep this brief, but just let's say with business data and insights, what are the functions and jobs and things that a product ops person would be doing for your company?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:30:02):\nA lot of companies will have a data science team or a business intelligence team and you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you don't have to have your internal product ops type of intelligence team, but it's about connecting those and making sure you're putting that with a product lens, and especially, say, with finance too. You don't want all the product managers hitting up the CFO for that month's revenue or having questions. So it's about accessing all of these inputs and putting it through a product lens and then making sure that product managers actually know what to do with it, can action it.\n\nLenny (00:30:36):\nSo it's essentially running queries for you, generating charts and graphs and recommendations based on what the data's telling you. Basically, it's doing all the data stuff that a PM would be doing. Is there anything else there?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:30:51):\nAlso helping the leaders too. So we're talking about it from a product management perspective, but I think this one especially becomes really critical for leaders and executives. A lot of times, and I sit through board meetings where we talk about ARR, we talk about retention, we talk about net retention, and we talk about all of these business metrics, and they're great for monitoring the health of our business, but where product ops comes into play in business data and insights is how do we monitor the health of our product.\n\n(00:31:22):\nSo as a chief product officer, ARR is interesting to me, but it's not as interesting to me as ARR by customer segment. It's not as interesting as ARR by product line. It's not as interesting if I take that and then look at it by retention or adoption by product or feature set or adoption by customer segment by product. When we start to put those lenses on it, they now become a really powerful strategy insight. \n\n(00:31:49):\nSo what I think these people do and do really well is even at the executive level, they help you ... You as a product leader are like, \"I need these types of insights. This helps me. This is how our business runs and this is how I want to set the strategy.\" These people make those dashboards, make those repeatable insights for you. Then ideally, they know the data so well and they know your business so well that they can surface up other opportunities for you as well to look at data that you didn't know was there or can find these interesting trends.\n\n(00:32:18):\nSo they are very much like the people digging into the data, they're just doing it with more of a product lens instead of, like Denise said, an overall company metric lens. It's not just in service of",

Then ideally, they know the data so well and they know your business so well that they can surface up other opportunities for you as well to look at data that you didn't know was there or can find these interesting trends.\n\n(00:32:18):\nSo they are very much like the people digging into the data, they're just doing it with more of a product lens instead of, like Denise said, an overall company metric lens. It's not just in service of the product managers. I just wanted to point that out because I think this becomes so powerful for leaders because if leaders don't understand those types of metrics, they can't actually monitor their strategies. They can't go back and say, \"Oh, we decided to go upmarket into the enterprise.\" Look, we've got enterprise revenue, but are you actually looking at where the enterprises are adopting different product lines? Are you looking at how the enterprise uses different features, and if certain enterprises are using these types of features, are they less likely to churn? It's those types of insights that I think are really important on this lens.\n\nLenny (00:33:09):\nAs a PM hearing that somebody else will be doing this, it feels really weird. This feels like such a core job of a PM is to spend a lot of time with data, try to find opportunities, try to find things going well, not going well, but I think the message, again, is not you shouldn't be doing that as a PM and it's not bad if you are really good at it, it's you probably just don't have a lot of time to do it well. If you can find someone that's really good at this and has time, that doesn't have all the other thousands of things on their plate, you'll actually end up finding more interesting results, finding more interesting insights. You're probably missing a bunch of stuff because you don't actually have a lot of time. Is that generally the way you think about it?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:33:45):\nYeah, and I think too, the business and data insights people, they're not going to be experts on product. They're almost always not. We had a couple analysts at Produx Labs and they were ex-McKinsey, ex-Deloitte. They didn't know anything about product. So we taught them the product piece and we were the ones who were like, \"Here's the interesting data I know I'm going to need to see,\" and they were able to pull those things together in views where we could actually dig into it, but that was a jumping off point on the quantitative research where we're like, \"Okay. Now we need to go do the qualitative.\" \n\n(00:34:18):\nI think for product managers, you still need to be super comfortable with data. If you can't read these charts, if you can't see or understand trends, and a lot of times too, if you're putting this stuff in Looker or a BI tool, ideally, you can pull ad hoc reports yourself. It's just that you don't have to craft a SQL query to do it. You still need to understand the relationship between data and product and you still need to understand what good data looks like. You need to understand too things like causation and correlation. You need to understand that, \"If I put out this crazy marketing launch on Thursday, that's why all of a sudden we got a million signups on Thursday and we didn't get a million signups on Wednesday.\" They still need to understand all those things, and I don't think that becomes any less important. I don't think understanding and interpreting trends becomes any less important as a product manager's job. I just think it's about putting data into the hands of product faster so that it's not about you having to fight your way through bureaucratic processes at your company to get that data.\n\n(00:35:21):\nSo product ops can help streamline things that we know we're going to look at repeatedly. There's a bunch of stuff that we know we should look at. So put them in a dashboard like, \"Why should I have to go pull that report ad hoc every single time?\" Put them in a dashboard, put them in a report. Same for board slides. We had one of my friends who's the chief product officer of Forsta, Brian Bhuta, and he said, \"I love product ops because when we prepare for board meetings, I know there's a certain set of information that I'm going to have to put together for this board meeting, and then when we go do it manually, it becomes obsolete by the time the board meeting's over and then I got to start again and prepare for the next three months and do the board meeting again.\" So it's like you don't want your data to be obsolete. You want this to be in a repeatable fashion for things that you know are repeatable, but it doesn't get you off the hook of still looking for trends and looking for insights.\n\nLenny (00:36:17):\nYou fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers, and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates and you're spending your days basically putting out fires.

That's atlassian.com/lenny. \n\n(00:37:38):\nWe had a guest on, Casey Winters, and he has this perspective that when you have ops, operational people, that's generally a sign that something is not efficient and it could be made more efficient with software and product. Not everything can be productized, but do you have a perspective on that, that ops is often a sign where software, hopefully someday, could do itself?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:38:02):\nYou still need people to oversee those programs. So I don't think they would fully be obsolete. It wouldn't be like this whole role goes away completely, but they're the people who should be looking at, \"What can we do to optimize and streamline this?\" and not do it with human components. I think that's why a product management mindset lands so well to a product ops function too because you're like, \"How do I use software or tools or processes or frameworks to help fill in some of these gaps and standardize it and then let it run?\" That what I was meaning by the shared services model. \n\n(00:38:32):\nIf you really think in that format, it's not like, \"Hey, I need a team of 10,000 product ops people.\" I think you're doing it wrong if you're doing that right. It should be a well-run lean team who thinks about how to leverage tools for this or building your own or whatever and your products for the product team, and that's how it should be seen. So what I mean it shouldn't be obsolete one day, if you are building, let's say, products for the product team, you still need somebody to look over that product and make sure it's relevant. At the pace of everything changing like it does today, so many things are so different than they were five years ago, you want somebody to be looking over that and making sure they're still up-to-date, it's still relevant, it still works for our company and stuff like that, but you're going to have a smaller subset of people doing that. It's not going to be like, \"Oh, I need a product ops team for every product manager that's on here.\" That's not how it should work at all.\n\nLenny (00:39:27):\nI think that is going to make a lot of people feel better hearing that. Do you have any rule of thumb or way of thinking about just how many product ops people you want per product manager, per team? What's a simple heuristic for just how many people you may need?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:39:43):\nI don't have a hard and fast rule on that one, but I would say if you are at a one-to-one ratio, you're doing it wrong. Absolutely. \n\nDenise Tilles (00:39:47):\nIf you're at one-to-hundred, you're doing it wrong. \n\nMelissa Perri (00:39:54):\nYeah, too. I also think it's like ... So when we talked about it too with this hybrid versus shared services model, if you have a hybrid model, let's say, and typically, this is a symptom that your data is not well-instrumented. Let me put it that way as well. Sometimes you need a stopgap holdover until you can well-instrument your data or something, and that could be as long as it takes for certain companies. In this case, like we said, you might have a business data and insights person aligned to every director of product who oversees multiple Scrum teams. You might have one aligned to every VP of product, depending on how much help you need to get the product data out of things.\n\n(00:40:37):\nNow, if you have a very well-instrumented dataset like we were talking about at Doodle or something like that, you're probably going to have way less people because the product managers are armed and capable of going in there and being able to pull the queries themselves, do their ad hoc research themselves because they made it accessible and you made it possible for them to go do that. \n\n(00:40:59):\nSo I do think there's a balance there between how good your company is instrumented both for everything, for all three of these pieces that we're talking about relative to the size of your product ops team. It might take some more manpower at the beginning to get it going, but, ideally, you streamline this team and it becomes pretty lean and pretty small and they're overseeing multiple programs or software systems that run themselves.\n\nLenny (00:41:25):\nWell, it gives me a lot of hope that this isn't going to become just another massive org within a company. It is looking at companies that are incredibly efficient like Ramp and Deal that have very few employees, very few product managers, and they have product ops people. So that tells me there's a lot of leverage that you can find from just maybe, I don't know, one or two that's probably not a large team of product ops people there.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:41:48):\nWe say too, get started with one person.

We described these three pillars and repeatedly through the book we're like, \"Hone in on what's the most important part for you that's going to help you right now,\" that we talk through, and then just take one person and throw that out there. Usually, you can get so much leverage from that that it frees you up to do a lot of the stuff that you need to get done. Then when you're ready and you see the next hurdle and it's not something that first person can take on, then you might add one more person.\n\n(00:42:18):\nThere are different expertise, I think, between the three different pillars and the people who would oversee it, and that's something to take into account as well. So like we said, in business data and insights, that person typically is not an expert on product. Hopefully they get ramped up on it working with you, but they're typically not an expert on product. A lot of times these people are not coming from a product management background. That's going to be actually a different person than I would look at to help with the governance and product pieces. That person needs to be a product background person because they're usually helping roll out the roadmap stuff, coach people on how to do it, helping to define the different systems and processes that you need on your product operating model, and if they have no experience with product management at all, that's going to be really hard for them to do and it's probably not going to be great. \n\n(00:43:05):\nWe do see this trend of people throwing agile coaches at this, and agile coaches who have never been a product manager before in a well-run company are going to struggle there because they're going to revert back to agile processes and optimizing for things like Scrum, but they're not going to do what that role is designed for, which is to help product management processes. We don't usually need another agile coach telling us how to run a standup. We need people to come in and help us figure out who's invited to these cross-functional roadmap reviews, what inputs do we need on there, and what decisions do we need to make coming out of it, and how do we communicate it at the correct level to executives as well so we're not digging into Jira at these meetings in front of A CEO. CEOs don't care about what's in Jira. Well, they shouldn't. Let's put it that way. \n\nDenise Tilles (00:43:57):\nShouldn't.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:43:59):\nThey want to know like, \"What are the big pushes that we're doing to help us reach our strategic objectives?\" So it's helping that they know a little more about the right size of communication, the different cross-functional teams, what product managers do on a daily basis and what's important to them, and that's really critical in that role. So that's where, I think, your teams might just be slightly bigger from a perspective of more than one person. I'm not saying hundreds of people, but you might need a couple different people in this organization because the roles are slightly different. For the market research and the customer research thing too, you might need somebody with a user research background for that. Somebody who did research ops is a great person for that.\n\nDenise Tilles (00:44:41):\nIt's pretty unusual, I think, to see companies start out with an entire team. I worked with Sam's Club and they were planning to do it that way, but mostly we see it starting organically. I think the way [inaudible 00:44:53] mentioned in her story of being a PM and feeling the pain and having the empathy of wanting to make it better, and that's typically the generation of these roles, that it might be someone being allocated part-time from their PM role and finding out that they really do enjoy this enablement aspect of it and that's where it grows.\n\nLenny (00:45:12):\nAwesome. So let's just lean into this topic of just how to start rolling it out at your company, and you've already talked about a bunch of tips there. By the way, if you buy your book at the end there, there's this really beautiful little guy, there you go, I think, on the camera of just a little yellow brick road of all the steps that it takes to roll it out. \n\nDenise Tilles (00:45:12):\nYes, Candyland.\n\nLenny (00:45:32):\nCandyland. So on this topic of just who to start with, sounds like you recommend start with one person, and what I'm hearing is pick one of these three pillars that you think is most highest leverage potentially to take off your product management plate. Is that right?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:45:46):\nYup.\n\nLenny (00:45:49):\nSo what else should people be thinking about in starting to roll this role out, starting to build this team?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:45:56):\nThat's a great question. So one of our case studies is Shintaro Matsui at Amplitude, and he created the role at Amplitude. When you think about, it's Meta. So they're creating a tool that helps in terms of product operations, but they're enabling it there as well. So he's done a really great job of getting that set up and really being a thought leader there. So the case study that",

So he's done a really great job of getting that set up and really being a thought leader there. So the case study that we chatted with him about was introducing it and how do you get it going and how do you build the momentum and show the quick wins. That was his top tip was making sure that you set, understand, first of all, you may have a perception of what the biggest needs are, but doing your listening tour and doing your user research, some research sprints, understanding there may be a huge opportunity, but it also sounds massive in your team of one, where can you make the most difference quickly? Where can you have the most impact? \n\n(00:46:46):\nSo identifying those, celebrating those wins, making sure everybody understands that, and then showing what's above the line with a person of one the capabilities you'll have, and then below the line, things that you may not get but you could if we did think about building the team and setting the expectations as well.\n\nLenny (00:47:04):\nDo you suggest they try to hire someone that has already been a product ops person? Is it okay to hire someone that hasn't then they just become a product ops person? How important is that experience?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:47:14):\nI think if you find someone that's done the role of product management, awesome. If someone's set it up somewhere ... Look at Blake Samic, started from Uber to Strike to AI. Clearly, he's got a model going that's really successful. So if somebody could get a Blake Samic, I would say definitely do that.\n\nLenny (00:47:32):\nIt'd be hard to pull him away from OpenAI. \n\nMelissa Perri (00:47:37):\nI don't think he's leaving there right now. Just started, got a lot of work ahead of him.\n\nLenny (00:47:42):\nWe have a lot of LinkedIn requests right now. Here they come.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:47:46):\nPoor Blake. Sorry, sorry for your inbox. I think too it's about if you're going all in. If you're just trying to get buy-in for this and let's say it's originating from a CPO or a product leader who's like, \"Hey, let's start this out,\" but the company's not ready to invest all the way, you might pull somebody from a different function, let's say, have them be the product ops person and try to rapidly demonstrate value. If you're a CPO or a leader and you're like, \"I got budget. I know this is important. I'm totally bought in. Let's go,\" you're probably better off hiring, let's say, somebody who's done this before, somebody who's experienced, but also somebody who could be more of a VP or director of product ops and then they can go do the hiring and figuring out, \"Do we pull people from other functions and streamline it?\" That helps free up the leader as well from not having to go find 8,000. It's never going to be 8,000 people, but eight people to do that function.\n\n(00:48:43):\nSo that would be a way to look at it as well. So if people are not quite sold on it, you might want to start with one function. Figure out where the burning issue is. Demonstrate that value. Show that it's something that you want to actually invest in, and then you might want to hire in a leader or help build up the team from there.\n\nLenny (00:49:00):\nIt feels like that first hire is so important because if they don't do great, the whole role of product ops starts to get a bad tinge within the company. So there's a lot of pressure on making sure that first person succeeds. I guess more reason to buy your book and make sure that they do it right. \n\nMelissa Perri (00:49:17):\nIf you feel like you as a leader can coach the product ops person and you have time to coach the product ops person, let's say, through being a good product ops person and getting started with it and directing them, you're probably good at taking somebody who does not have experience but has the right skillset and then you can teach them. If you have absolutely no time to coach this person and they're not super self-directed, let's say, so they're not going out taking classes, reading the books, doing that type of thing, probably going to want to hire somebody who's done it before, at least that portion of it, and then that person can help coach other people grow the function. \n\n(00:49:55):\nIt's the same thing with product management. We look at these teams especially in a lot of transformation companies. We have a lot of product managers who've never been product managers before, and a lot of leaders who've never been product managers before, and they ask me, \"Do I hire in experienced leaders or what?\" and I'm like, \"Well, if those product leaders need to go coach other product managers, then you need somebody who's experienced in there. You need somebody who knows how to get that work done. If they don't have time to learn, if you're not on a timeline to actually teach these people these things and get them up to speed, then you need somebody to hit the ground running.\" \n\n(00:50:29):\nSo I'd look at it for how much time do we have to demonstrate value, how much coaching is available to get this person into the right mindset",

I think that that's needed in almost every role, not just this one.\n\nDenise Tilles (00:50:43):\nOne thing I wanted to mention was whether to hire products or product manager person for the role with the background of product ops or product management, there's not a ton of folks out there that have a products title, but as you're looking, dig in because this person may have been doing a lot of the work as a product manager or within that title. So there's a lot of people out there that probably would fit that profile, but not with a proper product ops title.\n\nLenny (00:51:10):\nWhat are the key skills that you find are really important for finding this person, especially if they don't have this role? My guess is dependent on the pillar, if they're data-focused, research-focused or process-focused. What do you suggest to make sure you're looking for when you're hiring this person?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:51:25):\nWith the business data and insights, you're looking for somebody who's really good at interpreting data, telling stories with data, somebody who's good at communicating to many different types of stakeholders about the data and putting it into useful ways. What I wouldn't hire for that role as a first person is it's not a database engineer. That's not what we're doing. We're not SQL-ing, turning things into the right SQL tables. We're instead trying to get the information out of the SQL tables and make sense out of it. \n\n(00:51:59):\nSo we actually find people with consultant backgrounds who are really good at this because they're usually churning out these types of reports and stuff for PE firms, VC firms, and whoever were their clients to begin with. What would be ideal is if that person has a lot of experience with a BI tool like Looker or Tableau as well and they could use it. That's not always the case. Sometimes those people are really good at Excel and PowerPoint, but they're not great at the Looker and BI. If you could find that two things together though, home run right there. \n\n(00:52:31):\nSo this person's probably a data analyst background. We did have a business intelligence background like you were talking about as well, something like that for the business and data and insights role. It does not have to be a product manager. I think you can help them, steer them in the right directions for what questions you need to answer. They shouldn't be the ones coming up with all the questions you need to answer. It'd be great if they surface some insights, but you ask them the questions, they can go get the answers.\n\nLenny (00:53:01):\nWhat about for the other two pillars?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:53:02):\nWell, in terms of the process and practices, I think this person really needs a super high EQ, understanding what the needs are, but also has a good spidey sense of how much methods do we need to think about bringing to the team and thinking about how those things get introduced that it's not a mandate, but it's a suggestion of how we can work. Typically, product managers will be pretty open to that because if they're like, \"I don't know what the roadmap template is. I don't know what the roadmap cadence is.\" \"Here's some guidance.\" \"Awesome. Now I don't have to think about how to do it, I'm just going to do it.\" \n\n(00:53:38):\nSo I think someone who has a lot of experience understanding the underlying tensions and opportunities, and then feels good and understands how to implement the systems thinking and also understands it's not a set it and forget it, that they're constantly reevaluating the processes, the tools, \"Are these working for us?\" Then understands, I think, in more broadly, \"As my CPO is getting ready for a board meeting, what are the inputs they're going to need? As we're getting ready for the QBR, are the PMs ready? Do we have a cohesive stories? Anybody taking the time to look at all of the different presentations to make sure that we're giving the same perspective or building towards a certain strategy that everybody's focused on?\" So that would be my advice.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:54:30):\nI think for customer and market research part, you're looking for somebody with more of a user research background here, but process-oriented. So I'd look for somebody who knows user research code, knows really good tactics for that because it can help create the toolkits, get the right type of prototyping and usability software in there. They know what good interviewing looks like, that type of stuff, but they also got this need to make things better. So they're like, \"I need to create a system to do this.\" They're good at operationalizing stuff. I think that's a skill for everybody. They're like, \"I can build a system to fix this.\" That's actually a really good interview guild that I would ask a product ops person and I never came up with it. I never thought about that before, but it's like, \"Tell me about some process or something that you had to do in your job that you really hated and that you ended up just trying to automate a way or build a system around it to make it better.\" That would be a great interview question for anybody",

So Jen Cardello, who is our case study on Fidelity, she runs their user insights team there and she's our VP of, I think it's user insights and she does oversee all the user researchers as well, but she also oversees a research ops team, and the research ops team is responsible for building their participant database. They also help build toolkits for people to do user research. They oversee any of the user research tools. They also go out and train other people in doing good user research. \n\n(00:56:07):\nSo with them, that looks like not everybody's allowed to go talk to customers and financial firms like this because of compliance reasons. They make sure they certify people to be able to go do good research up to certain points and they get levels for how far they can go so that they can democratize the research and help put it into their hands. Then if there's compliant issues around different research studies, they come back to Jen's team and the user researchers will help them complete it. \n\n(00:56:33):\nSo it's about how we ... There's a lot of legal things about what you can say and what you can't say to customers and stuff like that, what you can ask them, and they're navigating those complexities around there. So Jen comes from a research ops background. She comes from a whole UX background, but research ops is her thing and she's fantastic at setting up that stuff. She and I worked together at Athenahealth and she did that there. So I watched her put that into place and it was amazing and now she does it at Fidelity. \n\n(00:57:00):\nSo if you find somebody with that background, golden, but if you find somebody who ... If you can't find somebody like Jen because there's only one Jen, you should look for somebody who has at least a user research background, probably some UX background. They're really good at doing that and they want to operationalize it.\n\nLenny (00:57:18):\nJen's about to get a bunch of LinkedIn requests too.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:57:22):\nSorry for your inbox, Jen.\n\nLenny (00:57:23):\nI feel like the research team is going to hate people now for pulling you into product ops. Who would you suggest product ops report to generally at least to start?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:57:35):\nHead a product. \n\nDenise Tilles (00:57:35):\nCPO. \n\nLenny (00:57:38):\nSuch a clear, quick answer. I love it. How do they find time to train and work with this person? Are they the right-hand person that helps them just make everything more efficient? What's a way? What's that relationship like?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:57:50):\nI think definitely their right-hand person, and we say to a lot of CPOs, especially high growth companies, \"Make your first hire just a product ops person to help you get this data out and start looking at it,\" because that helps them with board meetings, it helps them set strategy. Usually when you walk into a growth stage company, that's the first thing that you need to do is make sure that it's working, that you need to set it. Typically, when you're getting hired, there's usually a strategy problem and that person, they're like your right-hand man trying to operationalize that. So I definitely think that you're going to be guiding them there. \n\n(00:58:23):\nI think this comes back to our question though about, do you hire somebody with experience or do you hire somebody who's new to it? If you as a CPO don't have a lot of time to train up somebody on product ops because you've got 8,000 fires to fight, then hire somebody with experience who knows how to do it and operationalize it. If you are like, \"My biggest issue is business data and insights,\" for example, \"and I just need to get my data so that I can do the strategy pieces and then I need to think through and work through what I want product ops to look like,\" maybe then you just hire the data analyst. If they're confident in the data analysis piece, it's pretty easy, I haven't done this myself, to teach them about what types of information you need to see as a product person. They're going to need a lot more handholding at the beginning because they're not going to know all the different cuts of data, but it's not an investment of an inordinate amount of time to be able to get something valuable back. \n\n(00:59:20):\nIt's not like training for 40 hours a week and then waiting six months to see results. It's more about, \"I need you to go pull these types of cuts. Here's why. Let me explain to you this so that you learn it and then you can think about it next time,\" but that's going to help you there too. So I think it really depends. So how fast you need product ops fully rolled out and then how much time you have to train people, and then where you're starting from there and how",

Maybe as a last question, I'd love to go through a quick case study of a company you worked with and just share maybe how you rolled it out, what you ran into, challenges you had to overcome, and maybe the benefits and impact that adding this role had.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:00:06):\nWhen I was at Athenahealth, we were doing a ... Athenahealth has always been a software company, so let me put it that way, but they didn't have a formal product management role and they had just implemented it when I came in. So the chief product officer brought me in. He did not have an extensive product background, so he said, \"I need to train all these product people and figure out what to do with this organization.\" So I came in to help him do that. We had over 360 product managers. We had 5,000 software developers there and it was a massive platform, $8 billion in market cap, I think, electronic health record system. \n\n(01:00:42):\nSo this is where I started to realize we needed product ops. This was me discovering this. So I'll tell you how we rolled it out and probably what we would do differently next time, but we had trained all the product managers. People were starting to use a lot of the things that we were teaching, and we saw that the maturity was getting a lot better in the organization, which was fantastic, but then we started to run into these problems, and these problems that we found could not be solved by just training product managers, and that's where the concept for product ops came up. \n\n(01:01:11):\nWe also realized we had way too many product managers, just way too many product managers. There was one person reporting into one person all the way down, and we were like, \"This is not helpful.\" So we ended up training everybody, teaching people about what the role was, and then thinking through as we encounter these other problems, \"What else do we need besides product managers?\" Product ops became one of the things. We also had people actually move out of product management into other roles. We had people become data analysts, we had people become user researchers, we had people go into other parts of the organization, but a lot of people after we trained them actually just self-selected out of product management and some of them did come to us and say, \"What else is there?\" \n\n(01:01:53):\nWhen we looked at the product ops role, we said, \"Okay. What are the big fires that we have to fight that's just not from a lack of skills perspective?\" That's a big part about product ops. It's not a replacement for product managers or product leaders not having product management skills. It's to help skilled product managers and product leaders do their job better. So this will never replace the fact that people don't have the skills to do their job. \n\n(01:02:19):\nSo where we ran into issues was, one, getting insights back to the executives on what the teams were actually doing. So the CEO and I were sitting there trying to set strategy and set the vision for the company and I was helping him formulate it into written form and help him deploy it and think through where we want it to go. He was in Jira, digging around in Jira trying to find information on what people were working on, and I was like, \"You're not going to find that in Jira, especially when we've got hundreds of thousands of tickets for 5,000 people. You're not going to find this in there.\" \n\n(01:02:57):\nThat started to show me, \"Hey, he's looking for this. What do you want to see?\" He's looking for a portfolio roadmap of what everybody's doing and he wanted to see what are the big pushes we're making from a feature perspective and how do they tie back to our overall strategy and our goals. What's going to help our retention? What's going to help us get new customers? What's going to help us move into the enterprise, which was a big thing we were doing going upmarket into hospitals? We had no transparency into the allocation of R&D on that and also the roadmaps on that. \n\n(01:03:29):\nSo one of the things that we were trying to do in product ops was build that view, try to figure out how we get people to put the right information into Jira at the right level. So we actually had to train people on how to write ... At the time, we only had Jira, so epics in Jira that were not just build a button, they were more substantial than that. They actually had to meet behind it so we could look at it. Then we had to go out and find the right software to roll that up into a portfolio view so the executives could get the insights they were looking for.\n\n(01:04:00):\nWe also had to build a way to track the OKRs that were deployed and actually see where it was. So we had to build the dashboards for that. So we started there and that became really important because that was a big issue was just the executive visibility, how do we make consistent roadmaps across the organizations, how do we get visibility into what's",

So we had to build the dashboards for that. So we started there and that became really important because that was a big issue was just the executive visibility, how do we make consistent roadmaps across the organizations, how do we get visibility into what's going on. As we started to identify more and more things, we said, \"We're a huge team. We should actually have somebody overseeing this.\" \n\n(01:04:27):\nData and insights was a really big issue in the company in general, and we knew we had to instrument things better, and at the time, they brought in Amplitude and they were starting to put an Amplitude everywhere in the organization, but it wasn't fully rolled out yet. So we had these people who were going around trying to help the individual product teams get the information out of Amplitude and we said, \"We need this to be more of a consistent thing, a consistent program.\" \n\n(01:04:52):\nSo that sparked the need for having our first product operations leader. So we ended up creating a VP of product operations and somebody moved from the product management role into that. She was much more of a process type person. She wanted to really help arm the teams into being able to get good data out there, but she understood product management well enough where she knew how all this stuff worked and she wanted to create the systems internally. \n\n(01:05:17):\nSo reporting into her, we had a business data and insights team that was overseeing Amplitude rollout and they were also putting people around the director level overseeing usually five to let's say eight Scrum teams on the director level, sometimes smaller just depending on the product. We had a business data and insights person embedded at that level to help get the ad hoc reports out now because we weren't well-instrumented. We said, \"We're still making the programs and the shared services at the top level, but these people need to make decisions today. So how do we get them to do that?\" So she oversaw that team. She had somebody directed there. \n\n(01:05:55):\nthen we also had the people looking at the portfolio views and the governance and the rollout and the rollout of that getting put into that as well. So that helped us get going with that. On the other side, so this didn't fall under product operations at the time, but like I said, Jen Cardello was doing research ops there and leading this team around the user insights. She got the participant database out. That was fantastic. She got out a bunch of different user research tools. They made a design systems database too that helped us be able to do prototyping a lot faster and have consistent design processes, which was amazing.\n\n(01:06:32):\nThe head of UX reported into the chief product officer. So it still fell under the CPO, but it reported into the head of UX on that side and that was totally fine because we just collaborated with them pretty much all the time. So that's how we started to roll it out and get going and that's where that need was and it became so much better to get the insights that we needed out there. \n\n(01:06:53):\nThen what happened was, actually, Athenahealth at this time, it was really wild and private. So this is where I left and a lot of leaders left at the same time, but they ended up restructuring it and they actually kept the product ops team. So now, Tim Davenport oversees product ops team. He was the chief of staff for the chief product officer at the time and he's been building it, again, taking the stuff that worked and then building onto it, and they're actually one of our key studies in the book as well about what Tim's doing now and how he's orchestrated as well to help with opex and capex and accounting type issues that they were having too. \n\n(01:07:28):\nSo Athenahealth has been through many different restructurings since I've been there, but they have always kept product ops and their current chief product officer said that he will never go anywhere else that doesn't have product ops. That's how much he believes in it.\n\nLenny (01:07:43):\nWow. What a testament to the value of product ops, 100% retention on the role through all these transitions. One of the interesting things you said is within this VP of product ops managed a bunch of different people and teams, which is really interesting because I always imagine product ops VP would manage product ops people. Is that common where they lead, say, there's a data team you mentioned and a few other team?\n\nMelissa Perri (01:08:06):\nYeah. In this case, we did have her managing the business data and insights people and they were data analysts. I wouldn't say they were data engineers or anything like that, but there were people who were really good at pulling SQL and analyzing data from a product perspective. We actually moved. I should say this as well. We moved a lot of people who didn't want to be product managers but were good at that out of the role and into that role. So they had some product background, they had been trained in product, they were really good at the data pieces, but they were more suited for that than they were suited for product management. Like I said, a lot of people opted out. They were like, \"Get me out of this role. I don't want to do this.\" They wanted more of a transactional type role or diving into data, and a lot of it came down to I think people under anticipate how much they're going to have to deal with stakeholders,",

There was a whole data team on the CTO side who were doing more of the database administration and the instrumentation of things. They were also helping to roll out Amplitude, instrument it correctly, and building the right views and things like Amplitudes or the other product analytics or other tools that they were using. We did not have Tableau at the time. That was something that was added later, but they were in charge of utilizing the data and trying to build those insights.\n\nLenny (01:09:33):\nAmazing. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've never done this with two people. We'll see how it goes. So you can pick the question you want to take or both answer. Here we go. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nDenise Tilles (01:09:48):\nI'll take that. Of course, Escaping the Build Trap. It's true. \n\nMelissa Perri (01:09:51):\nI thought you would say that. \n\nDenise Tilles (01:09:54):\nAnother one that I recommend is called Traffic. It came out this year by Ben Smith, around the invention and growth of HuffPo and Gawker and whatnot. I was in media at Condé Nast then, so peripherally part of it. It's an exciting ride that has an ending that we all know, but it's a good story, good tale.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:10:15):\nThe Art of Action I think is a fantastic book on strategy and I always recommend this to people and it's out of the realm. There's a lot of great product management books out there too, but I like this one because it's a sleeper hit, I think, in the product management community. It is a fantastic description of deploying strategy and how you can tell if strategy is well-deployed in organizations or if there's gaps that you need to fill. So I find that when people read it, they go, \"Oh, my God, we have all of these problems,\" and I'm like, \"Yup, that's a strategy deployment and strategy creation problem. That's pretty apparent.\" So that's my favorite book to recommend to people. I love Theresa Torres' Continuous Discovery Habits. Fantastic book as well, just to give a shout out in the product world too.\n\nLenny (01:10:57):\nNext question, favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nDenise Tilles (01:11:01):\nDeutschland 82, 86, 89. It's on Hulu. Highly recommend it, about East Germany. \n\nLenny (01:11:08):\nLike Pedal.\n\nDenise Tilles (01:11:09):\nYeah, really great.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:11:12):\nI am going to go ... I just watched the House of Usher on Netflix. I love the ... It's Halloween right now. Well, it was just Halloween. \n\nDenise Tilles (01:11:12):\nPerfect. \n\nMelissa Perri (01:11:22):\nSo I was watching all the scary movies, but I love the Netflix genre of everything from the Haunting of Hill House. Those were great.\n\nLenny (01:11:31):\nAmazing. I started watching that and then I gave up quickly, but I should give it another chance. My wife and I have been stuck on Love is Blind. Classic.\n\nDenise Tilles (01:11:39):\nSame. \n\nMelissa Perri (01:11:40):\nGood one.\n\nDenise Tilles (01:11:40):\nSame. \n\nMelissa Perri (01:11:40):\nGood one. \n\nLenny (01:11:41):\nWhat a terrible, wonderful show.\n\nDenise Tilles (01:11:43):\nIt is. It's the high low.\n\nLenny (01:11:45):\nNext question, do you have a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask when you're hiring people?\n\nDenise Tilles (01:11:49):\nWhen was the last time you changed your mind about something really important and why? So do they have a learning mindset? Do they have self-awareness? Can they acknowledge where they were and how they evolved? So that's usually a pretty insightful question.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:12:06):\nMine's probably tell me about a time that you failed and what happened. That one's an interesting one too because if nobody has an example of a time that they failed, that right there is an interesting sign. Two, I feel like everybody tries to turn it into a positive story. They really try to spin it and I'm like, \"I don't even want you to spin it. I just want to tell me what you learned.\" It's fine to say what you learned at the end of that. I think that's okay, but they're like, \"Oh, but this happened and all these things were great afterwards,\" and I'm like, \"I'm not looking for a fantastic outcome. I'm just looking for did you fail and did",

It's not that I recently discovered it, but I talked about all the issues that we had at Athenahealth with the portfolio management system, and after that, I discovered Dragon Boat and I'm now on their advisory board, but it helped me solve that problem. So much of rolling up everything that was in Jira sits on top of it and being able to look at it in a great view. So that was so, so good. \n\n(01:13:13):\nAnother one that I have not been involved with but that I just really love because I think they're doing great things with, again, in the product ops world, is Dovetail and they are a research repository out there and they're also putting AI on top of it to help generate insights into all the research that's been done. I have no affiliation with Dovetail, but I really love what they're doing because I've had that problem of us rolling our own research repository over and over and over again, and now we've got a tool out there to do it.\n\nDenise Tilles (01:13:42):\nI guess the one I would mention is Vistali, and some product leaders that I'm working with right now are playing around with it, and it's an interesting tool that's a single workspace that you can connect your strategy and discovery and delivery visually and guides people along those paths as well. So interested to play with it more, but it piqued my interest.\n\nLenny (01:14:05):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, often share with someone, come back to often to help either with work or with life?\n\nDenise Tilles (01:14:15):\nMine's both, especially with teams that I'm working with or cross-functional stakeholders that if you try to serve everybody, you serve no one. So it's about honing in on who you're actually building your product for, who your persona is, and then with my children in terms of try to be everyone's friend, but it may not happen. So it goes both ways.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:14:37):\nWhat's the worst that can happen with most of the things that I've done? To me when I get scared about something or trying to do something or even interpersonal reactions where I'm like, \"God, I have to have this hard conversation with this person,\" my brain, I try to tell myself, \"What's the worst that can happen?\" Usually when you sit down and start to think about it, it's not as bad as you anticipate. So for me, that's always helped me manage my anxiety around difficult situations or taking a leap and trying to get out there. I think in my younger days, I was a little crippled by overthinking and by being too anxious about things and not taking big leaps. So I've tried to stick by that and keep asking myself, \"What's the worst that can happen?\" and it's usually not as bad as you think it is. \n\nLenny (01:15:27):\nI love that. Final question, since there's two of you, we'll end in a really sweet way. What's one thing you really admire about each other?\n\nDenise Tilles (01:15:36):\nMelissa is a legend, but behind the legend, she's just a really great collaborative person. So of course, we got to know each other really well writing this book together. We worked together before that, but it was a really great way of staying connected to a former colleague, someone in the industry. Especially during COVID, it was a really great way of building towards something that was bigger than the both of us. So what I love about her is that she's really revered by so many folks, but really approachable and really truly wants to help people.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:16:16):\nThanks, Denise. What I love about Denise is she's really this calming, patient presence and she approaches everything with so much professionalism, but also can really get to the meat of the problem, help calm down certain situations where escalated, turn them around, and she's got this patience and calm about her in everything that she does that helps you focus, helps you concentrate on the big issues and she can really steer people in the right direction. So to me, I've always admired watching her coach and lead people. She led her analysts at Produx Labs as well. When things would go slightly awry or a situation would go out of hand, Denise was always like, \"Nope, we'll just fix it,\" and dove in and was able to make it better. I always really appreciated that.\n\nDenise Tilles (01:17:13):\nOh, shocks. We might've had a few of the what's the worst that could happen moments, right?\n\nMelissa Perri (01:17:16):\nAlways.\n\nLenny (01:17:17):\nAmazing. You two are awesome. For folks listening, make sure to grab their book, Product Operations. You can find it on Amazon, I imagine. Share where else people can find it, but two final questions.

Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nDenise Tilles (01:17:32):\nProductoperations.com, we've got some downloadables that are available for folks and questions if you want to get in touch with us. How can they help us? I'm trying to think here.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:17:44):\nTell us your stories about product operations. We want to hear how people are implementing it, what's working, what's not working. We're always learning about this too, and I think we said in this book, it's ticking off now, but it's by no means standardized. So we want to hear about what's happening, how has your company been successful or not successful with it, what have you seen work, what have you seen not work. So definitely reach out and let us know about it. Also, you can help us by buying the book and leaving us an Amazon review if you do read it because that does help authors and we self-publish this one too, so that always helps us on there. \n\n(01:18:17):\nYou can find both of us on LinkedIn as well. I'm Melissa Jean Perri, I think on, there, but if you look for Melissa Perri, I usually pop up and Denise Tilles. Then if you want to contact us, product operations.com, we got a form on there to reach out.\n\nLenny (01:18:31):\nProductoperations.com. Is that the best way to find where to buy the book or are there other sites you recommend people go check it out?\n\nMelissa Perri (01:18:37):\nWe do. We just got it. Self-publishing has been fun, but we just got it where it is distributing now to Barnes and Noble and other bookstores. So you can usually find it on anything, but if you go to the website, it will have the most up-to-date information on where you can find it. Then if you go to your bookstore and some people are against Amazon, so if you go to your bookstore and ask for it, they will be able to order it for you.\n\nLenny (01:19:00):\nAmazing. Thank you two for being here.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:19:03):\nThanks for having us.\n\nDenise Tilles (01:19:04):\nThanks for having us.\n\nLenny (01:19:05):\nMy pleasure.

Again, you can go back to animals. It's like when their fundamental functions, when their core behaviors of diet, exercise, playfulness, socialization, sleep, when those things get disrupted, it's a sign that there is something going on here that you need to take a look at. \n\n(00:00:27):\nSo the same is true with people. If your sleep always sucks, if your relationships are constantly strained or frequently strained, if your physical health is failing, there's so many ways that that can be measured. So there's really no excuse for that to say, \"Oh, I just didn't know.\" I'd say it's to look at those things. When those are suffering or when they're really out of whack, it's undeniable that there is something that is detrimental to your wellbeing that's going on right now, and your body is telling you, \"Stop. Something needs to change.\"\n\nLenny (00:01:03):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Andy Johns. This is going to be a very different type of episode and maybe the most meaningful and important episode of the podcast. \n\n(00:01:21):\nAndy was a legendary product and growth leader at Facebook, Twitter, Quora, and Wealthfront, where he was VP of Growth and VP of Product, and then President, and as you'll hear, was in line to be CEO of Wealthfront until he came to realize that this path was not right for him. After a lot of internal reflection and hard self-work, he changed his entire life's path to becoming a mental health advocate and helping burned out high achievers and also veterans with their mental health journey. \n\n(00:01:48):\nIn our conversation, Andy shares his personal story, what true burnout looks like, and when you should pay attention to your mental health. Talks about the process of deep personal transformation and the four steps involved in making lasting change in your life. He also shares how to actually allow change to happen in your life, tactics for moving down this path, and a lot of advice and real talk on mental health and tech.\n\n(00:02:10):\nThere's a lot of struggle happening in the world right now, including in tech, and so I hope this conversation helps you with your own journey. You can check out Andy's work at Clues.Life. With that, I bring you Andy Johns after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:26):\nThis episode is brought to you by Mercury, who I also happen to use for my business checking account.

You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together, and how can it help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda. \n\n(00:04:07):\nIf your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups.

Happy to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:54):\nSo I've been both looking forward to our conversation, but I've also been dreading it a little bit because I know it's going to be incredibly valuable, but I also think it's going to get very heavy, and I think it's important to get heavy sometimes, especially with the stuff we're going to be talking about, but just wanted",

Happy to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:54):\nSo I've been both looking forward to our conversation, but I've also been dreading it a little bit because I know it's going to be incredibly valuable, but I also think it's going to get very heavy, and I think it's important to get heavy sometimes, especially with the stuff we're going to be talking about, but just wanted to share that.\n\nAndy Johns (00:05:09):\nYeah, and I'm looking forward to that. I think one of the things that has been a change for me over the last several years is that I prefer to move forward in my life being completely honest with who I am, not hiding any aspects of myself, including the stuff that in the past I'd be afraid to share. \n\nLenny (00:05:29):\nWell, on that topic, I'd love for you to just walk us through the path that you've taken. Basically, you're like me in a sense. You're helping companies build product, drive growth, worked with some of the best companies in the world, and then things took a turn. So could you just start with a brief overview of what happened? \n\nAndy Johns (00:05:48):\nSure. So the short background is I spent about 17 years working in the world of startups. I think on the whole, it was a successful experience. I managed to land at a handful of really good companies and had a great experience, but along the way, despite having built somewhat of an impressive resume, I guess you could say, I was also struggling quite a bit in terms of my emotional, psychological, and spiritual health. So in some ways, it feels like the cliche that as my career reached its pinnacle, that from a professional, from a financial perspective, I was at my highest, but when it came to other aspects of my life, I was arguably at my lowest or close to my lowest. \n\n(00:06:43):\nSo even though I had those successes, there was a lot that I needed to work through that was under the hood, which I eventually came to understand very, very deeply as a result of turning inward and doing a lot of work on my own path towards self-understanding and healing some deep emotional wounds.\n\nLenny (00:07:04):\nIn a post that you worked on for my newsletter back in the day, you shared this story of, I think maybe it was at Wealthfront where you were giving a big presentation. Maybe share that story?\n\nAndy Johns (00:07:14):\nSure. I can share that. It actually goes back to ... This is 2010. I was at Twitter at the time. I was in my late 20s. Again, my career was going really well. I was starting to string together a series of successful experiences, and I was suddenly hit with near constant panic, panic attacks, depression. I was having a very, very difficult time sleeping and just managing my emotions as a whole. It got to the point to where there were several occasions while I was at work where I could tell that I was about ready to have a breakdown of sorts, and I would just grab my laptop, throw it in my bag, and pretty quietly just walk out of the office even if it was 10:00 AM and I'd only been there for an hour or two. That happened on multiple occasions. \n\n(00:08:07):\nThere were some occasions in which I was set up to go and speak to the entire company during an all-hands session, and it was something where I just had to come up with an excuse and bow out of it because at the time, I was already completely overcome and overwhelmed by this near constant panic I was experiencing, but I had a really good poker face, I don't think most people could see it.\n\n(00:08:34):\nTo give a little bit of an explanation and to tie first question together with this, there were two major things that contributed to me having a pretty acute case of burnout and needing to step away from my career as I knew it. The first was just the slow and steady accumulation of the pressure, the stresses, the anxieties, the emotional ups and downs that came from having such a strong commitment to my career, and frankly an addiction to achievement as a way to feel good and to feel whole, but I was so focused on my work that I had slowly become the frog that was boiling in the pot, the typical analogy of you don't realize how bad things are getting because it's happening to you slowly until it happens quickly, right?\n\n(00:09:38):\nSo on one hand, I was not only struggling emotionally and psychologically because of the pressures of the career and climbing the ladder and just the common existential angst that comes with being at a startup and not knowing what the future holds. What I later came to understand was that I was also starting to experience and to address old emotional pain that I'd buried for a very long time, stemming back to the death of my mom when I was 10. She was severely mentally ill. She was bipolar, had bouts of psychosis, and had spent time in and out of psychiatric hospitals. I can remember going to those hospitals as some of my earliest memories as a kid.\n\n(00:10:33):\nSo there was a lot of disruption in my childhood, a lot of neglect, some occasional abuse, and then it culminated with the loss of the most important female figure in my life when I was 10. Of course, like anyone else after that, I was in a lot of pain emotionally, but as a kid, you don't have the tools or even the capabilities to effectively process something as significant and traumatic as an experience like that. \n\n(00:11",

The thing that I had latched onto that made me feel better was that anytime I hit a home run or scored a goal or got straight A's and was just basically a stellar student and a stellar athlete, I was showered with love, not only from my family, which is fantastic, but from society at large, especially within the world that we live in.\n\n(00:11:44):\nSo I learned very early on that if I wanted to feel good, I needed to achieve, and that if I wanted to love myself and be considered lovable by others, I needed to achieve. That pulled me out of a darkness that I was in for several years as a kid, and I'm glad that it did, and it led to an excellent experience in high school, in college, and then well into my 20s, but eventually, those emotional wounds are going to come to the surface. They're going to come up for error, and when they do, it's going to be difficult, and that's what happened with me. \n\n(00:12:24):\nSo it was really two things coming together at the same time. It was the growing pressures of an escalating career within the dynamic industry, but then also, I think, the natural maturation of my mind and of adult development such that it was time for that old pain to come to the surface, and when it did, it was very disruptive and it's something that I'm still continuing to work on to this day.\n\nLenny (00:12:55):\nI imagine many people listening either resonate with some of this or just like, \"This is exactly the life I'm living.\" I know you work with people now helping them through these challenges, especially in tech. So two questions there. One is just you've done polls around this. Just what percentage of people in tech have you seen struggle with these sorts of things on some degree?\n\nAndy Johns (00:13:16):\nFor the last two years, I've been doing a lot of writing, and most of my writing has really just been me opening up and sharing this personal side of what was going on behind the scenes. Along the way, I've been able to connect with, at this point, hundreds of folks in the tech industry who are dealing with their own forms of burnout or their own deep existential questions that are coming to the surface and they're trying to understand them.\n\n(00:13:48):\nSo from some of the surveys I've put out from my own anecdotal experience and from some proper research that's been conducted by experts who focus on entrepreneur and high performer wellbeing, I'd say that it's a fair estimate to say that at least 50% to 60% of tech employees who have, just to give it a bit more nuance, who have been in the saddle, so to speak, for a minimum of five to seven years, they're experiencing some form of psychological and emotional distress. It may be minor enough such that they think it's just day-to-day anxiety, but it's often much more significant than people realize because, again, it creeps up on you slowly and then all of a sudden it hits you quickly.\n\nLenny (00:14:42):\nWe're going to dive into what this looks like and ways you've found to be helpful to people. One last question before we get there. You walked away from a pretty senior incredible role, and in the post that you wrote, you shared the salary you gave up in that giving up. Can you just talk about what that last role was and then what you had to give up to change career paths and [inaudible 00:15:05]\n\nAndy Johns (00:15:04):\nYeah. So one of the things that I did towards the tail end of my career as I became a consumer or founding partner of the consumer arm of an early stage venture capital firm, and most folks know that especially once a fund gets big enough, it can be a high paying job. Suddenly, I found myself in a position where I was making high six figures per year into early seven figures. When I look back on it in retrospect, I had put in so much effort to get to that point really going back to when I was 10 years old, having always been the straight A student and captain of whatever team I was on. \n\n(00:15:46):\nFrom the age of 10 to basically 35, I was switched on, constantly seeking to perform at the top of whatever my field was. So I gotten to that point first as an executive at a high growth startup, that was Wealthfront, and I became president and was next in line to be CEO before I had a health scare with my heart that led to me stepping away from the company because I knew I couldn't take on the CEO position. Then here I was six or seven months later, again, very subconsciously driven by the desire to succeed because underneath that was the sense that I wasn't lovable unless I was succeeding. \n\n(00:16:30):\nHere I was after a heart attack scare at the age of 35 sweeping that under the carpet like I'd swept so much stuff under the carpet and choosing to join on as a founding partner of a venture capital firm, which is not an easy job at all, and especially when you're",

So it was another startup. It was my sixth startup in a row. \n\n(00:16:59):\nSo three years into that though, even though I was working on my own mental health and my emotional wellbeing, I had convinced myself repeatedly for so many years that everything was okay and that I could continue to put my head down and run through these walls, these professional walls and keep going, but it got to a point to where that was no longer the case. \n\n(00:17:32):\nIn fact, it was the culmination of conversations with my doctors and with the experts that I've been working with where I ended up actually spending 45 days in a mental health institute myself. It was something that was extremely difficult to do. It was something that certainly contributed or was really the tip of the sphere of me stepping away from my career of realizing that the only reason I was continuing to push forward despite how poorly I felt on the inside was because of stuff that had happened to me when I was much younger and because of the fallible nature of the human mind and how it wants to interpret experiences and ways that can become so self-critical and self damaging.\n\n(00:18:32):\nSo that happened for me roughly three years ago. Needless to say, my life has changed quite a bit since then, and I'm happy to chat more about that, but that was a difficult decision to walk away from my career at the peak of it, but I guess the takeaway, and then I'll stop for a bit, is it's important for people to understand that there are formative experiences in our lives which put us in positions to where we form adaptations in order to survive, just like my attachment to achievement and how my self-worth was entirely tied up in that.\n\n(00:19:14):\nI needed that when I was younger because I was heartbroken, I lost a parent, and that adaptation that I formed saved my life when I was young, and it gave me a great childhood after that, and a great next couple of decades, but these adaptations, if you're unaware of them and if you're unaware of the subconscious drivers that are responsible for them, they run the risk that they go too far, and that these adaptations, which were initially beneficial to you and to your life, they reverse course in a sense, and they become detrimental to your present state and your future development. \n\n(00:20:04):\nSo my stepping away from the career, stepping away from the high salary, and stepping away from everything I'd worked so hard to obtain was an action that I took in recognition of the fact that that early life adaptation had now gone awry and was responsible for my life heading in a negative direction and it was time to change.\n\nLenny (00:20:30):\nThe gift of your experience going through all that is that now we can all benefit learning from that. You spend your time these days helping people get over a lot of these challenges that they have. Can you just talk about what it is you spend your time on specifically? Then let's unpack the process that you've come up with to help people through this.\n\nAndy Johns (00:20:52):\nNow, when people ask me what I do, I say I do mental health advocacy, and I do it in a few ways. One is I sit on the board of a nonprofit called Heroic Hearts Project, and what we do is we raise money so that we can pay for military veterans with PTSD to get access to alternative therapies, namely psychedelic assisted psychotherapy. It was started by a handful of veterans. I was lucky enough to meet a few of them a couple of years ago. Given my own personal experience with PTSD stemming from my childhood experiences, I was bonded together with these men and women of the Armed Forces who had, in many cases, not only their own personal trauma, but also war trauma. So that's one organization that I'm thankful to be able to work with and help out. \n\n(00:21:48):\nI also write my newsletter and have created a new website that I'm toying with. In general, my writing and the content that I've put out is focused on the unhappy achievers, the other folks like myself who are out there, which there's quite a few of us. I write in order to express my personal experience because I think there's many others that can relate. So those are the things that I've been working on and a little bit of coaching with some of the high performers as well.\n\nLenny (00:22:23):\nThrow out the website in case people want to check it out while we're talking.\n\nAndy Johns (00:22:26):\nThe website that I'm playing around with is called Clues.Life, clues as in questions, clues, not truth dot life or facts dot life. I called it Clues Dot Life for a reason because if there's one thing that I've learned in my own personal journey, it's that given the immense heterogeneity of the human population and how we're all born unique and then we're made further unique through our own individual life experiences, the thing that's clear to me is that if somebody is going through their own struggles, at the end of the day, they have to find the philosophies, the tools, and the methods that work for them. \n\n(00:23:08",

So that's why I called it Clues Dot Life because I'm building this library of mental health information that allows people to navigate all of this information in search of their own clues.\n\nLenny (00:23:28):\nAwesome, and we'll link to that in the show notes, but it's an easy URL to remember. Something you spent a lot of your time on as you've talked about is helping people through deep personal transformation. That's the way you describe it. What is involved in that process of someone going through a deep personal transformation?\n\nAndy Johns (00:23:47):\nI love this question. So most of the conversations I have are with folks who are going through significant change. Now, what's involved in that? It can happen on a spectrum where everyone's process is unique. We all change and unfold in identical ways. Some can go through subtle shifts. I've heard this referred to as a micro transition, where, for example, they may be working at a tech industry or at a tech company, but this specific company they're working at, they have no real values connection to it. So part of their suffering is the fact that they feel that the work that they're doing doesn't really matter or they don't feel a connection to it. So switching to work at a different company that's aligned with something that's consistent with their values, that may be enough for somebody to go through a small transition and then find themselves in a happier place. \n\n(00:24:52):\nThe transitions that I talk about are the big fundamental ones like the transition that I've been going through myself. Now, what's involved in that? I think that there are four parts, just to give it a simple general framework. Step one is it begins with suffering. These large transitions in life rarely take place in the absence of suffering. So step number one is suffer. Usually, the deeper somebody suffers, the more significant the transition that may follow. There's a reason why in the 12 steps community like Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, you name it, there's a reason that rock bottom is in the vernacular because rock bottom tends to proceed somebody getting sober. So step one is suffering. \n\n(00:25:53):\nStep two is seeking the truth behind why we suffer. Once the suffering gets so bad in somebody through some spiritual intervention, a legal intervention, the intervention of friends and family, whatever it may be, they decide to change, and in order to change, you have to understand the truth as to who you are and why you are the way you are and why you're suffering. The answer lies in understanding the truth, and that is usually a long process. Digging through the subconscious mind, digging through your history and your past, digging through your relationships, that takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of time to remove the mental blocks that we might've spent decades developing such that we don't even see these patterns that we play out regularly. \n\n(00:26:51):\nSo first, you begin with suffering, and then second, you seek the truth for your suffering. What I have found, and that leads to step three in the process, is that once you discover the truth of your suffering, the real root cause of it and where it came from, that's when you move to step three, which is you begin to experience and to practice self-compassion and self-love because inevitably, what you discover through this process of seeking the truth is that your suffering isn't necessarily your fault. Maybe you're suffering because of things that you experienced or had to go through of which you had no control over.\n\n(00:27:44):\nNonetheless, it's common for the mind, especially the mind of a child, to interpret those less than nurturing experiences as, \"This happened because of me.\" So what sits at the core of their suffering is not only a low sense of self, but a shame, a shame regarding who they are and who they believe themselves to be. \n\n(00:28:08):\nWhen you dig deep enough into your own self-understanding, eventually you'll discover that that's not true, that it isn't your fault, that these things swept you up like a wave, and you were just along for a ride of which you had no choice. When you understand that and you start to feel a sense of forgiveness and to begin to love yourself for the first time, you make this switch where then you're willing to live in a way that is more consistent with self-love and self-compassion. \n\n(00:28:45):\nSo me, for example, stepping away from my career, at the end of the day, I wasn't running from something, I was running back towards myself. That was an act of kindness towards myself. Going into a 45-day hospitalization, that was an act of love. So what ends up happening is the truth fuels that process of self-love, and when you begin to live in a way that is consistent with valuing yourself and understanding that it's not your fault, then that's when you move to step four, which is compassion towards others because by understanding yourself and realizing the true nature of why you are the way you are and forgiving yourself because you understand it's not your fault, guess what? You see the same thing",

You see the same thing in everybody else. \n\n(00:29:46):\nThis is what is meant when folks sometimes say we're all adults or we're all children walking around in adult bodies, right? We're just acting out the things that were done to us in the past because when I think of the human mind, there are many ways that you can describe what the brain is, but one way that I describe it certainly is that it's autobiographical. It tries to predict what's going to happen next based on what happened in the past. It's a prediction engine. That's what it does, and that's why I say it's autobiographical because the way that you present yourself to the world as an adult is a reflection of what happened to you in the past, the messages you were told, the ways you were conditioned by society, maybe the traumas you experienced. \n\n(00:30:36):\nSo that's the process as I see it of deep, deep, deep transformation. It's that four-step process of the suffering, the seeking of truth, the living in a way that is compassionate towards oneself, and then living in a way that is compassionate towards others. When you do that, you change. Think of that as the horizontal foundation to which the rest of your external life is built. The place you choose to live, the partner you choose to have, the friends you have, the career you have, all of these things are erections on top of a foundation of identity, and that identity is what is completely rewired when somebody goes through that four-step process, and as a result, everything that's built on top of that identity, it doesn't necessarily have to change, but it might.\n\nLenny (00:31:41):\nThat feels like a reason somebody wouldn't want to go down this journey of, \"I don't want to change everything about myself.\"\n\nAndy Johns (00:31:48):\nYes, and this is the power of the human mind at work or what someone referred to as the ego. As soon as the ego senses that something wants to challenge it and to undermine its authority, it finds a way to push it away. It finds a way to ignore it because it is a very difficult process. I now understand what some philosophers described as death before dying. In this process of change that I've been going through, it's been the death of the old me, the death of Andy whose identity was entirely attached to succeeding, and that old Andy doesn't want to let go. It's been around for a few decades. It believes that it's there to protect me. \n\n(00:32:46):\nThis is a survival mechanism that's somewhat gone awry within the context of modern life. So it doesn't want to let go, but that's what I've been doing. That's the process I've been going through is slowly but surely finding a way to take my fingers off the steering wheel and to let that old sense of self die, and then in doing so create the room for what's next, whatever that may be. I'm three years into the process of discovering what that will be. So we'll see.\n\nLenny (00:33:24):\nThinking through these four steps, suffering sounds like people will just do that naturally, potentially, and I feel like it gets hard at the understanding the source of that suffering. I guess, one, is that true or do people try to resist that suffering and are just like, \"Nah, it's okay, it's okay,\" and they white knuckle it?\n\nAndy Johns (00:33:45):\nI think you're pretty spot on with it. This dips into a lot of the ancient Eastern spiritual traditions of just this recognition that life involves suffering. One way or another, there's going to be suffering. I think of it as there's two types of suffering. There's the necessary suffering like we're going to get old and our bodies are going to hurt and we're going to have physical ailments and toothaches and shit's just going to happen and we're going to lose the people we love, all of us, and the 80 to a hundred billion homo sapiens that live before us gone through the same thing. \n\n(00:34:29):\nSo there is necessary suffering in life or the mandatory suffering, and then there's the unnecessary suffering, which is the suffering that is almost entirely, and I think the argument could be made that it's entirely made up in our minds. This is the superpowers of the human mind gone awry again in the modern context. So there's going to be a lot of suffering one way or another. I think if there's a goal or objective, it's to minimize the unnecessary suffering, but the seeking of the truth part is very difficult. It takes years.\n\n(00:35:10):\nThere's a reason that, again, in some of these spiritual traditions, let's take Buddhism for example, there's a reason that there's so much structure and discipline and there's a daily method that they adhere to because it turns out it takes daily practice. In the same way that if you want to get extremely fit and climb Mount Everest, that's not something you do by just getting off the couch, right? It takes a dedication to it. I think that the seeking of truth takes that dedication, and that's, again, why I believe that the first step is almost always suffering because to undergo that process of personal transformation, which can be very difficult, and it can feel like you're in a life raft and you've just pushed away from the shore completely untether",

In order to work up the courage to get to that point, things typically have to get pretty bad.\n\n(00:36:09):\nYou say, \"I can't fucking do this anymore. I'm not going to live like this. Something's got to change.\" So much of that seeking of the truth is actually at first driven by intense fear, fear of going back to how bad things were and feeling that bad again. Eventually, the process changes tone when you move past the fear stage and you understand yourself enough and then you start to look forward optimistically towards the future, where instead of just being driven by fear, you're also pulled forward by a vision for the future that inspires you. So that eventually comes, but to begin with, yes, this process of discovering the truth is very, very, very, very difficult. It requires a personal commitment. It's not something anyone else can do for you.\n\nLenny (00:37:02):\nWith that context in mind that it's very difficult, I imagine many people listening are like, \"Yes, I have a lot of suffering that I'm going through. Life is hard, work is hard, work is too crazy,\" especially product managers and founders that listen to this podcast.\n\nAndy Johns (00:37:19):\nI know. To all the VPs of Product out there, I'm so sorry. I've been in your shoes.\n\nLenny (00:37:24):\nSo with that, say someone wanted to go down this path and understand the truth of what is the source of this suffering that you even described as unnecessary and made up, what would the first couple steps be of knowing that it's going to take years potentially of how to actually try to understand this?\n\nAndy Johns (00:37:40):\nCommonly in the West, the first step that makes a lot of sense is you turn to somebody who's trained in helping you figure out what those truths are, which is a therapist or a psychologist or a psychiatrist or a counselor. Sometimes people turn to religious or spiritual leaders because they can be quite gifted in this as well. That's the most common step. \n\n(00:38:02):\nThat's the first step that I turn to when I was just completely stricken by panic and terrified that I might harm myself. I said, \"I got to figure out what the hell's going on because I can't live feeling like this,\" and all I knew to do was reach out to a therapist, and that is a wonderful first start because if anything, they're not going to have all the answers, but they can act like a router, where as they're helping you understand yourself and they're really understanding you, they're thinking about, \"Okay. Who might this person also benefit from speaking with? Let's route them to this person that specializes in body-based work, somatic work. Let's send this person to somebody that specializes in nervous system management through breath work or other things.\" So seeking a therapist is a pretty good first step.\n\nLenny (00:39:00):\nAny advice on how to figure out who the right therapist or wrong therapist is for you? I know you've actually shared somewhere on LinkedIn once that there's also a lot of disagreement within the mental health community of what is the right approach and what's the right solution.\n\nAndy Johns (00:39:13):\nIt's like speed dating at first because I would argue that the most important factor is that you feel safe. Animals can teach us so much about what it means to heal ourselves. Imagine going to the pound and you go in there and there's a bunch of dogs that have been picked up off the street or that have been abandoned, and the vast majority of them, they're a nervous wreck, right? Their tail is down in between their legs. They're hunched over and they might be shaking. Their nervous system is completely overwhelmed. That is not the time to teach a dog tricks. When the dog still can't come out the corner of the kennel is not the time to teach it how to sit. Once that dog can make it into the arms of an owner that it feels safe with and loved by, that's when you see the dog transform and change, and that's when you can teach it a lot because it's open and receptive to it.\n\n(00:40:21):\nSo that's number one in my advice is speed date if you've got the opportunity to and try out a few therapists and just go based on intuition, what just feels right to you, and you're going to want to fall into that feeling of comfort. Now, a quick asterisk on that. Of course if you're in real distress, if you're in a bad place, just see whatever professional you can as soon as possible. That's what I did. I was fortunate to where the first one that I saw was also fantastic. I ended up seeing many other specialists over the years, but that first one, she was wonderful.\n\n(00:41:05):\nSo it's essential that you feel comfortable with them. I would also say, this one's a little controversial, but you're going to want a therapist that is at least as intelligent, if not more intelligent than you because I think part of that openness to learning from them and to feeling somewhat comfortable but also feeling inspired and looking forward to it as if sometimes they say things that make you say, \"Oh, shit. Wow. Wow, I never thought of that. That was smart",

Wow. Wow, I never thought of that. That was smart,\" or, \"That was a wonderful insight.\" I don't think if you respect their intellectual abilities, then it's going to be difficult for them to help you. They may not be able to communicate on the same wavelength. So you really want to look for that intuitive feeling of something that is safe and comfortable. Ideally, if you can find somebody with some intellectual horsepower that matches your own, honestly, I think the rest after that is just implementation details.\n\nLenny (00:42:11):\nIf someone maybe isn't ready for a therapist and that's something about that just holds them back, is there another route that you would recommend people take or is it just go straight to a therapist?\n\nAndy Johns (00:42:23):\nAbsolutely. Absolutely. If you're not in a state of distress, but you feel like there's something to be figured out, there's an ancient technology known as pen and paper. At the end of the day, the seeking of the truth involves the seeking of a deep sense of self-understanding, and if you can get into the daily practice of being able to sit down with pen and paper and write to yourself, to ask yourself questions, to really sit there and evaluate the thoughts that are running through your head, it is possible for somebody to, and I'll use the term, I won't get into it, but to reach some state of bliss or enlightenment or some real spiritual awakening, it is possible for somebody to do that entirely on their own with just pen and paper and a quiet room. \n\n(00:43:20):\nI know people that have arrived at a deep place of self-love and self-understanding through those methods, and I know a lot of others, including myself, where the writing to others was really the writing to myself 15 years ago as a way for me to continue to understand myself more deeply. So I think pen and paper is deeply, deeply overlooked and underrated in this process.\n\nLenny (00:43:48):\nSay you get a pen and paper, is there some guide or framework or something you'd point people to you to think through what to think about and how to approach this?\n\nAndy Johns (00:43:58):\nYeah. There are different ways of doing it. Some advocate for a completely unstructured approach because what you want is you don't want to turn it into assignment. You want to feel your way into it. If something is bubbling up in your mind, just spit it out. Don't analyze why it's coming up, just allow it to flow. That method certainly works. Sit down with no agenda. On some days you'll write one sentence and that's enough, and on other days you'll write 10 pages and that's also enough. There's some magic to allowing the human mind to just work and to not interrupt it through some analytical process. \n\n(00:44:40):\nOn the flip side, if you want a little bit more structure, one thing you can do is I'd like to start with if the goal is to understand oneself, then one of the quickest ways of doing that is to quickly write down a list of simple bullet points of the most recent situations you can think of where you became most acutely reactionary and emotional. You could have been having a political conversation with somebody and they said something that really just you felt like you just wanted to reach out and strangle them. You could have felt deeply insecure in a social setting. \n\n(00:45:24):\nJust run through those scenarios where something disrupted what might've been your current state of presence and calmness. When you identify those situations where there was some strong reaction, that is very revealing because that wasn't a conscious thought process that led to the reaction. That was a knee-jerk reaction. That was a reflex. If there's a reflex, then there's something that's underlying the reflex, and the question to then ask is, \"Why did that happen?\" \n\n(00:45:58):\nThen from there, it's an unstructured process. Keep asking, keep digging, keep asking, \"Okay. If this happened, why did that happen? Well ...\" and then write a little bit, \"Well, is that really the reason why? Was there something else?\" Just keep working at it until you hit the truth, and you'll know what the truth is because it always feels either deeply uncomfortable or it feels like an epiphany.\n\nLenny (00:46:26):\nWow. For you that was recognizing that it was about your mom.\n\nAndy Johns (00:46:32):\nThere were many parts of it. At its core, at first it began with a simple truth, which was I went into the therapist, I was describing what I was feeling, I was describing the uncontrollable thoughts and mental imagery that I was experiencing, and my sleep disruption, and my pounding heart, and everything else, and she said, \"Yup, you're having panic attacks,\" and just knowing like, \"Oh, there's a thing and it's called a panic attack,\" starting at that basic truth was enough in the moment to just take a little bit of the edge off. \n\n(00:47:18):\nSo this journey along the way is there are dozens of truths and then hundreds of truths, and then every now and then it's punctuated by the big, \"Oh, holy shit. I never saw that coming,\" kind of truth. It's just what the experience is. I had many",

I never saw that coming,\" kind of truth. It's just what the experience is. I had many, many truths about myself that I discovered before I hit some of the fundamental ones that were at the core of my subconscious.\n\nLenny (00:47:48):\nFollowing in that thread, what are signs that you're in need of this transformation versus, \"Work is just stressful. Things are hard. I have some challenging meetings,\" which a lot of people go through on and off? I've had a lot of those. What are signs maybe you're boarding out or something that requires, \"Wow, I really need to dig a lot deeper\"?\n\nAndy Johns (00:48:09):\nThere are day-to-day stresses that are normal and we just have to put up with, but then there's the other stuff that's the flashing red alarm. For me, and a lot of the research and literature supports this too, is, again, you can go back to animals. It's like when their fundamental functions, when their core behaviors of diet, exercise, playfulness, socialization, sleep, when those things get disrupted, it's a sign that there is something going on here that you need to take a look at. \n\n(00:48:49):\nSo the same is true with people. If your sleep always sucks, if your relationships are constantly strained or frequently strained, if your physical health is failing, there's so many ways that that can be measured so there's really no excuse for that to say, \"Oh, I just didn't know,\" I'd say it's to look at those things. When those are suffering or when they're really out of whack, it's undeniable that there is something that is detrimental to your wellbeing that's going on right now, and your body is telling you, \"Stop. Something needs to change.\" So that is number one to look at. Look at the fundamentals.\n\n(00:49:43):\nReflecting on my own situation, I almost had a heart attack at 35, and I got the classic talk from a Stanford cardiologist saying, \"You're just going to be another 40-something-year-old CEO with a broken heart.\" The years of really poor sleep, the number of teeth that I had broken that I had to have fixed multiple times because for years my grinding was so bad that I had to, now two times over, had to completely redo all the teeth, all my molars, and then most of the front teeth as well, and I just continued to move forward even though my body was, again, throwing out all the signals.\n\n(00:50:31):\nFor anyone who's listening to this, especially for the folks who haven't, go get the book, The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk. He's a expert clinician who's worked with trauma patients for decades, and the entire book is basically one big message saying, \"Hey, when mental health presents itself, look to the body because it's the body that is keeping the score.\" It's the body that's the scoreboard, and it's the body that is actually holding on to all of this shit you've been carrying for years, and eventually, the body breaks in the form of chronic disease and illness and so on and so forth.\n\nLenny (00:51:12):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. The best way to see what Miro is all about and how it can help your team collaborate better is not to listen to me talk about it, but to go check it out for yourself. Go to miro.com/lenny. With the help of the Miro team, I created a super cool Miro board with two of my own favorite templates, my one pager template and my managing up template that you can plug and play and start using immediately with your team. I've also embedded a handful of my favorite templates that other people have published in the Miroverse. When you get to the board, you can also leave suggestions for the podcast, answer a question that I have for you, and generally just play around to get a sense of how it all works.\n\n(00:51:56):\nMiro is a killer tool for brainstorming with your team, laying out your strategy, sharing user research findings, capturing ideas, giving feedback on wireframes, and generally just collaborating with your colleagues. I actually used Miro to collaborate with the Miro team on creating my own board, and it was super fun and super easy. Go check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's M-I-R-O dot com slash Lenny. \n\n(00:52:22):\nWe've talked about the suffering step, then the understanding the truth of what is going on. Say someone sits down in a room, writes out what's going on, has this epiphany of, \"Oh, wow, it's really this moment in my childhood that really led me to need to achieve and do all these things.\" The next step is self-compassion and recognizing that it's not your fault. That sounds very easy on the surface like, \"Okay. I understand this is not my fault.\" I know it's not that easy. How do you go about actually deeply doing that steps?\n\nAndy Johns (00:52:56):\nIt's likely this deeply internalized self-belief. You can think of that as one of the deepest grooves in the neural pathways in your mind. Now, that was the case for me, so deep that you don't even realize that it's there, it's omnipresent",

You can think of that as one of the deepest grooves in the neural pathways in your mind. Now, that was the case for me, so deep that you don't even realize that it's there, it's omnipresent. It's going to take time to rewire that because what you're effectively trying to do is take an internal narrative and edit and rewrite that thing, and this internal narrative is probably at a foothold in you for years or decades. So it's reasonable to believe or to understand that, \"Okay. If I have not had a high opinion of myself for 30 years, that's not going to change overnight.\" \n\n(00:53:50):\nFor some people, it miraculously does. That's not the norm. For most others, including myself, it starts with that truth stage because with truth is the awareness, \"Okay. I understand that I have a low sense of self-worth, and I understand that it plays out in all these ways, and I have the awareness of it that now when I'm doing something that is a conditioned behavior or a conditioned response born out of that deep self-belief or that negative core belief, then when I spot it, there's an opportunity for me to intervene,\" and it starts in the simple ways. \n\n(00:54:31):\nFor example, I had a boss once where he would come over and he would give me praise all the time. He was wonderful human being, and I think I was doing a good job. One day, he swung by, he said, \"Hey, amazing job,\" and my response was, \"Oh, yeah, I did my best,\" and then he looked at me and he said, \"Hey, say thank you or you're welcome. That's it. When somebody gives you a compliment, just say thanks, accept it.\" So it's become a pattern of mine now that if somebody gives me a compliment, I look them in the eyes and I say, \"Thank you,\" and I really try and embrace that little moment because it's in all of those ways where you identify these little patterns, you intercept them, and you choose to make a change to how you're conditioned to behave in that moment. If you do that consistently enough and you keep practicing it, and you keep it up every day, then you're developing a new internal narrative through all those little actions, and it accumulates in ways that are pretty powerful. \n\n(00:55:43):\nEvery now and then, there's things that you can do that are more of a brute force method of driving that home. Some may find it through a Vipassana retreat, a seven to 10-day silent retreat, which is agonizing if folks haven't tried to be that quiet that long. Things bubble up, you confront the stuff in your mind that in our day-to-day, it's easy to just keep it under the hood. Some find that through psychedelics. Some find that through somewhat extreme physical feats. \n\n(00:56:22):\nThere was a period in time where I didn't realize this at the time, but not only was I building my career, but I was running ultra marathons. Looking back at that I was like, \"Yeah, there I was, another desperate attempt to feel worthy,\" but I also recognize now that that was medicine for me, that me going out onto a remote mountain range for five hours every Saturday and just running well beyond the point of discomfort was consistently cathartic for me. I would cry at the end of almost every single one of those runs. So it's just a recap. It's in those little moments and sometimes in those big moments too, but it begins with the awareness based on truth and then the daily practice.\n\nLenny (00:57:17):\nHow long does this process often take for people that you've worked with?\n\nAndy Johns (00:57:21):\nThere are some famous figures that you can turn to. For example, Eckhart Tolle. He wrote The Power of Now, which he's probably most famous for. He's a great Western spiritual teacher of Eastern traditions. He went through immense suffering himself. Actually, the suffering was so great that for him it led to a somewhat sudden and spontaneous collapse of his sense of identity. Doctors would probably say psychosis, and what he actually had was a spiritual liberation, liberation from his mind, but he describes it himself. In reading his book and listening to some of his lectures and talking about his own journey, he wrote this at, I think, in the first chapter or the preface of The Power of Now when he described the suffering that he was experiencing and the sudden collapse of this sense of identity, and then waking up the next day and feeling this deep sense of peace and freedom for the first time in his life.\n\n(00:58:28):\nThen his journey continued to unfold. He eventually started to research to try and understand, \"What had just happened to me? What experience did I have?\" and dot, dot, dot. Seven years later, he woke up one day and realized he was now a spiritual teacher, seven years. It's not that the journey had ended, but to use a metaphor of two mountains and a valley, that first mountain in his life when he got off of that mountain and he entered this valley, between the first mountain of life and the second mountain of life, the valley that he was in that sat between the old sense of self and then this new sense of self as a spiritual teacher, that valley was seven years for him. \n\n(00:59:22):\nThere are many other examples I can pull up like that, including Siddh",

That wasn't a couple weeks or a couple of months, his journey towards liberation from his own mind. If I can recall, that was also a seven or eight-year journey. So these big shifts on a cosmic universal scale, it's instantaneous, right? On the scale of-\n\nLenny (00:59:50):\n[inaudible 00:59:50] context.\n\nAndy Johns (00:59:50):\nYeah. On the scale of 13 billion years, it's instant, but from our perspective, it's not. It feels a lot longer than that.\n\nLenny (01:00:00):\nI want to close the loop on these four steps that you shared, and the one we haven't talked about yet is the last one, which is building compassion towards others. How do you go about that just broadly? I know we're not going to solve that problem for people in the podcast.\n\nAndy Johns (01:00:14):\nFor me, my experience was that it happened automatically. When you do the first three, it is the result. It's the thing that comes out of step number three itself because, again, when you dig deep enough and you keep searching for the truth, you're like Captain Ahab going down with the white whale in Moby Dick. That is what that book is about. It's not about a fisherman going after a whale. This is the author himself through a story talking about his own journey of emotional and spiritual liberation. \n\n(01:00:57):\nThere are many people that would, experts and historians that might disagree with that, and I would disagree with them that it's a story of seeking the truth at all costs to liberate oneself, including being willing to die for that whale, metaphorically, because at the end of the book, they don't really reveal. Did Ahab actually go down with the whale and never come back? Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. \n\n(01:01:27):\nSo when you have suffered enough and the search for the truth becomes the only thing that matters and that truth leads you to understanding that, \"It's okay. I can accept myself for who I am and it's not all my fault,\" when that has been done in earnest and when you feel those moments of love for yourself, it suddenly changes how you see everybody else. For me, step four was the easiest because it just happened. It happened after eight years, nine years of my own on and off mental health journey, but it finally happened.\n\nLenny (01:02:19):\nPeople who are listening to this say they're a VP of Product and they're like, \"I don't want to become a spiritual teacher. I want to stay on this path. I want to have a successful career. I want to continue to make a bunch of money.\" How often do you find there's a path to stay on that path with a rejiggering of how you see the world or does it, if you're suffering enough, does it almost always lead to something completely different in your experience?\n\nAndy Johns (01:02:46):\nAgain, it's a spectrum. What I've experienced is that the vast majority of people who feel some tug to undergo a process of change, I'd say 90%, 95% of the time pretty confidently I can say that those changes are more of the micro transitions. It's, \"Okay. Let me change my job. Let me downsize my house. Let me break up with my partner.\" Still hard things, and for them, that may be all that is needed and necessary. There's no moral judgment on my side about everyone's got to dive into the deep end. That's certainly not the case, and I'm not advocating for it. I honestly don't even know if it's a choice. There's a part of me that, based on some of the experiences I've had, believes that it was somewhat preordained and that this was going to happen for me, but it's in the minority of cases where the radical transformation of one's sense of identity takes place. It's not common. My general sense is it's definitely less than 1% of the population, and I suspect that's just the way things are.\n\nLenny (01:04:11):\nOne of those ends up being Buddha, and one of those ends up being Andy Johns.\n\nAndy Johns (01:04:16):\nYeah, or another popular figure in Western spirituality is Pema Chödrön, who she's got a lot of great books. One of them is titled When Things Fall Apart, some of the first books I read when things fell apart for me. Her story, actually, she used to live in Berkeley, I think, but an American woman. She was married. First marriage didn't work out. She got married again. Second one didn't work out. It ended in somewhat sudden and expected and catastrophic fashion. Here she is with a few children and a broken heart again and deep emotional suffering, and that suffering was so great that it led her to ultimately say, \"I must pursue these teachings and this spiritual tradition that I'm starting to wake up to in the Eastern traditions,\" with Buddhism in particular because she had suffered so much that she needed to find liberation from that.\n\n(01:05:25):\nIn her case, that even meant separating, not all the time, but a significant portion of her time away from her own children who, if I recall correctly,",

Now, I think that Pema Chödrön is the only female Buddhist nun in all of North America and is a very well-known spiritual teacher. I also think her journey was somewhere around seven or eight years. Again, that's just the valley between two mountains. Truthfully, the journey continues for the rest of your life, but just another example I wanted to share.\n\nLenny (01:06:06):\nThere's some obvious reasons why going down this path is difficult, why making change is hard. What else would you say holds people back from making a big change in their life, and maybe on the flip side is just how do you allow change to happen?\n\nAndy Johns (01:06:20):\nA significant thing that holds people back from change is the inertia of civilization because we all experience a fundamental conflict in our life because when we're born, we have many needs, but there are two substantial needs that are immutable in everyone, especially children. The first need is the need for love, acceptance, and connection for mammals. We have one of the longest gestation periods of the entire animal kingdom, and even when we're born, we're helpless, we can't survive. We need nurturing for many, many more years afterwards in order to survive. \n\n(01:07:13):\nThat goes hand-in-hand with our need for connection. So we're biologically hardwired to need to be accepted and connected because it is perhaps the most essential thing to survival, more essential than water. So we're born with that need. Yet at the same time, we're also born as unique individuals. \n\n(01:07:37):\nI read a study where the scientists estimated the probability that two sperm or two egg would be genetically identical. For context, I think the average man generates in their prime somewhere around between 10 to 100 million sperm a day. So we generate a lot of sperm in our lifetime. The math that they came up with was that the probability of two sperm being identical is roughly 10 to the 15th power, which is a million times greater than the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy. There's somewhere between 100 to 400 billion stars in the galaxy. So it's a million times greater than that. So all that is to say is when you were born, you were unique. There's never been a you before ever, and it's going to be a really, really long time or another dimension before another one of you shows up again. \n\n(01:08:32):\nThen further through the socialization of life, we all have unique experiences, and those experiences are passed through this unique prism of our own mind and genetics to where we're further accentuated as individuals. So we're born with this fundamental need to be connected and to be loved, but we're also born with this need to be ourselves and to express ourselves. What ends up happening though is the world that you're born into eventually conditions you away from the unique individual that you were, and that is the function of society. \n\n(01:09:09):\nSociety operates because enough people choose to agree on the same beliefs and ideas around the style of education, of raising children, of city planning, of millions of things. So the substrate of society or the adhesive of it is shared belief. So that's why I say the inertia of civilization or I should have said the inertia of society is because you're born into a world that begins to condition you at a very early age to act a certain way and not act a certain way, believe some things and don't believe others. \n\n(01:09:48):\nWhy am I a San Francisco Giants fan? Well, because I grew up in a Giants family. It's not like I was two years old and I picked the Giants. It doesn't work that way. What ends up happening then is, and this begins, again, really young. You're two, three, four, five years old and the world around you, namely the adults in the world, start telling you who to be, and it begins to challenge or run into conflict with that individuality, but because our fear of not being accepted and loved is so great that what do we end up doing? We choose to push down our individuality in exchange for being accepted by the pack, beginning with our parents, and then our friends, and then our teachers, and then our bosses, and all of the other dimensions of society. \n\n(01:10:42):\nSo we lose who we were before the world told us who to be. It's actually a Carl Jung quote, \"The world will ask you who you are, and if you don't know, it'll tell you.\" So I would say that that is the number one reason why transformation doesn't take place. It's because a long time ago, we made that exchange to forego our individuality in order to be accepted by others because of that deep primal need for love and acceptance. In order to undertake that process of personal transformation, one of the truths you have to realize is that truth, that truth that you are in large part the way you are but because of what the world told you to be, and it's making the choice consciously to then say, \"Fuck that, and I'm going to go against the grain and I'm going to now tell the world that I don't want its influence on me anymore, and I will, like Moby Dick or like Ahab going down with",

The simple thing is you could say fear, but what is the fear? That is the fear. It's to say, \"I'm going to walk my own path now and I'm going to be who I want to be, and I'm going to discover who I was before the world told me who to be, and by doing so, I run the risk that I'm not going to be accepted anymore.\" That's terrifying.\n\nLenny (01:12:44):\nBecause it's so terrifying, I imagine that's why the suffering is so important to really feel that because, otherwise, why would you go down that path? It feels very hard.\n\nAndy Johns (01:12:57):\nYeah, and that gets to my point earlier around I'm not entirely convinced that this is an act of free will on my part. There have been moments of me intervening and acting with free will, but I believe that there are also undercurrents that would fall into the realm of superstition for a lot of folks that this is the path that was laid out in front of me even before I was born.\n\nLenny (01:13:29):\nAlong those same lines, you wrote in one of your writings that at the end of the day, you're on your own to find what ends up alleviating your psychological suffering. Can you speak to that?\n\nAndy Johns (01:13:41):\nYeah. That really ties in with this point of the uniqueness of people. You have to find what works for you. For some people, it's going to be the ice bath thing. For others it's not. Last year, a quick anecdote, I spent a month working at an animal sanctuary in northern Thailand for abused animals and neglected animals. This place is amazing. They take in anything and they say, \"We'll find a way,\" and that's what they do. So they have hundreds and hundreds of animals, including a large herd of elephants, which is pretty amazing. \n\n(01:14:24):\nThere was a worker there who I met, and just by the expression on his face, I could tell that this was a liberated man. This was somebody who had figured out something that was contributing to his deep sense of peace. So I went to talk with him. I said, \"Hey, something tells me that you figured out the secret to life and I'd like to chat.\" So we talked, and it turned out that half the time he was a farmer, he had a small little farm, an acre up on a hill in the mountains, and he'd work at his farm half the time and the other half he would then go and work at the animal sanctuary, and he was a practicing Buddhist. \n\n(01:15:15):\nOne of the things he said to me really stood out. He used a simple analogy. He said, \"Everyone's trying to make it to Bangkok. The problem is they're getting to Bangkok by following somebody else's road. The whole point is to find your own path to Bangkok.\" He was making that same point or a similar point of you've got to find your own way. That is the message. For me, I take that as maybe the most fundamental message in looking back at the story of the original Buddha himself was, sure, the teachings, the traditions, everything that's formed around his teachings has power and merit to it, but I look at what he did. He was born as a prince into a royal family. Something wasn't right, and he was seeking the truth behind this anguish and this unfulfillment, and there was something inside of him that said, \"I must seek the answer because growing up in this sheltered life as a prince, this can't be the answer.\" \n\n(01:16:31):\nSo he left it all behind, including his wife and child, and then he lived as an aesthetic for years, nearly dying close to starvation. He did that for years. Then eventually he realized, \"Well, that's not the answer either.\" Then he famously made his way to the Bodhi tree and sat under it and meditated for 40, 41 days. I can't recall what it was, a long time. Then he had his enlightenment, and out of that came one of the teachings, which is known as the middle way. It's not about being a prince, it's not about being poor. There's something in between. He found that was his path to Bangkok. You could walk that path and maybe it'll teach you something or it'll lead you nowhere because it's not your own path. I think that's the point.\n\nLenny (01:17:32):\nAndy, what a beautiful way to wrap up our conversation. Before we do, is there anything else you want to share that you want to leave listeners with? Then also, I'm just curious how you're doing these days.\n\nAndy Johns (01:17:44):\nSure, sure. Well, let me answer the first one, a message to leave to folks. I would imagine that there's a lot of high performers, successful folks out there. Some of you, you may feel like you're on the verge of answering",

I would imagine that there's a lot of high performers, successful folks out there. Some of you, you may feel like you're on the verge of answering a call towards a new chapter in life or towards finding a way out of whatever situation you're in that you don't want to be in anymore. The thing I guess I would say to you is that having undergone some change myself, all I can promise you is that it's going to be in some ways the best thing that's ever happened to you, but also the worst thing that's ever happened to you, but those are the experiences that define a life. \n\n(01:18:36):\nIf you feel that call inside of you to seek a new way of living, just know that you're not the only one out there doing it. There are others out there such as myself and that I can always be reached. So I wish you a happy journey and just know that things are going to be okay. Now, the second question, what am I up to nowadays? Is that-\n\nLenny (01:19:03):\nHow are you doing? How are you doing on this journey?\n\nAndy Johns (01:19:06):\nI'm good. I still have my ups and downs. I've arrived at an interesting part in my journey where it's something that I'm practicing now and I still don't quite have the hang of it. I'll use one more metaphor. I think the way that I approached the first part of my life was as if life was a big mountain to be climbed, where you're trying to head up Everest under this assumption that once you get to the top, you're going to have this bliss that will persist or that will make you feel that you had a life well-lived, and that that was the answer, but what I experienced was that once I got to the top of one mountain, then I had to find the top of another and another and another. Although you see and do some amazing things along the way, at some point it's too exhausting. At some point, you may really get yourself into trouble and you might not survive. \n\n(01:20:13):\nThe vast majority of people who die on Mount Everest actually die on the way down, not on the way up. You don't save anything for the return home, I think is the point. Instead of pursuing my life now as a mountain to be climbed in the hopes that reaching the top will make me feel good again, I'm instead trying to float down river. So for example, if you go whitewater rafting, they'll give you a little safety crash course at the beginning. They'll say, \"Here's how you paddle. Put your vest on.\" One of the things they'll ask you is, what do I do if I fall overboard, especially if I fall overboard into the rapids or the cold water? This is maybe the most important thing they teach because commonly what happens if you're in sizable enough rapids and you fall overboard, the tendency is to freak out and to fight the current. When people freak out in the water, especially when the water's choppy, that's when they get in trouble. \n\n(01:21:20):\nThe thing they teach you to do is instead you go into mummy mode, right? You lay back, you cross your arms across your chest, and you stick your feet out like you're a mummy, and you do the opposite of fighting the current. You allow the current to take you where it's trying to take you. For me, I actually find that I believe that that's a more fitting metaphor for life. It's possible that there's something amazing for us downstream so long as we're willing to surrender and just let go, to turn off the intellectual mind a bit, to quit trying to plan as if you can predict the future, to quit thinking about all the edge cases and trying to optimize our life, which I think is a bunch of bullshit. It's possible that if you just relax and you instead pay attention to the signals around you, you feel where the current is trying to take you, maybe towards a potential life partner, maybe away from an oppressive work environment, maybe towards a place to live that is more calm and peaceful, whatever it may be. \n\n(01:22:33):\nIf you really tune in with yourself and pay attention to that current and you relax into it, you'll arrive at a destination that you were meant for. In a sense, that's what I did that has brought me to this conversation today. Instead of talking about investing in companies and what have you, I'm instead trying to connect with people on an entirely different level and help them make their own way downstream, so to speak. \n\n(01:23:11):\nSo for me nowadays, that's how I'm living at the moment. I'm actually in Vietnam. Just got here about 10 days ago because it seemed like the current of life was taking me here right now. It's likely that it's just the next lily pad towards wherever else I'm heading to, but I guess I'm in the mindset now where I'm willing to just surrender and see how it unfolds.\n\nLenny (01:23:35):\nThe metaphor for that is they lost your luggage on the way to Vietnam, and we had to push back this recording a week.\n\nAndy Johns (01:23:41):\nYeah, that's right, that's right. My luggage was half a world away from me, and so when that happened, what could I do? I just said, \"Okay. Well, I have shorts and a shirt on me that I can wear for the next three or four days,\"",

Andy, I think this might end up being one of the most meaningful episodes of the podcast. I think it's going to end up being a Trojan horse for people are coming here for advice on optimizing their product and growth, and they'll opt up rethinking their whole life, hopefully in a good way, maybe cause some suffering, maybe help people through suffering. Thank you, Andy, so much for being here. Two final questions. You said people could reach out if they're going down this path and maybe need some help or advice. So what's the best way for people to reach out, and then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAndy Johns (01:24:31):\nSure, a couple ways. You can find me on Twitter, my username is Clues Dot Life, so C-L-U-E-S-D-O-T-L-I-F-E. You can also find me on LinkedIn, search for Andrew Johns, you'll find me on there. You can check out my website Clues.Life. It's a basic MVP, but it's an art project that's in process. So those are a couple of ways that you can reach out. In terms of ways you can help, you can't always tell who you're helping. When I sit behind my laptop and I write and I send my messages out into the world, other than getting some thumbs up here and there, you don't always know what impact you're having. \n\n(01:25:22):\nSometimes it's good to hear because, again, for me, this is part of me rewriting that internal narrative where I'm trying to do more work for the benefit of others as opposed to what it does for my bank account. So if part of this message has been beneficial to you, it would certainly put wind in my sails to hear that. So that would be one way to help.\n\nLenny (01:25:50):\nWhat a great answer. So let's blow up the YouTube comments and send you some DMs and LinkedIn messages if people find this valuable. Andy, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nAndy Johns (01:26:02):\nLenny, I appreciate it, man. Thank you.\n\nLenny (01:26:04):\nBye, everyone. \n\n(01:26:07):\nThank you so much for listening.

If we served customers well, if we prioritized customers and delivered for them, things like sales, things like revenue and active customers and things like the share price and free cash flow would follow. So therefore, when we're making a decision thinking about a problem, we're going to start with what's best for the customer and then come backward from there. That informs what's the work you have to do to then create this new solution for customers.\n\nLenny (00:00:33):\nToday my guest is Bill Carr. Bill is the co-author of the book Working Backwards, which is a synthesis of the biggest lessons that Bill and his co-author learned from their many years at Amazon. Bill joined Amazon just five years after it was founded, stayed there for 15 years where he worked on the books business, and then as VP of Digital Media, launched and managed the company's global digital music and video businesses, including Amazon Music, Prime Video, and Amazon Studios. After Amazon, Bill was an executive in residence at Maveron, an early stage VC firm, then chief operating officer at OfferUp. And these days, Bill runs a consulting firm called Working Backwards, LLC, where he and his co-authored, Colin Breyer, help growth stage and public companies implement the many practices developed at Amazon.\n\n(00:01:20):\nIn our conversation, we go many levels deep on how to actually implement a number of the practices and ways of working that helped Amazon become the success that it is today, including the process of how to actually work backwards, how to organize your team with a single-threaded leader, how to divide up your metrics into input and output metrics, how to practice disagreeing and committing, how to implement the Bar Raiser program in your hiring process and so much more.\n\n(00:01:47):\nHuge thank you to Ethan Evans for making this episode possible and introducing me to Bill. With that, I bring you Bill Carr, after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:58):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Assembly AI.

You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it altogether and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.\n\n(00:03:45):\nIf your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups.

Thanks so much for having me. Pleasure to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:32):\nIt's my pleasure. So, I was reading your book, and something that I recognized as I was going through this is just how many new ways of working Amazon contributed to the way tech and business runs. And I made this little list, and I'm curious if there's anything I'm forgetting that's obvious. So, obviously the idea of working backwards, the idea of one way and two way door decisions, the concept of disagreeing and committing input and output metrics using memos versus decks, just the idea of two pizza teams, and then I know that evolved into single-threaded leaders. Is there anything else that's just like an obvious core thing that's maybe almost too obvious that I don't even think about that Amazon contributed?\n\nBill Carr (00:05:10):\nThe one that's non-obvious and is really the way in which Amazon created a set of leadership principles that were very real, and the way in which Amazon created a set of processes to reinforce them. I think I certainly haven't encountered anything",

I think I certainly haven't encountered anything quite like that. It was very intentional. So, that is also a distinctive element of that we try to point out in our book.\n\nLenny (00:05:42):\nAwesome. Okay. So, maybe we will come back to that, because that is also really powerful mechanism. So, the question I wanted to ask about this is there are companies that are bigger than Amazon, that are more successful than Amazon, that have been around longer than Amazon, but I don't think any other company has contributed so many unique, new ways of working and also been able to coin them into such shareable ways. What would you say it is about Amazon that enables this sort of way of working and also just making things so just proliferate through the culture?\n\nBill Carr (00:06:13):\nThat's actually one of the reasons why Colin and I set out to write our book because everyone knows about Amazon as a innovative product company, at least certainly during the time I was there, which was from 1999 through the end of 2014. The company rolled out all kinds of innovative products. The Kindle, AWS, Alexa, Echo, the Prime subscription itself is innovative and...\n\nLenny (00:06:41):\nAnd it's all those things, by the way.\n\nBill Carr (00:06:43):\nYes, a lot of people around the world use all those things. And obviously, Jeff was a huge driver of those things. But what people don't realize is that Amazon was actually, to some degree, equally focused on process innovation. In many cases, by the way, we stood on other people's shoulders, we cannot take credit for having... For most of these, there were other inspirations or we built on work that others had done, which by the way, was what I think all great companies should do. And again, that's also why we wrote the book was because we would like to allow people to stand on Amazon's shoulders to learn what we learned, and then take all or part of these things and build from there.\n\n(00:07:28):\nBut to more directly answer your question, how or why did this happen. So, this period of both product and process innovation actually occurred in this one narrow window of 2003 to 2007. During that window of time, all of the products I just mentioned and all of the processes except for one were all developed in this one four year period.\n\nLenny (00:07:53):\nWow.\n\nBill Carr (00:07:54):\nAnd this is the period actually where we were going from hypergrowth stage, zero to one company, to what I would call one to whatever, a thousand, infinity. That next step that companies have to make where what happens is things become very complex. We're no longer just a bookstore, we sell a lot of things. We actually branched out beyond just a retail business, we had a third party marketplace business. We were experimenting in those days with providing running websites for third party retailers in those days too. We were developing new things. We were in many countries around the world. So, we'd become very complex. And what happens to that point is that then you reach this point where the CEO can no longer be in every important meeting, can no longer be involved with hiring every person. And you need a system, a method to run the company effectively. And Jeff Bezos is fundamentally, he's a very scientific and analytical thinker.\n\n(00:09:07):\nHis undergraduate degree was in computer science, I'm pretty sure. Although I think he actually started off wanting to get a physics degree, he ended up moving over to computer science. He spent his early days at DE Shaw as a quant on Wall Street. Very quantitative mind. So, he applied this... When he thought about this problem, he said, \"Well, I need to be scientific about this. There needs to be some system or some approach, some mechanism for me to be able to manage such a company. So, I'm going to experiment, like a scientist would, with different ideas, different hypotheses, implement them and see what works, and iteratively improve.\" So that was the mindset which we took... Which by the way, we applied both to process innovation, but also product innovation.\n\nLenny (00:09:55):\nAwesome. I had Eric Reson, and he also happened... I thought about this at the same time, he contributed a lot of core concepts to the way tech worked, and he actually brought up a couple concepts that were on the cutting room floor, basically things that he thought would be things people adopt everywhere. And I'm curious, is there an example of that at Amazon where you built a process and had this clever term for it and just never spread or never actually worked at Amazon? Anything come to mind?\n\nBill Carr (00:10:20):\nThe dev team, the design team, the product team, they're all in one group, and they'll go operate autonomously, but not completely autonomously because we, the senior leadership team, Jeff and the S-Team want to know that they're on the right track. So, we're going to create something called a fitness function, which was let's figure out what are the four or five or six metrics that matter most for your particular area. Let's give a weighting to all of them and then let's create an index for those, and we'll measure that index up",

    "content": "team, they're all in one group, and they'll go operate autonomously, but not completely autonomously because we, the senior leadership team, Jeff and the S-Team want to know that they're on the right track. So, we're going to create something called a fitness function, which was let's figure out what are the four or five or six metrics that matter most for your particular area. Let's give a weighting to all of them and then let's create an index for those, and we'll measure that index up and down. And that's the fitness function.\n\nLenny (00:10:52):\nThat is a very nerdy way of organizing teams. I love it.\n\nBill Carr (00:10:55):\nYeah, super nerdy. But we realized after, I don't know how long, several months or a year of doing this, so the fitness function was not a good idea. This is what I would describe as a compound metric where you try to take several important metrics and munge them into one. The problem is it's actually becomes totally meaningless. When you're measuring things, you're trying to understand what actions or reactions are creating the good outputs that you want, revenue, customer growth. But by putting them all together, you basically obfuscate that. And what really we realized is we need to just break each one of these out individually and manage them each in its own way. So today, I discouraged teams and companies from creating any sort of compound metrics.\n\nLenny (00:11:44):\nI've done that once, and it was a terrible idea as well, where we had six different metrics and every quarter, we were going to move a different metric that contributed to a higher metric. And what we realized is we just never learn how to get good at one thing, and then it turns out there's always one thing that actually impacts the bigger goal most. See, you just end up working on that thing anyway.\n\n(00:12:03):\nLet's actually go deeper into the single threaded leader piece since you mentioned it. It's actually come up a lot on this podcast of people working this way where they have a single threaded leader. And so clearly, it's worked. And I guess we'll just help people understand what does a single threaded leader actually mean, and then why is it such an effective way of working.\n\nBill Carr (00:12:23):\nSo, the concept of single-threaded leadership was first... When I was born from this time of complexity at Amazon, and where again, large... Once you get to a certain scale, you get to a point of where there are competing departments, competing interests, and they're competing for some centralized pool of resources. For all of you who are working for a tech company, this is this pool of engineering resources, or today, data science and AI resources. There may be other constrained resources often designed as a constrained resource. But the point is now all these teams want that pool of resources to go build stuff for them, but they're in competition with each other. So, most companies solve this by having an intense, centralized, highly collaborative process. We decided to go in the other direction for the reasons I mentioned, which were that we're just fine, that we're spending all our time in these meetings, planning, and a lot of the work we were doing, the artifacts we create, the documents, the projections, we're actually not very useful either, we're bureaucratic time wasters largely because a lot of the assumptions built into them were deeply flawed.\n\n(00:13:35):\nSo, you're debating numbers in these documents that are based on flawed assumptions, which is a waste of time. So, what we realized instead was how do we get... The three things we really wanted were ownership, speed and agility. And so, we experimented with that and said, \"Let's create teams that can stand alone, where there's a single leader and the cross- functional resources that they need are all either directly report to them or are dedicated to them.\" So they don't necessarily have to be a straight line direct report. In Amazon's case, for the most part it was. There were some dotted line, but it could be all straight line, it could be all dotted line, it could be a mix of the two. But fundamentally, we've moved from what we called a project orientation to a program orientation.\n\n(00:14:24):\nSo, a project orientation means, oh, we are going to do this project to change our search result page and algorithm, and the project is defined in this way and it's going to take six months. The resources will come and swarm on that, and then they'll move off to some other thing in some other part of the company. The program based orientation says, let's stick with the search example. There's a team that works on search, and they always work on search. And instead of thinking about things on a project by project basis, they think holistically about what they need to do to improve search. They have a set of metrics by which they're looking to drive those metrics largely. Ones that they can control. Things like what percent of the time is a customer clicking on one of the top three results in my search page, or how many milliseconds does it take for the page load time in this browser type, on this device type, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n(00:15:21):\nAnd they then are running their own roadmap. They're deciding what are the most important things for us to go work on, and having a prioritized list of those things and be able to start at the top of the list and work their way down with the pool of resources that they have. Sometimes, and most times, they may want more resources to be able to tackle more, but they spend less time in resource contention, resource fighting, and instead, focus on building what they can build with the resources that they've got.\n\n(00:15",

The only thing they could maybe argue about how they could do better is if they had more resources, which they can petition management for. But this way, it also solves a big management problem, which is instead of management, senior management refereeing every item on a roadmap, they're refereeing which teams have how many resources, which is more of like a once or twice or three times a year decision versus refereeing everything on the product roadmap. And then all the resource contention issues, that's a daily issue. And so, it frees teams up then to actually go and sprint ahead. There's a lot of work you have to do to get ready for this. For example, in a software environment, when we first started and we had a monolithic code base that was not pretty, we weren't ready to do this because you have all those interdependencies.\n\n(00:16:56):\nOnce we moved to a service-based architecture, and then teams could own their code with defined endpoints, APIs that other teams could understand that are well-documented, then we could move in that direction. And the other thing is we had to create, what I would call, countermeasures because there's no free lunch in org structures, any org structure, you're trading off one thing for another thing. In this case, you're trading off potentially functional excellence. So, in other words, if you no longer have every single engineer or every single marketing person or every product person or every biz dev person reporting into a C-level leader of that particular function, and instead, they're spread out in small teams across the company reporting into some generalist who is probably not going to have functional expertise in several of the functions that they're leading, you risk the problem of then the people in those teams not gaining functional competency. That's the downside. And we can talk more about this, but we created a lot of countermeasures to still enable us to have functional excellence while creating these single-threaded teams.\n\nLenny (00:18:07):\nTo drill into this a little bit further, is the origin of this, this recognition at Amazon that the best stuff comes from one person's vision and just one person driving and one person's ask being on the line versus the often, the decision by committee approach?\n\nBill Carr (00:18:24):\nIt is less about that. I do want to be clear, it's one leader and their team who are accountable and responsible. So, with respect to what are we going to go build, how are we going to go measure success, all those things, this team and that leader are responsible for documenting that, writing their plan. Now, they don't just get to go off and do that. There was an intense review process at Amazon where either at some level, whether it be the vice president, senior vice president, or all the way up to the Jeff level and his direct reports called the S-Team, this plan would be reviewed and scrutinized deeply as well, and there'd be a discussion, an interchange, and basically getting alignment between the senior leadership team and each one of these single-threaded teams on that plan before the team could go off and run.\n\n(00:19:17):\nThe beauty of that though is that once we'd had those discussions, those interchanges, then the teams were free to sprint hard after their plan. They didn't have to worry about whether was, \"Am I aligned with my CEO? Am I aligned with my senior vice president?\" They could know that they were. But yes, this creates then clear... If they're going to deliver it or not. It's up to that owner and that team. Whereas when you have this highly cross-functional approach and there's not one clear person who's responsible for this one project that's on this roadmap, I've seen many CEO pull their hair out saying, \"I have no ownership and accountability here. How do I have that?\" They're pushing on a string. Because they can't because their different people and leaders are part owning, half owning a long list of things instead of fully owning a short list of things.\n\nLenny (00:20:15):\nI like that. I like metaphor of pushing on a string. Is this approach similar to just the GM model, or is there a big difference when someone's thinking about going GM model versus the single-threaded leader approach?\n\nBill Carr (00:20:27):\nYeah. Obviously, there are probably different definitions of what people consider the GM model, but I would consider that being this person is a P&L owner, and you can, of course, create mini P&Ls within a P&L. Like for example, in the book business, we could, and I don't know most of the time we didn't do this, but we could have created a P&L owner just for fiction books, or just for professional and technical books, which is a very large category with big differences between the others. And then you say, \"Great.\" Then that team, they have their own dedicated team. They're fully responsible for the revenue numbers and other numbers. But you have to be thoughtful about how you do this because one of the three questions you have to ask when you establish one of these teams is, does the team have the resources within their control to effectively manage this part of this department, this product,",

In other cases, the answer can be yes very easily. A great example, this was in Prime Video, one of the businesses that I managed, we could create a single-threaded team who just was working on applications for TV sets, like Samsung, Sony. We could create another team that's working on game consoles, and another team that's working on mobile phones and tablets. And then within each one of those, we could further break it down. We could have one team working on Xbox and another one on PlayStation, another one just on iOS. In those cases, then it's very clear how you can break the teams down and they can have very clear ownership.\n\nLenny (00:22:06):\nAwesome. Let's go back to the countermeasures topic, and then even just a little more broadly. You talked about one thing that was important to put in place before you moved to the single threaded leader model, which is creating APIs, and basically breaking apart this monolith. What are some other things that you think you need to put in place to be successful in trying to shift to this model?\n\nBill Carr (00:22:26):\nThe other thing was these functional countermeasures. So, let's stick with the engineering, for an example. So, in 2004, 2005-ish, I started managing a single-threaded team. Actually managed two different ones, one for music and one for video, which are now Amazon Music and Prime Video. They weren't called that in those days. But I started managing a small team of software engineers at that point. Well, I have never... Well, I have written lines of code, but that would be back in high school, and we're talking about Basic and Pascal. I have a master's in business, a background in marketing. I'm a generalist, okay? So, I'm not equipped to coach. I couldn't possibly conduct a code review. I couldn't possibly conduct an architectural review. I couldn't possibly coach or mentor an engineer on how to improve their craft. But I was one of many of these examples.\n\n(00:23:28):\nAnd there could be reverse examples where instead of me being a business leader, I was purely an engineer, and now I'm managing a team that does marketing and business development. I wouldn't know anything about those things if that had been my background. So, what we did, and I'll stick with the engineering examples, we came up with various countermeasures. One example was that we still had a C-level leader of engineering in Rick Dalzell, and most of the core infrastructure and core services still reported into Rick. So-\n\nBill Carr (00:24:01):\nCore services still reported in to Rick. So it was things like payments or infrastructure search, and Rick still could be a technical leader for the whole company and he and his team could create things like what are the standard ways that we're going to do code reviews? What are the standard ways across the company that we will interview and screen engineers? What does the promotion process look like? What are the defined steps getting from an SD1 to an SD2, SD3? How do we document and describe what are the requirements? There are many things like this. \n\n(00:24:41):\nEffectively, what it also meant is that anyone who is an engineering vice president, or in many cases a director, they would often have something else beyond their day job of some sort of subject matter expertise area where they would also contribute to the company. A good example of this would be that they might sit on a panel for promotion from a certain level to another level in the engineering world, or they might be available to do code review outside of their organization for another organization. So people had other jobs in addition to their day job to build and maintain functional excellence. There are a lot of examples like this across the company.\n\nLenny (00:25:23):\nLet's go in a different direction and talk about one of my favorite principles of Amazon, which is disagree and commit. I think in the way I even describe it I know is wrong. I think people hear this term and they often use this principle incorrectly. For example, it actually starts with have backbone and then disagree and commit. So I'd love to just hear how you've seen this actually implemented well and what people should do and think about when they're trying to implement something like this at their company.\n\nBill Carr (00:25:49):\nSo when I was at Amazon, there were 10 leadership principles and they've since expanded them. But of those 10, this was always the least well understood when I was at Amazon too, and partly because it is actually the most nuanced and difficult to actually use. So here's what it means. What it means is that have backbone and disagree, meaning when we are making any kind of a decision, important decision, if you are part of that team, part of that unit, it is your obligation to voice your point of view if you disagree with your approach that's been taken. The point of that disagreement, by the way, is to provide usually additional information or a new point of view that people have not considered.\n\n(00:26:40):\nSo I like to geek out a bit on the",

The point of that disagreement, by the way, is to provide usually additional information or a new point of view that people have not considered.\n\n(00:26:40):\nSo I like to geek out a bit on the process of decision-making and have read more and more about this. I think that Peter Drucker probably has the best writing on this topic. But as he would describe it, good decisions are made by first understanding all the different points of view and pros and cons to the potential issue at hand or the potential direction, and that great leaders, what they do is they solicit these different points of views. They have a team that they work with to debate and discuss things. So another way to think about this, a king and their court. In an ideal world, if you assume that there's no political motivations, the court is there to advise the king and help them think through different problems and provide different and opposing points of view to allow the king to arrive at the right decision.\n\n(00:27:41):\nThis is sort of no different than that which is the disagree part is about bringing forth new information, new data, new point of view that would be contrary to the current direction. So that's the disagree part and you're obligated to do it as we would describe sort of all the way up the chain if necessary, if it's an important issue and people are not hearing or understanding your point of view. Now the important point is first of all about hearing and understanding your point of view.\n\n(00:28:11):\nWhat would often happen, I can tell you if someone in a leadership role, someone come to me with a disagreement and many times I'd appreciate it, by the, way because they'd bring some point of view that was useful, but sometimes they bring the disagreement and cite the reasoning behind it and I already knew that reasoning. We'd already thought of that reasoning, we already thought of that, in which case I would say, \"I hear your disagreement. We have already considered that factor. But even though that factor is there, here are these other factors that outweigh that.\"\n\n(00:28:42):\nNow that is the point at which as long as the disagreer is hearing back from the leader that they understand their point of view, understand why they are pushing back and seem to fully understand it, and they've taken that into consideration, that is the point for them to commit. Because the point is you provided your information, they've processed that information and they've decided to go this way with the knowledge of that. Where people get confused about is they don't maybe understand when they're supposed to stop disagreeing is one thing, and so hopefully that explanation made people clear this is when you're supposed to stop, and then the commit part done well means that it's not just like I'm going to commit, I don't really agree with what we're going to do, but I'm going to get behind this.\n\n(00:29:39):\nIdeally it's, oh, now I've heard the argument, I've actually now thought about the argument and hopefully that person has now understood why we're taking that direction. So their commitment is based on that understanding because then they can reflect that understanding back to their organization too. Because the worst thing to do is to say, \"Yeah, we're committed to this. I don't really agree and I still think it's wrong, but I'm committed to it.\" That's not actually commitment. This is really about decision-making and understanding the facts and information that people are going to use to make a decision and then be able reflect that back.\n\nLenny (00:30:22):\nI imagine there are many times I've gone through this where I still don't agree. What's your advice to a manager or to a report of just like, okay, when you actually still don't agree, how do you behave? Do you just behave like, yes, I agree with this and don't really voice your concerns or something else?\n\nBill Carr (00:30:37):\nI work with Jeff on all kinds of different new ideas. Jeff doesn't think a normal person. His level of sort of creativity and the way he thinks, the timescale of which he thinks, there's many ways about the way he thinks that there was no one else in Amazon that thought that way. So there'd be times when even after we've had that discussion, I would maybe still disagree, but then what I would do is I'd focus on, okay, well what is the kernel or the core of why Jeff thinks that we should do this and I would focus on that kernel. I got great advice actually from one of my managers at one point, Steve Kessel who said, \"You have to look for what that is, and then your job is to then take that kernel and try to run with it and expand it and try to see how I can take that idea, that concept, and then make it into something viable.\"\n\n(00:31:41):\nIt doesn't always work, but it's about then having that understanding of what it is, not just sort of going through the motion of stomp, stomp, stomp through it. That's not going to work. Also, I've seen people who try that and their career doesn't go very far. You have to have some degree of faith that there's something there and I'm going to try to do the best I can to make that part. How would I productize that idea? How would I make that viable from a business point of view or whatever the different constraints are.\n\nLenny (00:32:18):\nAwesome. So the advice there is focus on the parts you agree with and think about how you can find out if it's actually right or",

Along the same lines, another principle that I love is leaders are right a lot. I feel like this is a term that it almost goes unsaid. You almost can say this in a lot of companies. I'm curious just the origin of why that became an important principle and then how it's implemented at Amazon.\n\nBill Carr (00:33:03):\nYeah. So going back to this last discussion, so one fallacy we should all acknowledge is that when you're making these decisions, and you're trying to use data to make decisions, you can make the data kind of look however you want it to look to sort of try to meet your decision. If I'm looking at some issue and I've got some big dataset, I can come up with ways of looking at a dataset to support this idea and ways of looking at that dataset to not support it. So the data rarely makes the decision for you. What is happening is then a lot of judgment and interpretation of the data, weighing that, weighing various factors to then come to a decision. \n\n(00:33:49):\nThat is sort of the right a lot part. The right a lot part comes from having what we call sort of sound judgment, which generally come... Some people maybe are born with this, not a lot of them, mostly they get it through experience. A lot of experiences actually about being wrong, by the way, about making mistakes and by having looked at a lot of problems, made decisions or observed others making decisions, being a student of that, and then using that to understand then how to weight different information when making a decision.\n\n(00:34:27):\nSo right a lot is that you're good at that and that then it proves, and that generally speaking, people want to follow someone who ends up by and large going in the right direction, right? You're the leader of a team. The team is petitioning you on multiple sides. If you keep kind of going off in some direction where most of the team is scratching their head saying, \"I don't think that that was the right decision,\" they're not going to want to follow you very far and you're probably not going to go very far. So this is something that you develop through experience and I'd say from having the opportunities to observe and work for others that are good at this.\n\nLenny (00:35:12):\nI love that it's a lot. I like that it's not just leaders are right. It's right a lot.\n\nBill Carr (00:35:18):\nYeah, yeah. No one is right every time. That is totally unrealistic. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:35:26):\nLet's talk about the titular concept of your book, and that's a word I've never used, but I think it's appropriate, which is working backwards. First of all, just what does it actually mean to work backwards versus working forwards?\n\nBill Carr (00:35:37):\nThe title of the book comes from two things. One is one of the leadership principles, which is that customer obsession, and the principle states something along the lines of that great leaders start with the customer's needs and work backwards from there to sort of meet those needs or solve them. Then also because we created a process in this window I was talking about earlier, the 2004 to 2007 window, we created this process for new product innovation called the Working Backwards PR/FAQ process. They both refer to the same idea, which is that as your guiding star or the point from which you're going to start is what are the customer's problems or what are the customer's needs, and then figure out, okay, well what would be the solution to that, what are potential solutions to that? \n\n(00:36:40):\nTo do those things, starting with without the constraints of my financial constraints, my resource constraints, my legal constraints, my engineering constraints, whatever all those constraints may be, because the problem is what most of us do is we start with those constraints and work forward from there, or we start with things like I got to increase revenue. How do I increase revenue? I need to increase active customers. How do I increase active customers? For customer oriented behavior, we tend to start with those things which may often lead you in the wrong direction.\n\n(00:37:22):\nWhereas we had, as Jeff would say, we took it as an article of faith. If we served customers well, if we prioritized customers and delivered for them, we took it as an article of faith that then things like sales, things like revenue and active customers and things like the share price and free cash flow would follow. So this is important because I still can't give you objective proof that that is true, I don't know who could, and so it was saying this is an article of faith that if we do that we think those other things will work out. \n\n(00:37:57):\nSo therefore, when we're making a decision thinking about a problem, we're going to start with what's best for the customer and then come backward from there",

Then in that coming backward process, we're going to have to figure out, well, to do that, gee, I'm going to have to solve this engineering problem, or I'm going to have to figure out how to make this thing cost less or make this thing faster or solve one or more problems. That's the backwards, that informs what's the work you have to do to then create this new solution for customers.\n\nLenny (00:38:36):\nAwesome. So just to summarize, you start with what are the customer's needs and problems, and I think a big part of Amazon's approach is what are the lasting problems they'll always have, which is I think it's lower prices, faster shipping and all those things, and then think with no constraints. When you work with companies to implement this idea of working backwards, is it always what is the customer problem and need versus revenue or growth or something like that? Or is there other examples of where you work backwards from at different sorts of companies?\n\nBill Carr (00:39:07):\nWell, the working backwards part is strictly about the customer's needs. Yeah, we don't want to work backwards from revenue. I guess we didn't really use this term for sort of other things like cost structure. Cost structure was actually a part of working backwards from the customer that if we had a low cost structure, we could afford to give customers lower prices, therefore let's figure out how to have a low cost structure. Because in itself, driving down costs, doing things more efficiently doesn't inherently benefit customers because you could just choose to take more profit. It only does if you decide that in doing so I'm going to lower my prices to customers or provide some other benefit. So no, we used it in this method of I'm starting from the customer, and then very specifically, we used it in this method of new products and features that I'm going to go build on behalf of customers. \n\nLenny (00:40:10):\nAwesome.

Find out more at wix.com/studio. Okay. So then when you go work with a company to implement this idea of working backwards, what are the very tactical things that you do to help them here? I know PR/FAQ is a part of that, so let's chat about how to actually implement that. What are the steps to shift to working backwards?\n\nBill Carr (00:41:31):\nYeah. So the first shift is to take this, so that's just a concept, right? Working backwards. Well, how do I turn that concept into a scalable, repeatable process? That's exactly where Jeff's mind went. Eventually, without getting into the origin story, we came up with this process called the PR/FAQ process. So what it means is that whenever we're devising a new product or feature, we're going to start by writing a press release describing the feature and describing it in a way that speaks to the customer and to some degree the external press and world where the idea is, in my description of this, it better jump off the page of something like, wow, as a customer I will really need this.\n\n(00:42:17):\nSo what I work first is to say, okay, for your product development process, let's start by using this method as the method to decide what am I going to go build? And oh, by the way, to use it as a method to sort between a lot of different choices of what you might build. In summary, the way that process works is that PR, you're going to describe very carefully and clearly who's the customer, what's their problem, and what's the solution that you're planning to build. That sounds really simple and easy, but it's actually very hard to do that well. to crisply and clearly define those. The first two things are the things that are hardest to define, like who's the customer? Like anyone says, \"All restaurants are my customer.\"\n\n(00:43:08):\nOkay, well, that's a mistake. Now, I mean, which kinds of restaurants are your customers? In what kinds of cities? In what kinds of formats, et cetera, et cetera? Then what is the specific problem you were solving? Ideally, you would some way have quantify that problem or there's some data or customer insights that have led you to understand that problem, to know that it is a meaningful and big problem. Ideally a problem that people would pay money",

Ideally, you would some way have quantify that problem or there's some data or customer insights that have led you to understand that problem, to know that it is a meaningful and big problem. Ideally a problem that people would pay money if you could solve that problem for, because you can just look at the economics of that problem, and if instead they use your solution, this would be beneficial to them.\n\n(00:43:50):\nSo I work to have them first implement this PR/FAQ process is the first step. Then the next step really is to go from there to say, \"Okay, writing PR/FAQs is one thing. Well, how do I actually use them? How do we actually develop them?\" Because there's this iterative nature to writing PR/FAQs where it's sort of a concentric circle review. You start off small with one author and with low fidelity writing these things, and then you start to share them with a small group and get feedback and improve it, a wider group, get feedback and improve it, and onward and onward until, depending on the size and scale of your company, you get up to the CEO as a way to strengthen, improve and really codify this idea and determine whether it's a great idea or not. So I help them understand how does that work? How do you do this iterative process? Then once you've done that, then what do I do with these PR/FAQs once I've got them? How do I then think about that with respect to my roadmap?\n\nLenny (00:44:55):\nAwesome. Okay. That was an awesome overview. I'm going to fire off a couple of questions around the first part. Do you still suggest people do it as a press release? It feels like press releases aren't a thing anymore. Do you ever suggest people do it as a tweet or as TikTok video or a blog post?\n\nBill Carr (00:45:09):\nGood question. So the first thing is it's not a real press release, okay? We could change the nature of it, and if instead we wanted to call it the customer problem solution statement, right? We could just change it to that because there really are three money paragraphs in this. First of all. Yeah, it's not meant to be a real press release, so don't use the language you would use if you were sending an actual press release. This is like an internal document. Okay. So that's the first thing.\n\n(00:45:42):\nThe second thing is the heart of it really is that first paragraph, it's a short description, that second paragraph, that's the problem statement, and that third paragraph, that's solution statement. If you wanted to ditch the rest of it and the artifacts of the press release, you could. I think there are other benefits to it, like the headline, is this headline long and drawn out and I can't even tell what the heck this thing is from reading this headline? If you used a tweet that wouldn't work very well. \n\n(00:46:11):\nThe date is also a meaningful thing when you write the press release. The date is meant to be a hypothetical timing on which you're envisioning launching this thing which tells the reader something. Are you thinking that this is something that's so simple and easy, we're going to launch it next month or so complex that we're going to launch it in a year from now. So there are some other directional cues within it. Like I said, with everything, these are tools that people can use and I'm sure that companies will find other ways to improve upon these tools, but if you don't use those parts of them correctly, you're kind of missing out on what's the main benefit that your getting out of this.\n\nLenny (00:46:50):\nDo you try to write it in a way that would be announced, like a press release feel? Or is it mostly just who is the customer? Do you try to pitch it as a part of this experience?\n\nBill Carr (00:47:01):\nSo you try to write it in that way, but the one thing is you don't want to use hyperbole. It would be very factual with numbers, data rich document too. So again, not like a real press release. A lot of internal confidential data would be in this press release.\n\nLenny (00:47:25):\nGot it.\n\nBill Carr (00:47:25):\nSo it's a tool that has a very specific use to it.\n\nLenny (00:47:34):\nIs there a template that we can point people to in the show notes to help them craft this? I think there's a version in your book maybe, but is there some online that we could point people to?\n\nBill Carr (00:47:43):\nYeah, so we have a website related to the book, which is www.workingbackwards.com, and there's a resources section within there and you'll find a template.\n\nLenny (00:47:53):\nAmazing. Okay. Then the concentric circle piece. So the idea there is basically get feedback from an increasingly larger swath of the company and it sounds like a big part of that is also get buy-in as you go- \n\nLenny (00:48:00):\n... swath of the company. And it sounds like a big part of that is also get buy-in as you go along the way.\n\nBill Carr (00:48:05):\nYes and no. So first of all, there are some things where you may write it and you, the author, if we were in the old world, would take the piece of paper, crumple",

And it sounds like a big part of that is also get buy-in as you go along the way.\n\nBill Carr (00:48:05):\nYes and no. So first of all, there are some things where you may write it and you, the author, if we were in the old world, would take the piece of paper, crumple up and throw in the trash can, which is, in your own, you've realized, \"Now that I put this down on paper and read it, this is not actually that good of an idea. I'm going to try something else.\" By the same token, you may then have written one you think is a pretty good idea, and you show up here or your manager and they give you feedback that makes you want to then ball it up and throw it into the trash can.\n\n(00:48:38):\nSo part of this concentric circle thing is not just that everyone you write lives on and gets all the way to the CEO. There are no stats in this, but let's just say in some imaginary world where, yes, all these things... You're a product manager and you've got a director of product management you report to who reports to some senior vice president of division who reports to a CEO. Well, if you truly run this out and you write 100 PRFAQs in a year, maybe 20 of those make it their way to the CEO. The point is not every single one of them is destined to go that far. The numbers get narrower. And this leads me down to the concept of what you're really trying to create is a product funnel, not a product tunnel. And with a funnel, meaning lots of things at the top, fewer things at the bottom. The tunnel means that everything that comes in is also going to come out the other side.\n\n(00:49:40):\nAnd the problem with that method is that it means you're not actually having a method of consideration and comparing it against other things that you might build or how you deploy what are, frankly, most companies, your most precious resources, which is your engineering team, you should be looking at various choices. You should think of yourself honestly as a venture capitalist. They don't fund every company that they meet with. They actually fund a very, very low percentage of them. And at Amazon, we had lots and lots of PRFAQs that were a great idea, but we didn't ship them because we had other ones that were just a better idea, which had a bigger potential impact. So you want that. You want to create this corpus of ideas that are well-thought-out and select the best ones.\n\nLenny (00:50:27):\nIt feels like a lot of these processes are basically just ways to stop stupid shit from happening. I think the narrative is a good example where you have to expose your thinking deeply. This is a great example of that.\n\nBill Carr (00:50:39):\nYeah. And it's also, I would say, an example of where this is a process to prevent the other process, which is the product development process, from becoming the thing where you just get locked in on, \"What are we doing in this sprint, what are we trying to get done,\" and focused on shipping stuff. What I recommend is you try to break that into two different processes. One is the process of deciding what you should go build, and that's what the PRFAQ is designed for. And then once you've decided that, then, yes, by all means, use all that good thinking, freight, \"Now how can I ship it efficiently and effectively with few to no bugs?\"\n\nLenny (00:51:19):\nI was just reading this Harvard Business Review article, I think that's called the thinking to doing gap, where a lot of companies just spend a lot of time talking about ideas and solutions and not actually doing anything. And so I'm curious how you try to avoid that at Amazon considering there's this period of just like, \"Let's explore, explore, explore, and we're fine.\"\n\nBill Carr (00:51:39):\nThere's a couple ways, and of course I'm somewhat having to imagine what are the problems in such companies where that's going on. So one such version of this problem is what I'd call the-big-idea-that's-not-fleshed-out problem. So I'm sure that every single person listening to this podcast has either themselves done this or have witnessed others in their company who come up with a concept of like, \"Oh, I think if we built this, boy, that would really solve things or that would really work well or that would really grow things.\" And it may sound good to everyone, it may sound good to you, to everyone, and then maybe you start then working on building it. But the reality is that actually once you've spent some time looking at that idea more deeply, you then start to identify several roadblocks or maybe a fatal flaw with this idea. And in fact, no, you shouldn't waste any of your time going into building that thing because it has a fatal flaw.\n\n(00:52:46):\nSo one problem is that companies get stuck, I think, where they never actually go do that documentation. And so it's a debate and discussion about concepts that aren't really well fleshed out. And so people's ability to actually evaluate them in any realistic way is they don't have a good way. And so in those situations, what gets done is probably more of a function of politics or will or a culture of completely top-down. I think the other way is where they're debating and discussing things that they just don't have good methods where then they can take things, and then go build them, meaning they probably don't have the right org structure or processes in place to then go take",

And after they have owned it and gone and look at it, if it works, then they and their team can go actually build it.\n\n(00:53:50):\nWhat I always found as I became more senior in the company and my role became bigger and bigger is that when something came up, some idea that didn't neatly fit within my org structure, I couldn't necessarily delegate it to someone that this... There were only two things I could possibly do, which is just set it aside altogether because otherwise it'd just be a real distraction to people or I had to decide this was a compelling enough idea that we were going to take a resource, could be one person, could be a whole team, depending on the idea, and I'm going to have to assign that resource to actually go look at this and work at this. Otherwise, it will never happen.\n\nLenny (00:54:31):\nI've been through those many times. Okay. So there's two more concepts I want to try to touch on before we wrap up. The next one is the idea of input and output metrics. This is something that at Airbnb, we super implemented, it became a very defective way of thinking. And actually there's a lot of Amazonians that ended up at Airbnb, a lot of leadership. So there's a lot of this stuff that we ended up doing like the memos. And so on the input and output metrics, could you just describe what that is and why that's so important, why people think about metrics in the wrong way often?\n\nBill Carr (00:55:03):\nYeah, so the origin of this one really was, again, in our early years at Amazon, '99, 2000, 2001, we were a public company then, we were growing. But then growth started to... It wasn't just all up into the right and like, \"Woo-hoo.\" Every company's going to hit a wall eventually, and it's not going to be... If you're so lucky to even been at a company where it's just going up into the right with no gravity, good for you, because million people never experienced that.\n\n(00:55:36):\nWhat most people experience is the reality is that there's a lot of gravity pulling against your revenue numbers and you've put a plan out there and you wanted to grow 15% or 20% or 75% or whatever it was, and now you look like you're not going to hit that number this quarter. And so what ensues then is, \"We're not going to hit our number. What should we do about that to hit our number?\" And this often happens with, well, there's a month or a month and a half left in the quarter, and then we would run around like chickens with our heads cut off and come up with a bunch of ideas that tended to be promotional in nature and tended to be price reduction in nature, or we'll send this extra email or extra ad or whatever it might be-\n\nLenny (00:56:19):\nAnother Prime Day.\n\nBill Carr (00:56:19):\nRight. And the reality is we did that, we went through that enough times, several quarters, and we started to realize, \"Huh, these fire drills don't really work.\" We didn't really get meaningful progress against the number with these last-minute things we decided to go do. And oh, by the way, they were a big distraction. If they did work at all, they pulled revenue that might've just gotten in the next month or next quarter into this one. So it wasn't really a zero-sum game there. And we realized we're not really actually working on things that matter to customers that are going to move the needle over the long term.\n\n(00:56:58):\nAnd this is about the same time when Jeff and the S-Team were reading the book, Good to Great. And you have to ask Jeff what it is, but if you ask me, I think that this was the single most influential and effective management book for our company because what it caused Jeff to do, and I won't describe what... Most of you probably know what it is, if you don't know what it is, go read Good to Great. It is, in my opinion, the best, most important management book you'll ever read. Because what it did is to help us codify our growth flywheel, meaning what are the inputs that if we improve these things, which in our case, was how do we have broad selection? How do we have a great customer experience or great customers experiences in retail? Things like how easy was it to find what you wanted to buy, how easy was it to buy it, and how fast did it get to you. Were the prices low? Do we have lots of merchants on our platform? And by the way, could we drive out costs?\n\n(00:58:06):\nSo we identified these things on our flywheel. And this identification of these things was such a critical moment for the company because then it realized, \"Okay. Well, what we need to do is spend our time focusing on how do I measure each one of those things, and then how do I improve each one of those things?\" So it shifted our focus away from this short-term thinking of pushing the revenue number up to this longer-term thinking that if",

There's no day that people will wake up 10 years, 20 years, 30 years from now and say, \"All else equal, I'd rather shop at a store with fewer items than more items or a store with higher prices than low prices or a store where things get to me more slowly versus more quickly.\" So if we can just improve these things, this is our path to winning. So those were all inputs to the customer experience. And so we then figured out ways to measure them creating a set of input metrics.\n\n(00:59:03):\nAnd so then when we would develop our operating plans and review our business each week and set our goals, we were hyperfocused on those inputs and the input metrics. As a simple example, there was one tool that Jeff and the leadership team, the S-Team, used called S-Team goals, which are effectively a list of what they would harvest would be like, \"Here are the most important goals for the company that I've harvested from all of our operating plans.\" And I can't remember exactly what year, something around 2007, 2008, they looked at that list, which is about 500 items long by the way, and they counted it up. And of that list, only 10 of them actually had a financial metric in it, like revenue or free cash flow or gross profit. These other things we're generally speaking, all... One of those inputs, like I mentioned to you about low prices, and selection, and speed of the customer experience.\n\n(01:00:03):\nSo, yes, the point was, again, it's this other article... So we took it as an article of faith that if we can just improve these inputs, the outputs will take care of themselves. The inputs are the things that drive the outputs, which are revenue, customer activity, free cashflow. And so one of Amazon's... It's not really a secret, but one of Amazon's great strengths is [inaudible 01:00:28] focus on those things and make just continuous process, continuous improvement on each one of them and measure them rigorously.\n\nLenny (01:00:37):\nThe flywheel, you reminded me. It feels like that's another concept Amazon proliferated through all of companies is everyone's trying to create their own little flywheel, and I imagine everyone has that image of the Amazon flywheel in their head with a little orange circle in the center and the black arrows. On the topic of input metrics, just briefly, what is an example of a good input metric? Because I imagine people that are listening are like, \"Oh, shit. I got to think about my metrics as input and output now.\" What's a sign that's a good input metric?\n\nBill Carr (01:01:02):\nA sign that's a good input metric is, first of all, map your end-to-end customer experience. I never worked at Airbnb, but, okay, step one is that they clicked on some ad somewhere and showed up in the website or the app. Now you're in the app. Now you're looking at this first screen. Well, the first thing, what they're doing is they're browsing and/or they're searching. Okay. How are we measuring the speed, quality, and ease of that browsing and searching? Now they've got onto a detail page for an individual property. How are we measuring the speed, ease, and quality of the different actions they may take like reserve... Forgive me if I get any of my terminology wrong. I'm not an Airbnb-\n\nLenny (01:01:47):\nYou are, but it doesn't matter. It's close enough.\n\nBill Carr (01:01:51):\nSo then you've reserved. Now you have interactions with a property owner. How do I measure the quality of those? How many messages go back and forth? Is a lot of messages a good thing? Is that a bad thing? At first, you may not know the answer to that question. Same thing every step of the way. Then there's the actual rental experience. How do I instrument and measure every part of the customer experience? So you know it's an input metric if it is measuring something with respect to the customer experience. Which ones are the right metrics, which ones are the most causal to the outputs, I couldn't begin to tell you this is actually what you're getting paid for. You work at Airbnb to figure that out. And basically through an iterative process of measuring, observing, improving, and looking at what the effect is on your outputs.\n\n(01:02:49):\nSo, again, we didn't really create this concept. This is a concept from Six Sigma, which is using DMAIC, which is I have a process, there's an output of this process, but the inputs are a black box to me. So how do I understand those inputs? Well, DMAIC stands for define... Oh, boy. Define, measure... The A is going to come back to me in a minute. Improve and control. And I'm going to have to... Oh, gosh. The A is lost. I've lost it for a second here. But-\n\nLenny (01:03:26):\nOh, here it is. I'm looking at... Define, measure, analyze, improve-\n\nBill Carr (01:03:30):\nAnd analyze. Thank you. Yeah, duh, analyze.",

So we just use that process, which was... And by the way, the way we think about it first is like, \"Well, you need to throw a lot of things at the wall. You don't really know which of these things are going to be the most causal.\" So you know you're doing input metrics. If it is, do you control it? Meaning can you apply resources to make this thing better or worse? Does it touch customers? It doesn't always have to touch customers, but if it is affecting the customer experience, it's almost certainly is an input. And then which ways you're going to measure that input? You need to try more than one way, because again, we tell a story in the book about one of our most important input metrics, which was how much selection do we have, and we were actually not measuring that right for several years. We had to refine that measurement.\n\nLenny (01:04:23):\nSo I don't know if you saw this, but I asked on Twitter what questions I should ask you and tell people you were coming on. And something that came up a bunch is with working backwards, obviously some products Amazon has launched have not worked out. Say the Fire Phone is a classic example. What have you learned from that process of just like, \"Okay. [inaudible 01:04:42] won't work out\"? Also knowing many things are not going to work out, there's no way to really [inaudible 01:04:46].\n\nBill Carr (01:04:47):\nYes. So the one important thing to share is that all these tools that are described in this book that Amazon is using, whether it's using documents and meetings or the PRFAQ process or input metrics, is that none of these things give you the answer. They are tools to help you make decisions. So sometimes you're going to make the wrong decision. Fire Phone is a great example that comes up often, people ask, \"Well, if you've got this great PRFAQ process, how did you get Fire Phone?\" So I was tangential to the Fire Phone team and I worked on it closely and different people have different opinions, so I'll just share my opinion, which is that if you think about, again, how does the PRFAQ process work? Well, there's a customer problem.\n\n(01:05:36):\nWell, what was the problem that the Fire Phone was seeking to solve for customers? I would argue this is a case where we made the mistake of what we had a technology solution in mind, which was 3D effects. And then we took that solution and we're then in search of a problem. I don't think it solved any meaningful problems for customers. And candidly, we had to build a version with the music application and the Prime Video application for this phone. And I couldn't figure out how this 3D part would make it better for the customers to discover, watch, or playback any of these media. Maybe there were games that could have been a great solution, I don't know. But I think the simplest place to go when you see a failed product is to ask yourself, what problem did you solve? And I could get into all kinds of other examples outside of Amazon too, but 9 times out of 10, I think that's where... If it wasn't poor execution, if the product was executed correctly, what was wrong with the concept of the product?\n\nLenny (01:06:48):\nI imagine there was a lot of disagreeing and committing on that concentric circle process. Is there anything that you've found of just the number of disagreement and commits in this process of PRFAQ filtering out, I don't know, that tells you maybe this is not a good idea?\n\nBill Carr (01:07:03):\nNot necessarily. So I'll tell you partly also why the Fire Phone happened was, from my point of view, I think that we had had a number of successful products where, in some cases, there were a lot of people who doubted whether it would work. A lot of people inside Amazon doubted that the Kindle was going to be a good idea. I remember contentious board meetings on this topic. So even within a company that was considered innovative, you would have a lot of people that would doubt things. I can tell you that for years is working on Prime Video, I would tell people about what our envision was of you watching on your TV set and we're going to have our own motion studio. We'll make our own movies and TV shows. And they would laugh at me. They thought that was crazy. So that's not necessarily the sign of whether the product is right or wrong. And so that's a problem actually, that makes it harder to know.\n\nLenny (01:08:02):\nYeah. And I think something Amazon's incredibly good at is being okay with a lot of failures, and I think that's part of the reason there's been so much innovation. Is that true?\n\nBill Carr (01:08:11):\nI'd say it's partially true. I mean, again, it's hard for me to do a compare and contrast with other companies. But I can tell you did we have a lot of things that we launched that failed? Yes. Some of them are very public and obvious. I'll give you one that people don't really realize. It's something called... We had a feature in the early 2000",

Some of them are very public and obvious. I'll give you one that people don't really realize. It's something called... We had a feature in the early 2000s called Slots. And what it was was it was basically third parties could bid on different search terms and put a little ad in there.\n\nLenny (01:08:11):\nSounds familiar.\n\nBill Carr (01:08:42):\nWell, obviously, that works now on Amazon, but it didn't work then because we simply didn't have the scale that Amazon has today. So a lot of times a product idea, a perfectly good idea, you just have the wrong time or the technology isn't there. I mean, Jeff wrote about a product that was a puck that sat in your kitchen that you would talk to and ask it for things and could shop from it. He wrote about that in 2004. Well, the technology wasn't there to be able to create that little puck, which one day would become Echo. It was a decade away. But we had a lot of things we launched that failed. We were not afraid to take what we considered a well-calculated risk. I think many, many companies are less willing to do so, less committed to product innovation, and really do not want that fear of... They do fear failure, and they're really focused on their near-term financial goals. It's not their fault. It's the way a public company and Wall Street interact with each other creates this dynamic.\n\nLenny (01:09:55):\nJust to pull on that thread a little bit more. It feels like a lot of companies talk about, \"We're okay failing. We're okay launching things that don't work,\" but then in practice, their performance review is impacted. Teams get shut down, budgets get pulled. Is there something that you recommend to companies that want to actually improve in this? What could they actually change and actually do this well?\n\nBill Carr (01:10:16):\nYeah, I just spoke with actually a senior executive at a well-known Silicon Valley company about this topic the other day and said, \"Well, what is it we had structurally at Amazon, especially from a people point of view, that would enable or encourage people to take these risks?\" Because, yes, in a lot of companies, if you go work on the project that fails, then your career is in the garbage can and/or your compensation system, you're going to lose out on that bonus. So there were two things. One was our compensation system. So there were no performance bonuses. So if I was running the book business and I had a killer year from a financial point of view, there was no extra kicker for me. And if I ran the book business and it had a bad year, there was no financial penalty for me either because our compensation was based on the stock price.\n\n(01:11:12):\nSo we all had an incentive to do what was right for the company, frankly, over a long-term because trying to win off of short-term fluctuations off Wall Street is a losing proposition, which meant that therefore, if I am... Because I had that situation, I moved off of working on our largest P&L, and then the book business and music and video business, now I'm going to go work on digital media. There is zero business there. This might not work. Well, my compensation didn't change as a result of that. It didn't change one way or the other. We tended to also have a performance management system that then would change compensation based on evaluating what did you actually deliver more in an input method. We cared about the outputs too, but just there are plenty of people that could be-\n\nBill Carr (01:12:00):\nJust, there are plenty of people that could be in a business that's up and to the right but has nothing to do with them. And so we tried to focus more on, well, what did you actually build and contribute, ways you improved selection or lowered prices, or whatever that might be. So those two things about the compensation mattered a lot. And then the second thing was having a CEO who was really committed to it and it wasn't something that they delegated to someone else.\n\n(01:12:31):\nSo Safi Bahcall, I think, writes about this in his book Loonshots, where part of the conditions that are necessary for innovation to occur are that you actually create different structures of decision-making, of approvals, of all kinds of things, if you create some team that's going to go build something new and innovative. Because most of the structures inside a big company are designed to crush and impede a small innovative team that's trying to go build something new. They need speed, but approval here, approval there, it's going to get in their way.\n\n(01:13:10):\nWe solved that two ways, one was when we went to go build digital media and AWS, we put two of our smartest leaders in the company on those things, Steve Kessel and Andy Jassy. And number two, they were meeting with Jeff regularly. Jeff was deeply engaged with them, reviewing what are we going to go build? Part of the decision to decide where we're going to go build. And so he could then also, between their seniority and of course him being the CEO, they could run interference on these sorts of things too. So even if you want to have innovation, even if you really do crave it, you're willing to take the risk, if you don't set up the organization in the right way, you're just not going to",

I'm glad we got into that, I wasn't planning to talk about that and I'm glad we did. Final topic, this concept of Bar Raisers, it feels like it's been such a core way of allowing Amazon to scale successfully, and I think that's something a lot of people can implement, it's a very one-off thing you could just implement at your company. Can you just talk about what this idea of a Bar Raiser is in the hiring process and then what people can do if they wanted to add this to their hiring process?\n\nBill Carr (01:14:19):\nSo the Bar Raiser hiring process is a process, it was actually one of the first ones that was established and published, pretty early in the company's history back in 1999. And we created it for a simple reason, to quote one senior leader at Amazon, \"We had new people hiring new people hiring new people.\" We were in our hyper-growth phase, okay? The company was only, what, three, four years old, and we were growing like a weed at that point.\n\n(01:14:47):\nSo this started off actually in our tech org, and what our senior leaders in tech realized is, my gosh, we hire some new engineering leader, and then the next thing is that their job is to go hire the senior managers, and they'll go hire managers. And all these people have been here for a week, so they don't really even know our company yet, they don't know our culture yet, they don't know our standards yet. So what information are they using to make these hires, and what information they were using is obviously they were just using their own personal judgment, and their personal judgment combined with whatever criteria they used at prior companies that they worked for. So let's say if they came over from Microsoft, if Microsoft had some methodology or criteria, they probably would just apply that.\n\n(01:15:38):\nWell, is that methodology or criteria relevant to our company? Because every company has a different culture, and I'm here to tell you that if someone's been a super successful vice president at Microsoft, does not mean they could be as super successful at Amazon or at Google or Facebook. Sometimes they can, but these companies are very different, they all do work very differently. The way leadership happens and decisions are made are very different. So how do we fix this problem other than letting it run rampant and basically hire a bunch of people who are, we don't know if they fit our culture and we don't know if they fit our high standards we have for what we expect of engineering leaders or engineers?\n\n(01:16:21):\nSo they created this Bar Raiser process, which by the way, they borrowed from Microsoft, which had a process called As Appropriate. And the concept was that on every interview loop there's one person, who is not the hiring manager, who doesn't report to the hiring manager, who's not the recruiting manager, they're in the business, they're a software development manager, or they're a marketing manager, and they are on the interview loop and they're a Bar Raiser, which means when we get to the debrief meeting, they will run that meeting, not the hiring manager, not the recruiter, they will run the meeting. And it also means that they technically have veto power over the hiring manager, which, by the way, a good Bar Raiser never uses, or I never saw a Bar Raiser use. I was a Bar Raiser, and in my 15 years at Amazon I never used it, never saw it used.\n\n(01:17:14):\nAnd then finally, which actually was not true in 1999 but later became true, was once we established our leadership principles, we created a set of objective criteria that would be used and an interview methodology that would be used in every interview, which was the objective criteria would be our leadership principles, and the methodology would be behavioral based interviewing.\n\n(01:17:33):\nSo this Bar Raiser basically would be a subject matter expert on how this process worked, they'd conduct the debrief to make sure that we were actually adhering to the process, that people were sticking to the objective criteria rather than saying, \"I don't think we should hire this person because, I don't know, they don't seem to want to work here enough.\" Maybe that's a valid reason, but it's actually not part of our objective criteria. And so the Bar Raiser was there to act as a balance also on the urgency bias that every hiring manager has, which is like, I got to fill these roles, but rather than filling them with the next warm body they find, make sure they fill them with people who actually meet our standards, fit our culture and meet our standards for functional excellence too.\n\nLenny (01:18:21):\nSuch a cool process. Two questions along these lines, one is who has the final decision in hiring, is it the hiring manager?\n\nBill Carr (01:18:27):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:18:28):\nAnd this is just off advice from the Bar Raiser?\n\nBill Carr (01:18:31):\nYeah, so this often gets confused. The decision maker is the hiring manager, the whole interview loop and the Bar Raiser are actually just there to help the hiring manager make the right decision. Now oftentimes the",

The decision maker is the hiring manager, the whole interview loop and the Bar Raiser are actually just there to help the hiring manager make the right decision. Now oftentimes the hiring manager could feel like this is actually a bureaucratic process and a group of people that I have to sell and they're just in my way between me and hiring this person, which is kind of a natural feeling to have.\n\n(01:18:54):\nBut one of the feedback I would always give managers who are new to this is like, no, no, no, that's not the way to think about it, think about these people are helping you, because the amount of time you're going to put into the hiring process may seem like a lot, but if you hire the wrong person, boy, that amount of time you're going to have to deal with managing that person, that's going to be a lot more, the impact on the team, impact on you. So making a great decision here is important, they're here to help you.\n\n(01:19:20):\nSo yes, the final decision is with the hiring manager, technically speaking the Bar Raiser could block them from a decision to hire someone, but they would, well done they would help the hiring manager see the reasons not to hire the person through a Socratic method and how they would guide the discussion.\n\nLenny (01:19:40):\nAnd then when you're choosing a Bar Raiser, is there any suggestions you have of who to choose and how often you pull them into these things? Because it could also be a huge time suck.\n\nBill Carr (01:19:49):\nIt is a huge time suck, and it sometimes could be up to 10 hours of my week spent actually as a Bar Raiser. The selection process is you start with, as a company, I would recommend if you wanted to do this, you'd pick a department to pilot it with. Pick people who are A, care a lot about your hiring process, B, appear to be good interviewers, and C, seem to have high standards. It's also a great role for people who are earlier in their career by giving them this additional leadership opportunity. It's a great way to grow and develop leaders, by the way, because this added responsibility is a great way for them to start testing out leadership. And you have to train them properly and you have to have dedication to the process, but I generally would try to pilot it within one group at first.\n\nLenny (01:20:41):\nOne last question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Many people are listening to this, they're considering implementing some of these things, trying to figure out how to actually make these real. If someone were trying to move along the path of becoming more Amazonian, which of these elements and processes do you think often has the most impact? And/or is there something fundamental that needs to change to allow for some change like this to happen at a company, in your experience?\n\nBill Carr (01:21:10):\nYeah, good question. And the first thing I'd say is one thing to be careful of is a lot of times when I'm talking to a company about these processes they say, well, does this mean we need to turn into Amazon? And first thing I tell them is, well, first of all, I couldn't turn you into Amazon if I wanted to, because you have your own culture. And secondly, no, that's not the idea is for you to try to become Amazon, the purpose is to sort of look at these processes and best practices they have and consider adopting parts or all of them into your organization to improve these, every company of a certain scale has these same processes, so this is just a different way to do them. So you should have scalable, repeatable processes for each one of these, pick one, here's one choice of ways to do these things.\n\n(01:21:58):\nThe other piece of advice I give is that a lot of these changes are relatively profound, they really require buy-in all the way up to the CEO, if you're really going to change the way you do product development, or if you're really going to change the way you do hiring, that probably requires buy-in of the CEO, and so I would seek to get that probably before I would move too fast. Some of these things, though, can be piloted in your own little group, like your one little product development group. You want to decide you want to start writing PR FAQs, you probably can decide to do that. But again, try to check with your leadership.\n\n(01:22:32):\nThe other thing I would just tell you is that for any of these processes, these in our book, or any book, implementing a new process is not easy. And if you go into it lightly and dip your toes into it and try it out, it's probably not going to work for you, because it'll be hard at first, and it requires some level of commitment to actually work through that hard part and say, I'm really committed to doing this, and it will take a few months for you to get good at it. So you have to have commitment and discipline to get through it. Anyone can really do these things, it just requires commitment and discipline.\n\nLenny (01:23:10):\nAnd in our chat we've basically just scratched the surface of a lot of these things, if people want to dig deeper there's obviously your book Working Backwards, which we'll link to in the show notes.

Yeah, Colin, and I, one of the reasons we wrote this book was to pass on what we learned to the next generation of business leaders at scale with a book, but also because we had a passion to work with companies directly one-to-one. And so we are advisors, consultants, call it what you will, but non-traditional, we don't have a team of people working for us. Each of us just work directly with the companies who engage us.\n\n(01:23:55):\nAnd generally speaking what we do is the right kind of company for us to work with, first of all, has to achieve a certain scale. Companies that are in the product market fit phase, they need to focus on getting product market fit, they probably don't really need to focus much on how they put in scalable, durable processes. Like sure, some of these could definitely be helpful to you even if you're in that phase, but really these are designed for, my company's become complex now, I've got multiple product lines, it's well over 100 million in annual run rate, growing fast, complex. So most of our clients are either large, well past series C private companies, or they're public companies. And in most cases, a C-level leader, or the CEO themselves, has read our book and recognizes that they have a lot of the same problems that we had at Amazon, and looks at these as useful solutions and wants us to help them implement them.\n\n(01:24:56):\nSo we tend to usually first actually go in and do an assessment of how they do things today, because to help people move from one place to another we have to understand where they are, and then we come up with a prioritized list along with that, the CEO and C-level leaders, of what are the things that would be most useful, what are the symptoms and problems you're having and what are the root cause solutions that could be found in these processes? And then we sort of prioritize those and come up with a plan to work within the organization to help them implement those. And what's also different is that we're very hands- on working at all levels of the company, and as we do it we will be there in the meetings with the teams to help coach them and teach them along so that we make sure that it actually gets implemented properly and to spec, and they get to the outcome they want.\n\nLenny (01:25:45):\nSounds amazing. How would people engage with you if they wanted to explore this?\n\nBill Carr (01:25:51):\nSimple way is you can just send an email, I'm bill@workingbackwards.com, and Colin is colin@workingbackwards.com. You can also just check out our website, www. workingbackwards.com. We have some information there, we have a contact us form, those would be the best ways.\n\nLenny (01:26:05):\nOkay. Well with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you, are you ready?\n\nBill Carr (01:26:11):\nI'll try.\n\nLenny (01:26:12):\nInterestingly, as I look through the list, many of them relate to using Amazon, which is pretty funny. The first is, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nBill Carr (01:26:23):\nSo I'd say in the management world, not surprisingly, Good to Great. I'd say Drucker on Management, or Drucker, The Effective Executive. And then the other one I'd say that's a little bit different is I'd recommend the Steve Jobs biography. I never worked at Apple, but looking at that arc, a lot of the way those things worked was not that different from what I experienced at Amazon, so it's a good window into what it's like to be inside some company, tech company, that goes through product innovation and big growth. On a personal basis, recent books would be Seveneves by Neal Stephenson is a favorite, and A Gentleman in Moscow.\n\nLenny (01:27:05):\nAmazing. Can you get them all on Amazon?\n\nBill Carr (01:27:07):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:27:07):\nAnother Amazon related question potentially is do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show? Might be on Prime, might not be.\n\nBill Carr (01:27:15):\nYeah, my favorite recent movie is the latest Dune movie, and I can't wait for the new one to come out.\n\nLenny (01:27:20):\nWhen is that coming out? It seems like I've been waiting a long time.\n\nBill Carr (01:27:22):\nI think it's supposed to come out next month. I used to know this, I used to have to know the answer to this question, but I don't anymore. But I anxiously await the next one, I thought that last one was awesome. I even liked the original Dune movie, so I'm probably unusual that way. And I just watched, along with my wife, we just enjoyed watching the TV series A Spy Among Friends, which was on MGM+.\n\nLenny (01:27:50",

What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like, maybe that you bought on Amazon, maybe not.\n\nBill Carr (01:28:08):\nThis one I did not buy on Amazon, and this one is, most of you may not understand this one, but I'm an avid cyclist and I got myself a new set of wheels for my road bike this year, actually my road bike and my gravel bike. It's the Zipp 303 Firecrest, the latest model, and boy, these are just fantastic wheels. They're light, they're sturdy, they absorb all the bumps well, I can use them on a road bike, I can use them on a gravel bike, awesome wheels.\n\nLenny (01:28:35):\nWow, that might be the most obscure random product that we've had yet. Recently we had a humidifier, so I like this collection of products we're building here. Create a wishlist on Amazon maybe.\n\nBill Carr (01:28:47):\nNice.\n\nLenny (01:28:47):\nDo you have a favorite interview question that you really like to ask?\n\nBill Carr (01:28:52):\nYeah, it's actually quite basic, it's tell me about your most significant professional accomplishment. And I have to always clarify this, by this I mean not some award you won or some promotion you got, I mean something you built, or some product, some process, some organization you built, something like that. And I could basically then, once they get into that example, ask a lot of probing and follow-up questions and I could fill an entire hour interview just sticking with this one example to really understand how they... Using the STAR method, which is to try to understand everything from the situation to the result, and everything they did in between, who they influenced, how they'd influenced, what decisions they had to make, what roadblocks they encountered. If I just pull on that one string I can learn a whole lot about a candidate.\n\nLenny (01:29:46):\nNext question, what's a favorite life motto that you often find yourself coming back to, sharing with friends, that you find useful?\n\nBill Carr (01:29:55):\nWell, one that I end up coming to a lot professionally, and somewhat personally, is this one called slow is smooth and smooth is fast. This is a, I believe the origins of this one are actually from the Marine Corps for the Scout Snipers, so not trying to promote that particular craft, but the point of it is that actually, and we did this a lot at Amazon, it really oftentimes, to really to go fast, you actually need to go slow first and to be very clear on what you're doing and where you want to go. Most people confuse speed with velocity, and the difference between the two is that velocity has both speed and a vector to it, meaning there's some specific destination. And so I see a lot of people who are going very, very fast, but the destination isn't very clear, they haven't really thought that out well. So slow is smooth, smooth is fast.\n\nLenny (01:30:57):\nThere's a similar quote that I've always thought of, of you've got to go slow to go fast. And I always thought it was was Stephen Covey, but I just Googled as you were chatting and it's someone named Peter Senge in the book Fifth Discipline.\n\nBill Carr (01:31:11):\nIt took me a while, I always wanted to go fast first and not go slow first, so I'd say a lot of my personal development and growth, it's a big thing that I learned from Jeff at Amazon.\n\nLenny (01:31:25):\nFinal question, I don't know if you'll have an answer to this, but is there a pro-tip that you could suggest for using Amazon? Something that people may not know about how to get the most out of using amazon.com?\n\nBill Carr (01:31:36):\nSorry, I have no secret insights. There's not something like if you go on Monday mornings at this time the prices are lower, or something, or in stock is better. No, I know of no such thing.\n\nLenny (01:31:49):\nWhich I think is great, because it's built exactly as it should be for customers.\n\nBill Carr (01:31:54):\nI guess so. But it used to be, maybe in the days of the slower internet, that I would tell you to go at non-peak hours, but this isn't really an issue anymore.\n\nLenny (01:32:06):\nThat'd be wild if that was still an issue. Bill, this was everything I hoped it would be, thank you so much for being here. You already shared where folks can find you online, so I'll skip that question. So final question is, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBill Carr (01:32:19):\nWe're always looking for feedback",

Um, being a CEO or founder makes it slightly harder, uh, in some ways, because you still have to put on this mask. You have to put on this space of confidence externally and- and internally as well, where people need to trust you. You also don't want to subject them to the same anxiety that you're feeling and be a 100% transparent. \n[00:00:28] Lenny: Ryan Hoover is the founder of Product Hunt, which you already know. He's also former product manager, which I did not know. Currently, he's a full-time investor with his fund, the Weekend Fund. He's also an author of a bunch of great block posts and an actual book, called Hooked. He's also really good on Twitter and in my opinion, a very special human being. Ryan Hoover, welcome to the podcast.\n[00:00:52] Ryan: Hey, Lenny. Thanks for having me. I've been reading a lot of your blog posts over, I don't know, past two or three years now, and I'm glad to- to see you do the podcast now. It's cool.\n[00:01:01] Lenny: Thank you, man. That compliment will go straight to my heart. And I will think about it often. I appreciate that. \n[00:01:07] Ryan: Cut- cut that and put it on Twitter. There you go. Yeah. [laughs]\n[00:01:09] Lenny: [That's the clip, we're done. [laughs]\n[00:01:10] Ryan: Yeah. Done, over. [laughs]\n[00:01:14] Lenny: [laughs] This episode's brought to you by RevenueCat.

And what happens when they do?\n[00:02:26] Ashley: Well, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So, if your CMC importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chock-full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.\n[00:02:43] Lenny: I am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both sign-up conversion and increasing longterm retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.\n[00:03:01] Ashley: Totally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify, and ZORA are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.\n[00:03:17] Lenny: If you'd like to learn more or get started, check out Flatfile at flatfile.com/lenny.\n[00:03:23] Lenny: You're such a tech celebrity; everybody knows Product Hunt. Everybody knows Ryan Hoover, at least in tech. And I'm curious, how often are you recognized walking around the street, in life, and has there ever been like a super awkward or super hilarious moment of that?\n[00:03:37] Ryan: Yeah, so t- Product Hunt started in late 2013 and quickly got a lot of traction in- in the tech- tech sphere. So, yeah, people in tech, um, might recognize me. People outside of tech, doubt- doubt they recognized me. Um, I actually do wonder subconsciously if I grew my hair out to avoid being recognized. \nUm, I'm not sure if it's true or not, but anyway, it's been a couple years or so growing my hair out and I'm like, ah, I just kinda wanna like disappear sometimes. But, you know, in San Francisco, where everybody's in tech, um, there was a lot of that. And probably the- the, the moment where I was like, \"Oh, this is- this is like a thing,\" uh, it was probably early Product Hunt, uh, I was at- do you remember... I don't know if you know this. Do you know a club, um, called DNA Lounge, and they did something-\n[00:04:19] Lenny: Mm-hmm.\n[00:04:20] Ryan: ... Called Bootie every Saturday-\n[00:04:20] Lenny: Mm-hmm.\n[00:04",

It was like a mash-up dance party.\n[00:04:22] Lenny: Yeah.\n[00:04:23] Ryan: Yeah. Super well known in the Bay Area. Really fun, fun, uh, kind of experience. Anyway, I remember being with friends and drinking, like- like one does and somebody turns around and says, “Is that the Product Hunt guy?” \n[00:04:33] Lenny: [laughs]\n[00:04:33] Ryan: And that was the first time that sort of happened in that setting where I was like, oh gosh, now I have to like, think about my actions. And I can't just like, be entirely like loose and, you know, relax with my friends. And, um, so anyway, there- there's always pros and cons to those types of things. Um, but you know, it- it definitely is makes me more aware of, I'm already a very, like sometimes anxious and like self-aware person in terms of like my surroundings.\nAnd so when you combine that with, “Oh, these strangers might be watching me,” is not the best thing in the world, but it's okay.\n[00:05:04] Lenny: I've actually gone a little bit through that same experience recently in my, like a much smaller sense where I- with this newsletter and the growth of this thing, there’s been like meetups happening all over the world. And so I've been going to the SF meetups here and there, and it feels very strange to be like, known and people get- they’re like taken pictures with me, like what the- what the hell's going on.\n‘Cause I started this thing as, uh, COVID hit and it was like- everyone's at home, I was just typing on my computer, didn’t have to go anywhere. And as the world has emerged, it's become a new- a new thing I'm dealing with, on a much smaller scale.\n[00:05:35] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. Events are events are fun. Um, we threw a bunch of them at- at Product Hunt. Uh, yeah, you- you do a lot of selfies and a lot of like, handshakes and it’s- there's, there's some energy there. I'm an introvert though. So by hour, like three or four, I'm just like, ugh… uh… I need to use the restroom cause I haven't been able to escape and I'm socially exhausted, so, but they are fun.\n[00:05:55] Lenny: I know, uh, exactly what you mean. I am also an introvert and I get so drained doing things like that. I was gonna ask you about that. So yeah. Um, along the same lines, you’re- you're a very public person. You tweet a lot, you share a lot, you do a lot of podcasts and things like that. What's something that people don't know about you?\n[00:06:12] Ryan: Yeah. Um, you're right. I- I probably sh- maybe overshare, uh, on Twitter and other things…\n[00:06:17] Lenny: No, that, that is not what-\n[00:06:18] Ryan: Um, there is a list of [laughs] no, no, I know. I know what you're saying. Um, but there's also a whole series of things that I don't talk about. Um, some of them- well, anyway, I won't, I won't talk about the things I can't talk about.\nUh, but one thing that, um, one thing that most people don't know about- I know there- there's certain juicy things, uh, like everybody has in their life. Um, I recently moved to- well, I guess it's been a year. Um, I moved to Miami about a year ago and, uh, I haven't been talking about it publicly, primarily because I just didn't want to be lumped into, oh, another person moving to Miami.\nLike, I, I don't know. I just, there's no benefit or like, reason for me to do so. Uh, I want my friends there in Miami to know I'm there, but otherwise I don't need the world to know. I guess now they will. Um, that said in Miami, you know, we’re- we're there about two thirds of the year, so I'm actually in California right now.\nUm, as you know, the summer humidity come- comes through Miami and hurricane season. We’re- we're planning to do more of, um- I wouldn't call it nomadic and I wouldn't call it bicoastal per se, but something like that. Where two thirds of the year we’re Miami and then maybe a third were in New York, or LA, or someplace else.\nUm, and I love that. Um, fortunately we have the flexibility, uh, when I say we, my girlfriend, Susie, and I, to just carry our laptops and work anywhere. So it's been- it's been a nice lifestyle kinda shift.\n[00:07:33] Lenny: I did not know that, that is very interesting. Why did you get pulled into Miami? What pulls you there?\n[00:07:39] Ryan: Yeah. You",

What pulls you there?\n[00:07:39] Ryan: Yeah. You know? Um, so the way I describe ci- cities are kinda like a product. So if you're in the supermarket or- supermarket, I sound like an, old- old person. Ha, if- if you're at a store, you're looking at different products, or if you're online, you're evaluating different products, and they each have like a cost and they have some benefits, um, or values or whatever you- you want to use to describe it.\nAnd for me, each city is kind of like that. And so, you know, in terms of costs, there's cost of living in terms of housing, uh, food, taxes, a bunch of things that go into the cost of living in the city. And then the city provides a lot of benefits and- and things like that. And so in LA- so I was in bay area for ten years, LA for two Miami for one.\nNow, they each have their own pros and cons. They each cost effectively different prices. And so we visited Miami a year and a half ago and we just fell in love with lot- lots of it. Um, we also- it's just cheaper. It's cheaper than the Bay Area. It's cheaper than LA. Um, when- when you kind of count, kinda like all in costs, um, and we had a bunch of friends move there, so we enjoyed the city.\nWe're like, this is good., strong ROI. Uh, this is a good product. Let’s- let's move there. Um, but at the same time, as I mentioned, like- we are traveling and, and exploring other cities. So it’s- it's kind of the best of both worlds for us.\n[00:08:53] Lenny: Very cool. Um, curious how long you last there and how you like it over time. I love Miami. I always have a good time when I go there. And I have many friends living there. Changing topics, a little bit, something that I've noticed you do recently, which is super cool is you offer people the chance to DM you questions that they have about their startup or their journey as a founder.\nAnd you just offer to give 'em free advice. And then sometimes you, tweet the DMs to share that with more folks. I'm curious just how many people have DM’d you because this is such a cool offer, and what have you learned going through this and kind of hearing people's questions?\n[00:09:26] Ryan: I first opened up my DMs- I had 'em closed, which is like traditionally the default on Twitter for a long time. ‘Cause I was like, “Oh, if I open them up, I'll just get a bunch of spam and I don't need another inbox to- to call through.” I opened it up quietly and, um, actually didn't get a lot of spam, uh, surprisingly. Like yeah, people would shill something or promote something, but it wasn't too bad.\nSo I- I left it open and then I forget, one day I was maybe I was like- on the elliptical, bike or the recumbent bike or something. And I was just… I- I tend to get on the bike and just hold my phone up and just do emails and work. And so, um, I just said, “Hey, DM me if you have any questions, any founders, and I'll try and like answer as many as I can.”\nAnd, um, part of my motivation for that was… I don't know, I was just killing time. And the other was, I used to blog a lot. I used to write a lot, um, I don't know, I've written hundreds of blog posts, but not so much anymore. I rarely write anymore. And part of it's because it just takes so long to write.\nAnd sometimes I don't feel like inspired by any topic. It’s- it's sort of like a writer's block. And so I found this also kind of as a means to like, do micro- almost like micro blog posts in a way, uh, where the prompt is the question from somebody else. I don't have to think about the pr- prompt. And then the answer is- is in some ways, a way for me to actually think about that- that topic, almost like refine my own thinking in, in some sense.\nAnd so I started doing that and then I realized, “Well, maybe other people have similar questions, and maybe other people have other answers and other ideas too,” so I would just take a screenshot of my answer and kind of summarize their answer, of course, keeping it anonymous, not sharing anything that would be sensitive. Um, and just put it on Twitter and- you know, it's been fun.\nI do that maybe once every three or four days, I share a new question and answer and, sort of like a… It's like micro blogging in a way, I guess that’s what Twitter is, but like it's a kind of like a real micro-blogging kind of like, uh, um, activity for me.\n[00:11:15] Lenny: Is there anything that's kind of surprised you, or that you've learned from founders? What they ask you about? Like, “Wow, I didn't expect this was gonna be such a common problem or question.”\n[00:11:24] Ryan: I wouldn't",

What they ask you about? Like, “Wow, I didn't expect this was gonna be such a common problem or question.”\n[00:11:24] Ryan: I wouldn't say anything like super surprising. However, a lot of people… So, you could do the same thing on Twitter and say, “Hey, AMA, ask me anything in public,” the thing is people are not gonna ask certain things, um, for a lot of reasons. And maybe the biggest surprise was a lot of people are pretty vulnerable.\nThese are strangers, founders who DM me saying, “Hey, I’m- we have three months runway left. We’re running out of money. Here's a situation. What advice do you have?” Or just things that, you know, everyone has to wear this unfortunate mask is kind of the way I- what I used to describe it. This mask in life, in business, where everything is going great.\nAnd you know, you're super confident, there are no problems. You got it all under control. And so the reality is that's not the case. Like [laughs] if you peered inside of almost every single company, it probably looks chaotic in- in different ways. And so I guess- I guess maybe the biggest surprise or thing that I value the most is the authenticity of people willing to share some of these, um, vulnerable moments and questions.\n[00:12:17] Lenny: Awesome. What's interesting about your format is as you were talking, I kind of realized it's very similar to my newsletter format, which I- which I think is part of the reason it worked is it's based on people asking me a question, and then I answer the question, and then-\n[00:12:28] Ryan: It's true. \n[00:12:29] Lenny: … And that ends up forcing you to have like concrete, actionable advice.\nSo you've kind of developed even more interesting way of doing it on Twitter, where it's more focused. So, very smart.\n[00:12:39] Ryan: I've always liked your format by the way, in that you are, um- you're a curator in many sense. Like- yeah, you have a lot of experience and good ideas, but you're not trying to answer all the questions in that you are really pulling in experts in their domain expertise to like find answers or inspiration.\nAnd I've always liked that format because one; it, I think leads to a better- better results, better content, better answers, but also it's arguably easier. Um, like imagine if- if you tried to like write, well, you you're shaking your head almost like it’s-\n[00:13:10] Lenny: Like if I had the answers, I'd be like, “Oh, here you go. I'm done.” You know, the research takes a lot of work and time, but- but I do agree. It ends up being a lot more useful and, and- and valuable. And the reason I did that, just to kind of explain that briefly, is when I left Airbnb, people kept coming to me and asking me like, “Hey, how did Airbnb do this thing?\nHow'd they do that thing.” And I was just like- like, they, they don't know what they're doing. They just did this thing, and who knows if that was the thing that helped them, or if that was the right way of approaching it. So I wanted to do this, like, “What does everyone do? And what seems to be the pattern of the things that work?” And that kind of led to this approach.\nAnd it takes a lot of time. Especially this new series that we're gonna chat a bit about that I worked on where it's just like endless interviews and chats and researchers and watching interviews. But yeah, it works out.\n[00:13:54] Ryan: Yeah, yeah. You- you, how many hours actually, do you put into like a typical essay?\n[00:13:59] Lenny: Oh, a reverse question. Uh, I would say the- \n[00:14:02] Ryan: Yeah, I don’t know if I'm supposed to ask you questions, [laughs] but I'm curious.\n[00:14:04] Lenny: This is banned. [laughs] No, it's cool. I say- I'd say the, uh, median post is about 10 hours. It's like, maybe I kind of work on it through the week. So maybe, like a few days through the week, but the most epic posts take hundreds and hundreds of hours that I kind of work on behind the scenes as I work on the weekly posts.\nSo there's a wide range. Some posts take like three hours and sometimes those do very well, much better than expected.\n[00:14:30] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah. I- that's exactly going back to my, my point about like- it takes a long time to write content that you're proud of. Um, I’m also just very particular about words, uh, for better or worse. And so I- the first draft actually is maybe like 20 or 30% of the time. And then the rest is refining it and getting feedback and everything else.\n[00:14:48] Lenny: That's exactly how I find it. The question I wanted to ask is, startups are so freaking hard… they almost always fail. It's always just like, “Oh my God, this is… Why am I doing this",

The question I wanted to ask is, startups are so freaking hard… they almost always fail. It's always just like, “Oh my God, this is… Why am I doing this to myself?? My general advice to founders is like, don't start a company, unless you just like, can't not start a company because it's so hard.\nWhat's your take there? What do you think? What do you advise founders for when they're thinking about, should I start a company? Should I not start a company? Which- how should I approach this?\n[00:15:15] Ryan: I do- I do spend time, ironically, like. challenging founders sometimes when they're thinking about raising or thinking about an idea to- to not raise. Um, people who are in tech, uh, especially, are certain bubbles [laughs] of tech, that’s the default. It's like, “The first thing I do, I have an idea, now let's go raise money.” \nAnd we've gone through some like pretty massive bull cycles where that- that was possible for a lot of people. But it's a huge decision. So with- with Product Hunt, it was a side project in the beginning. It wasn't actually intended to be a startup at all, but in the beginning, you know, it was a newsletter, then it was a website and it was about four to five months before we even incorporated.And we got a lot of traction. \nSo, it was during that time, I was really just thoughtful around, \"Should we raise? Do I wanna work on this for many, many years? What's the opportunity? Is this even a venture backable like idea?\" Like all those questions were circulating in my mind for a while. And this is also in a time when the market was pretty, was similarly bullish. This is, uh, end of 2013, early 2014. And investors were- were using Product Hunt to reach out to me, and they were sort courting- courting me, and um, kinda doing that whole song and dance to invest, but I- I just wasn't sure if I wanted to. And so, I don't know, I think a lot of the- those decisions, they're very personal and contextual. However, I think it's super important that founders see a line of sight to work on this for ... I think my rule of thumb is a decade, just do you see yourself working on this for a decade?\nAnd maybe it's not a decade that you actually work on it. It probably won’t, it either, it'll probably fail before then as most startups do, but I think it's a good litmus test for yourself to be like, “Do I actually care about this enough? Am I, am I really stoked to work on this for many, many years?” But then, you know, the other thing is, I think a lot of people also think “I need to start a company. I need to start a startup.” \nAnd they skip to that step without just tinkering and building and, you know, Product Hunt, we called it, not even a side project, we called it an experiment. And that framing I think, is for me, has always been helpful because it's an experiment is really not about success. Of course you want it to be successful, but the goal is not success.\nI put that in quotes, it's really to learn and, you know, see if people want this thing and then kind of adapt. And so like an experimental mindset is helpful and I think a valuable way to start. It even goes back to like, why I named the fund Weekend Fund. It's like, what are you tinkering with on the weekends?\nYou know? And how can you be more curious and experimental and kind of your exploration of new startup ideas?\n[00:17:43] Lenny: I didn't know that's why it was called the Weekend Fund. I thought it's because you worked on it on the weekends, or is it both?\n[00:17:48] Ryan: [laughs] It had like multiple meetings. Yeah, it was- three meanings: One was- was that I started Weekend Fund when I was building Product Hunt. So it took a lot of pitch- pitches and calls with founders on the weekends. Two, I think a lot of great ideas start by like metaphorically speaking, nights and weekends, um, kind of side projects or ideation.\nAnd then the third reason was it was like more friendly. I don't know, I didn't wanna name it. Hoover capital or something like sterile, wanted it to be -\n[00:18:14] Lenny: Wait, that's an awesome name. Hoover capital. Wow. \n[00:18:18] Ryan: …Capital. Uh I don't know. I, I feel well.\n[00:18:23] Lenny: Yeah, it's not on brand,\n[00:18:24] Ryan: Yeah. \n[00:18:25] Lenny: But it’s powerful- \n[00:18:25] Ryan: Um, yeah. [laughs] \n[00:18:28] Lenny: As you know, I asked people on Twitter what questions they would want to ask you. And so I'm gonna inter splice these questions as we go through this. And, you just touched on Product Hunt and fundraising, and I'm curious if you were to go back and- and do it again.\nWould you raise money for Product Hunt, or would you not?\n[00:18:44]",

And so I'm gonna inter splice these questions as we go through this. And, you just touched on Product Hunt and fundraising, and I'm curious if you were to go back and- and do it again.\nWould you raise money for Product Hunt, or would you not?\n[00:18:44] Ryan: Great question. So at the time, this is also the thing I ask [laughs] founders is why do you need to raise money? Like, what is it for? Surprisingly, some people like- I don't know, like they don't have a clear answer. For me, It was pretty obvious. Like we needed- we needed to hire, we needed people. Like, I- I didn't have personal capital to- to pay people.\nThere was an alternative, uh, reality where we actually built an open source. I was thinking like, “Is that possible?” Like we're building something for the tech community. I'm sure a lot of people would love to work on this. Could we build it in an open source way, but that like- that's really hard to do.\nAnd when you're building a company, you probably don't want to innovate on too many things, um, including like essentially how to build a product and build a team. Anyway, to answer your question, if I- I don't, I don't know what the right at the time raising money was the right decision because I- I wanted to hire and I didn't have personal capital.\nThere really weren't any other realistic options. I don't think. Today I could get further with my own- I'm not super wealthy and I'm super illiquid, but I have at least enough money where I could have funded, you know, maybe a year of development with this very small team. So today it might be a little bit different in which I might not raise venture capital because Product Hunt isn't the type of company that needs to raise a ton of money.\nIt's also one which is not, um, doesn't have like direct competitors in the sense of like an Uber and Lyft situation where raising is actually like kind of mandatory and you sort of have to build a massive war chest to compete. So there- there is a scenario where if I had more money, then maybe I wouldn't have raised venture capital. But yeah… there- there's a lot of other like decisions and other things that probably, uh, bigger mistakes I think I made. Um, not that raising money was a mistake by any means. It was, I think the right decision then, but yeah- there's a lot of learnings in hindsight's 2020.\n[00:20:31] Lenny: The point you made about like, you just needed money to like run the thing. I think that's so, so overlooked when people bash the idea of fundraising for a startup that maybe didn't need it. Like you just need money. Like you don't have just money to burn and go into debt. That makes sense to raise some money and see where this thing goes without really knowing where it's gonna go.\n[00:20:49] Ryan: Mm-hmm .Yeah, especially if it’s… I mean, I think it's very important to raise- raise from people who are aligned with you too. Meaning like, “Why does this person want to, whether it's an angel or a fund, invest in your fund?” Um, sorry, not fund… your company. When you go down a certain path, when you raise a series A, B, C, like you have different expectations and when you raise your proceed or seed round. So I think also understanding like, you know, what you're signing up for is super important.\n[00:21:16] Lenny: What kind of treadmill you’re- you're getting on.\n[00:21:18] Ryan: Yes. Yeah. ‘Cause you can't get off. I mean you can, but it's not like a company… I always say like when you're at a company, you can put in two weeks, notice one month notice. You can move on. As- as a founder or CEO, you can’t. Like, you really can't. Um, now you technically can… But you can’t, it- it's really, hard, um, to, to exit. \n[00:21:38] Lenny: Yeah. I look at the Airbnb founders. Who've been doing this for 15 years. Like, you know, they're doing well in life, but they also… it's very hard to leave.\n[00:21:46] Ryan: Mm-hmm.\n[00:21:38] Lenny: Yeah. Coming back to Product Hunt, people launch their product on Product Hunt, that's the thing, and I'm curious; founders are always so obsessed with launching and the power of a launch, and \"We gotta launch.” Do you think launches are worth it for a company? Is that something founders should be spending time on or is it often better just to not even spend time on that and just build slowly?\n[00:22:07] Ryan: Yeah, I- I always kinda ... Whenever I share like my perspective on stuff, I- I always enforce it always like it kinda depends, which is kinda like it sounds like a cop-out answer. So, it's- it's more ... My answers are usually more nuanced, and the thing about launching is- is going back to why are you raising money. What's the goal? Same thing. Why are you launching? And the the- a lot of people default to things like customer acquisition, \"Oh, I wanna acquire customers.\" But sometimes that's actually not- it's not useful. Launch sometimes doesn't help with that, but there are many other reasons why",

And the the- a lot of people default to things like customer acquisition, \"Oh, I wanna acquire customers.\" But sometimes that's actually not- it's not useful. Launch sometimes doesn't help with that, but there are many other reasons why you might wanna launch.\nSo, customer acquisition one, to get the word out. Another can be recruiting. So, by, you know, sharing your story, getting people excited, it might make it easier to recruit and get people excited about, you know, what you're building. Another is fundraising. Sometimes it can create momentum, you know, as- as other investors, they do read the news and they know that, you know, when this company is more public, they're might be more heat around it- a particular deal. Feedback is one. Um, the feedback from users, feedback just serendipitously and- and sort of another one is partnership. So, as you launch, you might also encounter more partnerships, more opportunities. I think there's a serendipitous effect of launching. So, I think understanding like what are the priorities of the business. Like if you- it might not be customer acquisition at all, it might be, \"We need to recruit and hire. Let's launch, so we can get the word out. Hopefully that will help land, you know, our next, you know, engineers, designers, or whoever.\" \nAnd then I also see there's like these little ti- side benefits too of launching that we see a lot through Product Hunt. One of them is team morale. And this- this might- I think this is overlooked. And I- I would also encourage [laughs] founders not to get their team too, um, I would say- you- you shouldn't be motivated to launch a product just to get like the likes on Twitter and the upvotes on Product Hunt, but there is a gr- like a powerful team morale and kinda building moment there where you can all celebrate what you've accomplished and what you built and put it out to the world. And, you know, somebody on the team can share, you know, the- the- the Product Hunt launch or, you know, some Tech Crunch article with their- their mom. And, you know, like that seems like a trivial kind of meaningless thing, but it actually matters for a lot of people. And then the other thing is SEO. So, if SEO's like a part of your strategy, having articles, positive articles, having a- a positive Product Hunt launch, things like that can also be helpful.\n[00:24:21] Lenny: That's awesome. I love that last point about morale. I- I hadn't thought about that. You've seen probably more launches than other person out there. How many launches of startups would you estimate you've kind of like seen or been [laughs], I don't know, an observer of? If that makes any sense. \n[00:24:38] Ryan: Um, I should look at our database on Product Hunt and see how many launches we've had 'cause it's gonna be a subset of that. I mean by seen, I- I- some of it's very high-level, but tens of thousands over the years.\n[00:24:48] Lenny: Okay, so when you think about that, do you have any sense of what correlates with a great launch versus just like an okay launch? What- what do founders miss with how they launch?\n[00:25:01] Ryan: Yeah, I mean the- this goes back to college and- and the a- you know, I won't go on my own rant about education, but in, uh, you know, English class and writing class, a lot of teachers teach people to write with big words and fill pages of content and basically not speak like a human. And so, one- one thing I've noticed among founders and just people in general is they tend to write like a- a PR person and not like a human and not like, you know, the- the way that I kind of describe kind of a frame of- of writing, maybe your tagline for Product Hunt, um, or for your launch in general is like how- how do your customers or your users describe your product to other people? Or another frame is how do you describe it to your friends? Like when you're just, you know, hanging out, like how do you describe what you do, what you built, what it's for? And that language, I think, resonates with people because it feels way more authentic.\nAnd the people that use buzzwords and- and vague language, it just doesn't click. People see right- people are sick of the PR [laughs] speech. And so, I think the language and the microcopy, copyrighting matters so much. And then there's a lot of other things around like we should go more to the product and less about the launch. Like do you really understand who you're building for? And do you understand how to communicate the value prop- like what is it in the mind of user? There's sort of a lot of, I guess, more strategic kinda like decisions that go into that- that, uh, before the launch.\n[00:26:22] Lenny: Imagine each of those, uh, points can be its own podcast and block post. [laughs] One of the questions that people asked me on Twitter was the classic, \"How do I get to number one on Product Hunt?\" So, my question to you is I know that's like ... There's not gonna be a silver bullet. Is there like a guide",

Yeah, so in the posts below, there's actually a link- links to a bunch of guides and FAQs and things like that. So, it's really easy to find like sort of the best practices there. The team also has like this checklist. So, once you launch, there's like a checklist of things, recommendations or tips. And I'm actually forgetting like what each of them are specifically right now, but some of the things that I've noticed that make a big difference is we've already talked about the tagline copy, that goes to, not only the post, but also the maker. Usually people tend to add like some introduction, some context. Uh, generally a lot of people will, they- they manufacture PR speak there too, and so speaking like a human, I think, is important. Also keeping it a little brief. Some people write essays, which might be interesting, but the reality is most consumers, especially people on Product Hunt, you know, they're- they're flipping through a bunch of ideas. They're looking for things that spark their curiosity and interest.\nAnd they probably not particularly interested in reading like an [laughs] essay, you know, from- from the makers. So, keeping that short, I think, is helpful. And then another big one is the gallery is- is often the first thing that someone is gonna see once they land on the page. And so, just naturally our eyes gravitate towards visuals. And some of the most interesting presentations I've seen is people use the gallery almost like a slideshow, um, like telling a story, where each slide is- is communicating like a different- well, a story of some sort. It could be like, \"Here's the before and after with our product,\" or \"Here's the evolution of what this product can do.\" There's many different ways to approach it, but like a really clean, you know, visually interesting story, um, can also be a great way to like capture people's interest in what you built.\n[00:28:21] Lenny: Awesome. That was very tactical and helpful. If you were to launch something on Product Hunt yourself, and it wasn't like hunted by Ryan Hoover, do you think you would get to the top?\n[00:28:30] Ryan: [laughs] I- I mean I don't know. It's- it's funny because if you ... We should do some like historical analysis on Product Hunt 'cause I'd be curious to know the actual numbers, but it varies all over the board. So, some people, they ask me, \"Hey, like I don't know, is Product Hunt like ... Do B2B companies do well there?\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, like a lo- m- probably more B2B companies than B2C companies actually,\" and so you see, you know, seemingly boring companies that tap into something that- that- that people find useful or resonate- resonates with them, um, can go to the top. And then you also see the weird, wacky stuff, you know, the- the silly apps also hit the top. So, I don't know, it really varies.\nAnd sometimes it's also driven by like the almost like the zeitgeist, like what do people find interesting right now? Like what's sparking people's interest? Because Product Hunt, on one side, you are potentially attracting people who might be future users and customers, partners, and so on, but it's also just a general kind of like zeitgeist of the early adopter tech community. Like what are they interested in? What do they find compelling in general?\n[00:29:34] Lenny: Got it. Okay, so I have a bunch of questions from Twitter that people [laughs] wanted to ask you. And so, let me ask you a few of those, and they're kind of a little bit all over the place, but we'll see- we'll see where this goes. Jessica Toye, who's a- she's a PM at Angel List, she's actually a friend. We were together at Airbnb. She asked a great question.\n[00:29:53] Ryan: Yeah. Jess- Jess is awesome. She- shout-out to Jess, she's like been super helpful on the Angel List side, so she's awesome.\n[00:29:59] Lenny: Amazing. Okay, she's the best. She asked what you learned as a PM that has helped you in your venture career.\n[00:30:06] Ryan: Yeah, um, yeah, so my- my background is, uh, marketing and then product management. Pretty quickly, uh, used to work in the gaming industry, which is like, I think, an- an awesome industry. Really hard to make it in that industry, but like amazing place to learn, and no, no, uh, I have so many biases, so I have to like be cautious of that, but I- I- having a product background, I think, is one of the most important aspects of early stage startup investing, meaning oftentimes, when you're building a new company, there are a lot of risks and there's a lot of important things to- to nail, but it all",

Really hard to make it in that industry, but like amazing place to learn, and no, no, uh, I have so many biases, so I have to like be cautious of that, but I- I- having a product background, I think, is one of the most important aspects of early stage startup investing, meaning oftentimes, when you're building a new company, there are a lot of risks and there's a lot of important things to- to nail, but it all ultimately comes down to the product that you're building. And so, I think having a product management or a product background is helpful. And one, having more, I guess, perspective in evaluating different ideas and- and arguably more important, uh, how the founder thinks about things. So, it might be less about me evaluating the- the- the market need for this particular idea, but it's what's the thought process and how did this founder come to these product ideas and these insights. And so, I think having a product management background is helpful for that, and I don't know, I also just find it really fun to jam on product with founders. And when it's early, early days, there- there's more opportunity to create some sort of impact or, you know, help shape the product in- in a slight way.[00:31:20] \nLenny: Awesome. Basically if you're a PM, you've got a lot of the skills that you need to be a founder.\n[00:31:24] Ryan: Founder and- and arguably, investor, um, as well.\n[00:31:27] Lenny: Oh, and that's right. Okay. So, uh, Leo of Sousa Ventures, who's also an awesome dude, uh, he asked if you could go back and-\n[00:31:35] Ryan: I saw Leo in, uh, Miami, uh, not long ago.\n[00:31:39] Lenny: Oh yeah. He moved to Miami too. Oh my God. Everyone's over there. Okay, so [laughs], uh, he asked if you could go back and build Product Hunt again, what would you do differently? We talked a bit about this, but anything else?\n[00:31:50] Ryan: Yeah. Um, I've been thinking a lot about this actually lately. And, um, yeah, I mean there's a few things. Uh, one, Product Hunt, in the very beginning, and still today, is very much focused on tech, and there was, at one point, ambition to expand beyond tech into all different types of, you know, categories of products. So, you know, we experimented with podcasts actually, podcast discovery.\nWe experimented in video game discovery, we experimented with book discovery, and the thesis there was, \"Okay, this could be actually discovery platform for all of these communities to discover all these different products,\" and I think there was a lot of good ideas in that. However, I severely underestimated how difficult it would be to do two things: one, the product experience on Product Hunt is very different than how you would wanna discover video games or maybe, in the future, fashion and a bunch of other types of products out there.\nAnd two, it's really difficult to translate a community and expand into other communities. Like some- some have done it. Like Reddit is maybe a great example, where Reddit has this massive [laughs] long tail of, you know, every kinda community you can imagine, but very few companies and platforms can actually do that. So, that's one- one regret is we should not have tried to expand horizontally. We should've just focused entirely vertically and- and served the tech community, you know, better and- and with more things, which is effectively what we're doing now. Another regret, another thing I would've changed is I would've- I would've actually tried to monetize and generated revenue sooner. We- we raised a seed in a series A and we had capital to grow, and we didn't actually try to make money until after we required Angel List.\nAnd my thinking at the time was, and to some extent, there's some truth to this, is like everything you prioritize is at the cost of something else. You know, you- you're essentially taking focus from one thing and directing it to something else. And what mattered most was growth and to grow the community, but what I really should've done is dedicated maybe 10% of our focus on revenue generation because, you know, it was- once we started generating revenue, we- we did so very quickly, and we go to cashflow, break even, I wanna say a year, maybe 12 months after we started generating revenue. So, if we would've started in 2014 to make some money, we coulda been cashflow, break even, you know, maybe 2015, 2016, which would've just given us a lot of flexibility in kind of owning your own destiny and proving out some of the business model itself. \nAnd then like the last thing, uh, I've been thinking about this lately is- is delegation is- is a classic founder challenge. You know, I- I'm just generally a controlling person. That's something I'm working on. And it's really hard sometimes when I have such strong opinions, and I'm very particular about certain things, uh, fully delegate and fully trust everybody. Not necessarily- we have an amazing team. Like I worked with some amazing people, still people that are Product Hunt today like six, seven years later. It wasn't anything about the skills of the team. It was just my own trust and my own delegation, and what I should've done is, you know, up until shortly before I left, I was editing the newsletter every morning, for example, like every morning. I was waking up, you know, 5 a.m.,",

I mean that's just kinda silly, you know, to be doing that so many years later after starting.\n[00:35:02] Lenny: I totally get that drive to just make sure everything you're putting out and that your company's putting out is topnotch. I- I have the same feeling, and it is hard to [laughs] let go and just like, \"That's not perfect, but I'm gonna- I'm gonna be okay with that, a few other things.\"\n[00:35:16] Ryan: Mm-hmm. Yeah. It's- it's really hard, and I think it's a tendency that is, uh, in some ways, it's- it's good in that you care so much about the product as a founder. You care so much about what you're building. You care so much about the details, uh, and you need that kind of like almost OCD-like, uh, behavior, however, you also just can't scale yourself nor are you the best person at everything. So, I- I don't know. With hindsight I'm like, \"All right, I should've delegated more. I should've trusted people more.\" And yeah, they'll- there will be more mistakes. I make mistakes all the time, but at the end, it's gonna be way net positive because you kind of have to [inaudible 00:31:30] your company anyway.\n[00:35:54] Lenny: It’s a good segue to a question Harry Stubbings asked that he finds interesting always. What's the most painful lesson that you've learned and, but that you're also happy about to have gone through?\n[00:36:05] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, there's ... I actually- I recently in the past couple weeks, wrote a blog post, that I'm not really able to publish 'cause it's- it's basically when you- there's certain things I wanna share that it- it- it can make things challenging and complicated for others. So, I didn't wanna put anyone else in- in a pickle. So, someday maybe I'll publish this post, but to speak more vaguely about it, like there's some hard- really hard times in Product Hunt, like we- we have all faced in- in different ways as founders, not even just as founders [laughs], just as people. Oh, yeah, there's some times where I felt physically ill, many different moments in- in Product Hunt. And um, it was just really tough, and you know, you- I don't know if- I don't know how to articulate that- that feeling but that flutter in your stomach that you wake up with in the morning of just anxiety and stress and- and worry.\nBeing a CEO or a founder makes it slightly harder in some ways because you still have to put on this mask. You have to put on this face of confidence externally and- and internally as well, where people need to trust you. You- you also don't wanna subject them to the same anxiety that you're feeling and be 100% transparent. So, it's- it's a struggle because, I think, I h- I don't know, I value authenticity so much, and I- I kinda like thrive around people who are authentic, however, there's this like tension with- with being a founder or CEO where you can necessarily share everything. So, anyway, everyone's gone through hardship building a company. You know, the positive aspect of that is like if- I- I think, hopefully growing some empathy for founders who are going through hard situations. I think it's made me a little bit stronger, maybe thicker-skinned for certain things. It just provided more- more perspective, you know, into the company kind of like building journey.\n[00:37:41] Lenny: Okay, listen to this.

Yeah. It's kind of y- y- like a lot of things, you know, uh, what doesn't break you makes you stronger to some extent. So, it didn't break me, uh, it just scarred me a little bit but didn't break me.

For better or worse.\n[00:38:57] Lenny: [laughs] Maybe one last question from- from Twitter, Twitteratis. From Sandeep. He just wanted to know what- what have you found matters most to you or mattered most to you in life and in business versus what you thought would matter most?\n[00:39:09] Ryan: Yeah, um, still figuring it out. I'm- I'm- I'm still asking the- the old stereotypical questions like, \"What- what the heck is the meaning of life? Like what am I here for?\" [laughs] All those things.\n[00:39:19] Lenny: Let me know when you figured it out. \n[00:39:20] Ryan: Yeah. And maybe, maybe there is no answer. Maybe the question is, is actually, um, doesn't matter. So I mean, if I'm honest, I'm still figuring all those things out.\nYeah. And maybe- maybe there is no answer. Um, maybe the question is- is actually it doesn't matter. Um, so I mean if I'm honest, I'm still figuring all those things out. I mean I think in- in life, some of the things that I've reflected on is, uh, so damn cliché, but sometimes when cliches are true is like friends and authentic relationships have been, I don't know, they just matter so much, I think. And the older I get too, it's less about, I don't know, I care less about having a lot of friends and more about a few deep, close relationships. And I don't know, I feel like that's very different than like middle school Ryan or like, you know, when you're in- on the playground metaphorically speaking, like where everyone's tryin' to be popular and, you know, meet a lot of people. And even- even joining and- and being, you know, uh, in San Francisco in the tech community, you wanna meet a lot of people and network and all- do all those things, that- that's less interesting to me and less important.\nAnd then, more on the business side, the thing I've been thinking about is like, and I think this is obvious to a lot of people, but I think there's some nuances to it, which is momentum matters so much. And momentum is reflexive in that, you know, high momentum leads to more high momentum. Low momentum leads to more low momentum because there's this energy that- that kinda goes through companies where, when there is momentum, when people are shipping, when things are going well, other people feel that energy, and they wanna do the same, but in the reverse, someone who might be slowing things down, not shipping, not really performing very well, that actually does the reverse too. It- it might lead other people to- to feel less motivated or care less. And so, I don't know, momentum is- is this weird thing that, you know, you- arguably, it's one of the most important things in early-stage startups. And of course, it's an- an input to a lot of things, uh, but it's just so important to nail.\n[00:41:00] Lenny: Mark Andreessen talks about that- that last point that ... There's like a word for it that I forget, that a company is either becoming a gravity and pulling in all resources and funding and attention or losing it. And it's really important as a company to know which one of those are you, and as an investor, you often wanna bet on the company that's just like they're just becoming the center of gravity here, and there's not a lot you can do to change that once they reach a certain point.\n[00:41:24] Ryan: Yeah. Yeah, that's a really good point. I mean the- it also mirrors with like the power law of investing where it's- it's, in most people's situation, it's one company is returning ... You can invest in 100 companies, and one of those companies is probably gonna return three to five X in the returns of all the others, maybe combined in some cases. So, it's- it's wild.\n[00:41:45] Lenny: On the first point that you made earlier about cliches and platitudes, it reminds me, Michael Pollan has this point that he makes that like cliches and platitudes are cliches and platitudes because we've heard 'em so many times but that- because they're true. People just say 'em because they're so true. And as much as we don't wanna hear them, like there's a reason that we hear them again and again. Uh, I had a similar recognition when I was on a little psychedelic journey where I'm just like, \"Man, love is all you need. Love is all you need, man.”\n[00:42:15] Ryan: [laughs] Yeah.\n[00:42:16] Lenny: Okay, people have figured that out. But I was like, I feel that, I feel that right now. But it's true. That's why people- that's why f- [laughs] we're like, \"Okay, shut up. I heard that. That's in a song.\"\n[00:42:25",

That's in a song.\"\n[00:42:25] Ryan: [laughs] Yeah, it's- I was listening to- to a podcast, uh, about someone who was basically describing like psychedelics as a gateway into like meditation and- and everything and how it can be one of those things that makes people ... It- it- a lot of people who take psychedelics come across as another hippie cliché like person who like repeats the same things we've all heard many, many times, but there's a reason why there's a pattern there. And, you know, he describes like psychedelics as- as one way to feel that and learn that- that feeling that you can't achieve with- with meditation, you know, with experience.\n[00:42:56] Lenny: Yeah, I think Sam Harris talks about this where you could either meditate for five, 10 years to work your way up the mountain towards, you know, enlightenment, or you could just take some psychedelics, visit it for a little moment, see what it's like, and then [laughs]- and then-\n[00:43:09] Ryan: Mm-hmm.\n[00:43:09] Lenny: be motivated to, to work on getting there more naturally\n[00:43:12] Ryan: Yeah.\n[00:43:13] Lenny: This is a good time to play a little game that I invented just for you. Okay, so you're the founder of Product Hunt. Okay. And, on Product Hunt, people up vote ideas that they like best. And so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give you two options and you tell me which you'd rather— which you'd up vote and it'll make sense once we get going. [laughs]\nThat sound good.\n[00:43:33] Ryan: Okay, cool. Let's do it.\n[00:43:35] Lenny: Okay. TikTok or Instagram Reels?\n[00:43:38] Ryan: And, and is context setting, are these within the context of products? I, I like and know, or\n[00:43:43] Lenny: Products you would choose to use that you like better... yeah. Not like which will do business— better business. Yeah. \n[00:43:50] Ryan: Okay. Okay. Got it. TikTok's for me. It's funny, reels, I kind of joke with, with Susie, my girlfriend, I joke that it's like, reels is like, TikTok, but like two weeks late.\nUh, it's not entirely true, but I feel like I see a lot of TikTok videos on Instagram reels. Like after, you know, weeks after they've been published.\n[00:44:08] Lenny: We'll see, I have some friends that work on reels and I'm excited to see where they go. Okay, next- LaCroix or Topo Chico.\n[00:44:15] Ryan: Ooh, this is a tough because I- I- I'm generally a La Croix kinda person, but Topo Chico, I like the bottle. So, when Topo Chico's available, I'll go Topo Chico. I'm sorry, La Croix.\n[00:44:26] Lenny: [laughs] I- I totally get that. My wife's a huge Topo Chico fan. We have many, many [laughs] bottles. They're beautiful. They've- kind of changed a bit. They're like super clear now, they used to have a little, a little tint.\n[00:44:36] Ryan: Hmm. \n[00:44:37] Lenny: Very important topics. Yeah. Okay. Next, next up, Bay Area or Los Angeles?\n[00:44:43] Ryan: Uh, Los Angeles. Although, it depends on the- the, so here's my goals, if- if I was, you know, a new college grad or someone young and- and new in kind of the tech industry, definitely San Francisco. You'll create a lot of serendipity. You'll- you'll meet a lot of people, but from a lifestyle perspective, LA. Um, LA, I just find more enjoyable, weather's better, there's hiking, housing is cheaper. So, LA today, San Francisco, 10 years ago.\n[00:45:09] Lenny: Very nuanced dancer. I knew you were gonna say LA, and so, next is East Side LA or West Side LA?\n[00:45:16] Ryan: I don't know. We- we lived in Hollywood up in the hills for a while. So, I don't know if that's East or West, but wherever that is, big fan.\n[00:45:24] Lenny: I guess that's West, right? It's not near the water. That's a really good question. Hollywood Hills, all right, that'll be a third [laughs] option. Okay, electric bike or regular bike.\n[00:45:34] Ryan: Nothing against electric bikes, but I feel like if- if your goal is to get exercise, then just get a regular bike, but I don't have either. I have a- a, um, recumbent bike at home that I use for exercise. The reason why it's recumbent and not like a Peloton where you sit",

The reason why it's recumbent and not like a Peloton where you sit up is 'cause I can do emails and work [laughs] because while I'm exercising.\n[00:45:53] Lenny: Wow. Very productive. Okay. Next, dark mode or light mode?\n[00:45:58] Ryan: Light mode, I've never used dark mode like ever. Actually I take that back. Tweet Deck is the only dark mode kind of app that I use. But- \n[00:46:06] Lenny: Wow. \n[00:46:07] Ryan: I don't know. If- if a founder is prioritizing dark mode before they have product market fit too, it's like a big red flag for me. That's a little bit of a hot take. Some people are gonna hate me for that, but I don't know. I don't think dark mode matters for like 99% of people.\n[00:46:22] Lenny: Wow. Big, big, hot take. What if they just go dark [laughs] and there's no light mode. Does that count against them?\n[00:46:28] Ryan: Uh, Yeah, that's fine. As long as it's just one mode, um, it's the teams that prioritize all these, like small things that don't matter before the product is actually like useful for people or, or that that's, that is where I like my product manager hat comes in and I'm like, is this like the highest on your priority list?\nI don't know. Now big asterisks, it's all contextual. Sometimes. Like the audience you're building for really cares about dark mode. Like if you're building for developers, maybe you need dark mode, or, or some version of it, but, but yeah, I'm, I'm light mode.\n[00:46:57] Lenny: Awesome. Okay. [laughs] Did not expect that, love it. Okay, two more. Wash the dish right away or let it soak in the sink?\n[00:47:04] Ryan: [laughs] Um, I'm looking at the sink over here. There might be dishes in there, so that'll be my answer. I got a bad habit.\n[00:47:11] Lenny: No, I think there's- there's power in letting it soak. I get it. I respect that.\n[00:47:15] Ryan: [laughs] That’s what I'll tell Susie next time. There's power. Lenny said there's power in soaked dishes.\n[00:47:20] Lenny: There's physics. It's soaking. Okay. Last one, Web3 or Web5?\n[00:47:25] Ryan: Mm, uh, I don't know what happened to Web4, so I don't know, maybe- maybe we'll split the difference, so I'm gonna go Web4.\n[00:47:31] Lenny: Okay. We did it. [laughs] That was the inaugural addition of which would you rather up vote? Amazing. You killed it.\n[00:47:38] Ryan: There you go go. I like this. All right. It's kind of a fun, this could, this could be a fun little segment, I think for a lot of things.\n[00:47:45] Lenny: Yeah. It'll plug Product Hunt. It'll be great. We'll see [laughs] where this goes. This replaced my lightning round, which I experiment with. Okay. But actually I have other questions I want to get through before we, before I let you go. If that's cool.\nThere's kinda two topics. One is around consumer startups and just a few things that I've been learning there and then angel investing and then- and then we wrap.\nSo around consumer. By the time this post comes out, I'll have released some portions of the series that I'm working on, on kickstarting and scaling consumer business. And there's a few things I've learned there that I just wanted to get your take on. One is that, and we talked a bit about this just like 99% of consumer apps seem to just like, not work, especially if they're venture scale, if they raise money, just like just a reminder of how hard consumer is like, when is the last consumer app that really took off.\nAnd so I just wanted to get your thoughts— is what's your take there? What should founders do that are starting a consumer company?\n[00:48:40] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, it's tough. I mean there's- there's obviously consumer is pretty broad, so there's like different levels of difficulty, I think. Um, the consumer social or gaming, like games, building games, is probably like the- the- the hardest and the one filled with the most failures. And I think a lot of that is because, I think a few things, I think one monetization is generally harder than like a B2B company. Historically, a lot of it's been like advertising driven, and to do that, you have to first get to massive scale for advertisers to really care. And then you have to, you know, double it and double it and double it [laughs] again. So, monetization is super tough, versus a B2B company, it's like people have a problem, they have a need, they are willing to give you money, you know, on day-",

And then you have to, you know, double it and double it and double it [laughs] again. So, monetization is super tough, versus a B2B company, it's like people have a problem, they have a need, they are willing to give you money, you know, on day- day one.\nThe other thing about consumer that's tough is you're- you're always fighting different, essentially you're fighting for attention. And so, you might be some consumer social company, but you're- you're kind of like competing with Netflix too, which isn't in your direct domain, but like people could be watching Netflix, or they could be using your product or- or your social app, let's say. So, now you're competing with so many different things. Many of those are incumbents where the consumer also has like built-in habits, routines. Like this is a big- big part about consumers too is eventually you wanna be like an internal trigger in someone's mind where they- they just, without even thinking, they go and use your product or services for some reason. Usually, you don't start that way. You need like external triggers to like pull people in, but eventually you have to get to that point. So, how do you overcome those internal triggers they have for other services, other products? It's really, really hard. \nAnd- and then I think a lot of it is, um, like B2B companies, usually you- you have a clear like problem that you're solving. And you could talk to customers, you could understand what are their current behaviors, what- what solutions are they using now, what do they like about them, what do they not like about them whereas, consumer, there's a little bit of that, but it's- it's fuzzier. You know, if you take, um, like Twitter and you kind of even ask someone like, \"Why do you use Twitter and like w-\" people will have different answers that are all kind of like fuzzy. And they ultimately tend to come down to some sort of like innate human desire. Like it could be, uh, for Twitter, it could be about like, \"I wanna be informed with what's happening in the world,\" or it could be, \"I want to feel less lonely or connected to more people,\" or something like that whereas, if you go to, let's say DocuSign, I think is a great example, of a B2B company, it's like super simple. [laughs] \nIt's like a- a way to get legal docs signed online. That's- that's what it does. It's a thing that people have to do. It's very clear like what it solves. And so, B2B's just like easier to navigate that idea maze. And so, with consumer, you- your- your first blog post on this topic touches a lot on the idea side. And I- I, a lot of it resonated with me, especially the- the insight piece. Like what is- what is the insight that you, as a founder, have to build this thing? Because I think it's really hard to build a consumer company without some sort of unique insight, maybe impossible. And you can get that in many different ways. It could be through your own experiences. I used to write like a problem journal. Like just when things annoyed me or when things were like less efficient, I would write it down as like a note. And I didn't try to solve it. I didn't- didn't say, \"Oh, here's the solution.\" I was just like, \"This is annoying.\" \nLike, in San Francisco, one example is a lot of people don't have laundry like in their unit. So, I'm like, \"That's kind of annoying. Like that's a problem. Maybe there's a solution out there.\" So, things like that. And I know, there's- there's- there's a bunch of different ways, like, uh, y- your- your blog post does a better summary, I think, of like the different ways different companies like ideated and came up with their ideas, but yeah, many different ways to navigate it but needs an insight of some sort.\n[00:52:09] Lenny: Awesome. I hadn't heard that, u- u- uh, that pr- problem journal idea. I was gonna ask you if you have any suggestions for how to come up with a startup idea, and that's a really interesting one. Is there- yeah, so I guess it'd be cool to hear where that came from and what that led to? Or if there's anything else you found to be useful around that?\n[00:52:23] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, the problem journal is one. And again, like I think it's helpful, not to try to come up with the solution, but just write- just simply write down the problem you- you observed or experienced. Another one I think's interesting is just to like immerse yourself in different communities. Ideally, like maybe like seemingly niche or weird long tail communities. It doesn't have to be that necessarily, but that might be where you'll see more unique insights or- or gather more insights, and you could do that through, I don't know, I'm just thinking subreddits, meeting a lot of people who are like really excited some other thing. It could be like some weird robotics like niche, hobbyist community, for example. And a lot of that, I think, will- will hone or just like create serendipity for ideas. You might see patterns, or you might see, you know, if problem statements emerge from many people in that community that are facing similar things.\nAnd then there's like the other- other component too,",

And a lot of that, I think, will- will hone or just like create serendipity for ideas. You might see patterns, or you might see, you know, if problem statements emerge from many people in that community that are facing similar things.\nAnd then there's like the other- other component too, which is really about like observing trends and- and changes, whether it's like a consumer behavior shift. Let's take an obvious one. Today is like distributed working. So, five- five years ago when the Weekend Fund started, that was one of our themes. It was like I- I- I think distributed working will be on the rise for a number of reasons. One, you know, i- it's harder and harder to recruit. Two, there's a subset of people who really valuable that flexibility and autonomy. And then fast forward, we had COVID, so like we had remote working, and- and now, that's a huge consumer behavior shift. Not just in how people work but also, like going to your Airbnb like world, like Airbnb has shifted their entire product to support more of this remote working kind of lifestyle, just the way that the- the homepage is now more of a catalog of places that you could explore at different times of the year versus Airbnb before was more like, \"I have a very specific vacation trip that I wanna take during these days in these areas.\"\nIt's like a very different like browsing kind of experience. So, that's just one example. Consumer behavior shifts is one thing to observe. The other is technology shifts. So, what- what new thing can you build today that couldn't be built yesterday? And so, there's- there's a bunch of categories around there, like Web3, AI, you know. The biggest shift that we've seen is- is mobile in like early 2010s, um, 'ish, that unlocked a whole- whole bunch of things. So, so, yeah, I think it's observing those shifts and those changes. Last thing I'll say on that is like I think startups, since there are more and more people building companies and technology, there's essentially more efficiency. It's certainly not a- an efficient, super efficient market, but there is more efficiency in problem discovery and- and- and solution exploration. And so, for that reason, you need even more reasons for things to- sort of answers to the, \"Why now?\"\nLike what's changed? What insight do you have? Why doesn't this exist already? 'Cause a bunch of people are trying to build something in the space most likely. Just a lot of what we think about, especially on the investing side, when we talk to founders.\n[00:55:14] Lenny: Wow. There's s- way too much good advice there. Have you written this down anywhere? Is there a Tweet thread people can find like your kind of approach to coming up with an idea?\n[00:55:22] Ryan: I have not, I don't think so. \n[00:55:24] Lenny: Cool. All right. Now we have to-\n[00:55:26] Ryan: Blog post for the future.\n[00:55:27] Lenny: Yeah. Or this is the, uh, this is the- the- the content for people to save and use. Thanks for sharing all that. That was really helpful. One other question I wanted to ask you along these lines is around the target audience and, uh, something ... A- an insight that we both share is that it's really important to get really narrow, whatever you focus on initially, as a start up, and it's, for founders, it's often so counterintuitive, they're like, you know, it's like, \"Oh my god, why should I focus on the 1000 people? Or 10000 type people-\n... Versus the millions that might wanna use this thing?\" What's your sense, and where have you kind of seen that become important? Just the idea of getting very narrow of how you're going after.\n[00:56:05] Ryan: Yeah, it's, effectively, the more narrow you're- you're generally, and this is where I throw in the big asterisks, like not for everything, there's always contextual differences, but generally, the easier it is to build a great solution for those people, because now you can actually hone in the product experience, the messaging, and everything to serve exactly those people. And it can help with the product side, it can help with the marketing and go-to market where you- you're messaging ... When people land on your homepage, you don't need to create kind of a broader kind of like value prop to everybody, but really, you can focus on like what is the- the problem this particular audience or community is- is facing. And so, generally, it's just easier.\nNow there is always that challenge of like, \"Well, is this too small? Is it too- too much of a niche if- if my goal is to build like a massive company?\" My bias is not to worry too much about that because what you probably find is, over time, opportunities to expand beyond that. You'll see parallels, maybe to other communities or to other problems. And a lot of companies, you know, eventually expand well beyond that. Like I'll go back to Airbnb, you know the story way better than I do, but you know, initially, it was just like, you know, basically couches and extra rooms in houses. And like a lot of people, most people in the US would not do that. Like my parents, not- not in a million years. Even me, like I don't wanna like stay in some stranger",

And like a lot of people, most people in the US would not do that. Like my parents, not- not in a million years. Even me, like I don't wanna like stay in some stranger's like room. I want my own space, my own house. So, that- that probably at the time seemed really niche and like small, but obviously, they extended- extended well beyond that.\nNow- now I view Airbnb as like housing in generally speaking. Like their- their TM is housing in- in my mind, which they haven't yet exp- expanded into like real estate sales or like longterm rentals, per se, but like that- that's a possibility.\n[00:57:51] Lenny: This is a good segue to the last topic I wanted to touch on, investing, which I believe you do full-time. Would you say that it's- your full-time gig now?\n[00:57:59] Ryan: Yeah, yeah, it is. Yeah, I'm spending all my time there, and yeah.\n[00:58:02] Lenny: Cool. So, from what I can tell, the Weekend Fund is killin' it. I'm not an LP, but it feels like it's kind of this underrated juggernaut that's just doing very well. And so, I wanted to ask you a couple questions along these lines. One is what have you learned about investing, angel investing? Especially what's most surprised you?\n[00:58:20] Ryan: I mean I feel like there's a lot ... A lot we've learned. So, there's- there's things on the operational side. Like running a fund, there's a bunch of things that go into it, from LP communications, LP fundraising. There's also like ... Vedika who works with me on the fund side, she, um, she describes it as like hygiene. There's also good hygiene when it comes to running a fund. For example, you know, when you meet a founder, you- you- you should get back to them. [laughs] Like if it's a pass, you should let them know. And then there's a lot of different ways that you can do that. Some people, you know, might just say like \"pass,\" and that's not very encouraging to a founder if they gave you no context, no details. There's also an element of hygiene, which is you always follow up with the person that introduced us to that company. And we just feel it's kinda like that's what we appreciate.\n\nLike we like to kinda know what happened, like s- have them close the loop. And so, there's like good hygiene, operational things that we've learned and kinda honed over- over the years. I mean the biggest surprise, the biggest surprise has probably been ... I gotta be careful of how this is interpreted in some ways, but it's ... There are cases when I didn't think the company would make it. I- uh, either the product wasn't working, and you know, many months had passed, and it was very clear that they're- they- well, to me, I thought it was clear that, okay, that this probably isn't gonna work out. In my head I kinda wrote it off. And then that company either pivoted or- or some m- like massive partnership or MMA event came through out of nowhere, and so I- I guess the learning is like never count a portfolio company out until it's over.\nAnd, you know, uh, that relies on, of course, backing founders that are very resilient and creative and- and, you know, driven to- to create momentum, you know, out of nothing, but- but that's been surprising to me. And it makes me kind of excited because, you know, we invested in over 110 companies now and it's- it's fun to be able to kinda see behind-the-scenes a little bit how all these things kind of play out, both the good and the bad.\n[01:00:13] Lenny: That's such an inspiring takeaway. Does that change how you invest? Like to me, that's like, \"All right, I guess I should just take more bets on founders that are awesome.\" Although, I find just founder bets, it's like a very expensive hobby/approach because there's so there's so many great founders. How is that informed how you invest seeing that happen?\n[01:00:33] Ryan: I would say we don't, we don't have like, um, it's again, my cop out it's contextual kind of answer. Like, you know, some people are like, \"We are a team first only.\" Some are, \"We're market first.\" Some are, \"We're product first.\" And we- we look at everything kind of holistically, and I think the evaluation of the product is- is sort of a reflection on the team. So, our- our assessment of the thinking behind the product that they built today and maybe some of the traction is a reflection on like the team's abilities and like the thought processes.\nSo, we try to look at it holistically in, um, I mean, yeah, I mean every investor would say like, \"Yeah, we wanna back, you know, resilient founders that are very driven, insightful, and all those things,\" of course. But it's also sometimes hard to like fully evaluate that, unless you really know that person. So, so, we try to- to- to take as much data around like how the product is working and how they made those decisions leading up to this to- to evaluate the team sort of indirectly.\n[01:",

One, going back to the consumer social kind of thing, he's somebody I've known for many, many years. One of the most talented like designers, engineers, product builders. And I've just been waiting for him to start a company and- and so, that was- that was one of those, \"I'm gonna bet on you because I believe in you. I'm not sure about this first idea, uh, you know, who am I to judge? But I don't know if that's gonna be it,\" but [laughs] he's probably gonna launch 10 apps, and the 11th is gonna be a massive success. And so, that's sort of the- the way I think about those consumer social founder first bets.\n[01:02:10] Lenny: I love that. Last question along these lines, for someone that's hoping to get into investing or angel investing in the near future, do you have any advice for folks around that?\n[01:02:20] Ryan: Yeah, actually, I wrote a tweet storm and like converted it to a blog post on this 'cause we've get- gotten a lot of ... You probably as well, get a lot of emails or people saying, \"Hey, I'm thinking about raising a fund. Like how should I do that?\" or \"I wanna get into- to venture. I wanna start investing. Like what advice do you have?\" So, yeah, I wrote a blog post on this, and there's many different ways to invest. There's, you know, angel investing is one. So, great thing about that is if you have the capital to angel invest, you can do it today, tomorrow. Like you- there- there's no- no sign-offs required. You have maximum flexibility, but of course, you need to have disposable income. You need to be able to- [laughs] be willing to lose all of it and then hopefully you, you know, you'll ma- you'll be on the other side of that and make some money in 10 years. \n It takes a long time. There's scouting; that's another option. And there are more and more scout funds probably than ever before right now, in different flavors. Some of them are like dedicated kind of scout programs where you have capital to deploy on your own, some are more like you still need approval, but you send the deals, and you get carry on those deals in many cases. Those have pros and cons too. Like they're easier to start and get into than raising a fund typically for most people, but you also are sort of reliant on that- that program or that fund. Um, you might have less autonomy in what you can invest in and what you can't. And then there's a few others; there's SPVs is- is one angle, which works really well for a lot of people. So, um, for those that maybe don't know and- and listening to this right now, SPVs are essentially like a single vehicle, um, investment into one company.\nSo, you raise money from LPs, from other investors, to invest in this specific company. And there are a few great things about that. Like one, you get deal-by-deal carry, meaning like the- the outcome of that company is- is you get paid when they exit essentially, assuming there's a positive outcome versus a fund, like you have to return the entire fund first. Two, it allows you to also bring in maybe very strategic, helpful people into that particular round for that company, which can actually be a- a strong value add for that founder. The biggest trade-off is it's a lot of work sometimes. You- you have to basically do a fundraiser [laughs] every couple you invest in, and that's super time-consuming for a lot of people. And then the last thing is like r- rai- raising a fund.\nSo, that's the decision that I decided back in 2017 is I wanted to raise a fund. It's a lot more work to raise the capital and- and- and there's a lot more responsibility in managing funds and so on and so forth, but it provided me with the most flexibility and- and a way to deploy many checks into many companies, especially when I didn't and still don't have like a ton of money to angel invest. So, yeah, those are like different options. Like I think my blog post goes into more like pros and cons for each of those things, but the last thing I'll say actually is, let's say, none of those are really an option. You- you- you don't wanna start a fund. You don't have enough relationships to do SPVs. You- for whatever reason, you can't do a scout. You don't have any money to angel invest. One thing you can also do is just like pretend angel invest. [laughs] And that doesn't mean that you're meeting the founder and like writing a check, but you can write memos, or you can like almost create a fantasy portfolio.\nAnd this is what Vedika, before she joined- joined me, was doing to some extent. She was writing mem",

[laughs] And that doesn't mean that you're meeting the founder and like writing a check, but you can write memos, or you can like almost create a fantasy portfolio.\nAnd this is what Vedika, before she joined- joined me, was doing to some extent. She was writing memos about companies she was excited about. And in some ways, she was like doing the job before getting the job, and anyone can do that today. And that can be helpful too if you're applying or trying to prove your- your- your abilities. You could say, \"Hey, here are the memos. Here are the companies that I would have invested in, you know, if I had the opportunity, and, you know, here's my thought process behind that.\"\n[01:05:49] Lenny: I love that. I'm curious about the logistics of knowing the prices of all these startups, but anyway, we don't have to get into all of [laughs] that. That's an awesome idea. I've seen people on Twitter do that too. What's- where do you think this all goes for you? Are you thinking of increasing the fund? That's basically the last question. Just, yeah, what's- what’s- the future of Ryan- Ryan Hoover at this point, as far as [laughs] you know?\n\n[01:06:08] Ryan: Yeah, still- still figuring out the meaning of life, as we established earlier.\n[01:06:12] Lenny: I thought we cracked that one. \n[01:06:13] Ryan: Yeah, yeah. I'll let you know when I figure it out.\n[01:06:15] Lenny: Okay.\n[01:06:16] Ryan: Um, uh, [laughs], um, yeah, we're on our third fund right now. We're actually about 30, 35% deployed, so we have plenty of- of capital, and we're not gonna be raising any time soon. Yeah, we're just investing in early stage companies right now, but yeah, when I fast forward like longer term, I don't know. I will always be investing. I'm also more of a fan of maintaining a smaller fund. Our latest fund is 21 million, and that might ... I might change my mind on this, but that might be the biggest fund we ever raise. I might keep it around that same size for the next one because it really allows us to be f- really collaborative. We can write smaller checks. We can fit into competitive deals. I think it's a better product for founders. Like we're not tryin' to take the entire round. We can, you know, try to bring on the Lennys of the world as co-investors, things like that. \nAnd so, investing will always be a part of my future, but I also love building. Building is- is the most fun, so creating something is- whether it's a company ... I don't know- I don't know what it is. I'm not even gonna call it a company, but building something is hopefully in my future. I just gotta figure out the right idea. And maybe, maybe reflect on your blog post too on the idea generation stuff that you shared 'cause that- that is helpful.\n[01:07:22] Lenny: As long as you let me invest all is good. \n[01:07:27] Ryan: [laughs] I don't know- I don't know if I'll- part of me is like, \"Do I ever wanna raise from venture?\" Now it depends on the idea. If- if I need it, if it's required strategically, then yes, but to be quite honest, maybe I shouldn't say this, like I'm kind of really interested in just owning something 100% and you can always raise venture later. Like it- it's a one-way door, so I kinda wanna delay that door, you know, for whatever I build next, if I can.\n[01:07:53] Lenny: I 100% get that. That's how life is with this newsletter operation and I highly recommend it.\n[01:07:59] Ryan: Yeah. \n[01:07:59] Lenny: If you can pull it off. Okay. Um, that's it. Just a couple- just where can people find you online? It's kind of a dumb question 'cause you're very easy to find, but where do people go to learn more if they wanna reach out? And then- and then how can listeners be useful to you?\n[01:08:14] Ryan: Yeah, I'm just, uh, easy to find. R- Rhoover on Twitter, Ryanhoover.me, simple website. I have a bunch of old blog posts on there, probably with a bunch of broken links and broken images, but it's there. The content's there. I don't know. We're- we're investing- we're investing in the early stage companies, B2B, B2C. If you're building something weird, I don't know, DM me, email me, I'm around.\n[01:08:35] Lenny: Amazing. Ryan, thank you so much for being here. It's kind of a surreal experience interviewing you. And I'm really honored that you came, and I can't wait for people to hear this. I'm really happy about all the nuggets that [laughs] I was able to extract out of your head, and thank you for sharing them. Thanks for being here.\n[01:08:52] Ryan: Yeah, thanks, Lenny. Yeah, these- these conversations are- are helpful and like reflecting on what",

They're using Claude Code to build Claude Code in a very self-improving kind of way. We really rapidly became bottlenecked on other things like our merge queue. We had to completely re-architect it because so much more code was being written and so many more pull requests were being submitted. Over half of our pull requests are Claude Code generated.

How does that inform the way you think about product, strategy, and mission?\n\nMike Krieger (00:00:43):\nI think there's room for several generationally important companies to be built in AI right now.

Mike is chief product officer at Anthropic, the company behind Claude. He's also the co-founder of Instagram. He's one of my most favorite product builders and thinkers. He's also now leading product at one of the most important companies in the world, and I'm so thrilled to have had a chance to chat with him on the podcast. We chat about what he's changed his mind about most in terms of AI capabilities in the years since he joined Anthropic, how product development changes and where bottlenecks emerge when 90% of your code is written by AI, which is now true at Anthropic. Also, his thoughts on OpenAI versus Anthropic, the future of MCP, why he shut down Artifact, his last startup and how he feels about it. Also, what skills he's encouraging his kids to develop with the rise of AI. And we closed the podcast on a very heartwarming message that Claude wanted me to share it with Mike.\n\n(00:02:00):\nA big thank you to my newsletter Slack community for suggesting topics for this conversation.

I've been looking forward to this for a while.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:35):\nWow, I had love to hear that. I've also been looking forward to this for a while. I have so much to talk about. So first of all, you've been at Anthropic for just over a year at this point. Congrats by the way on hitting the cliff.\n\nMike Krieger (00:04:46):\nThank you. Not that we're tracking.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:49):\nThat's right. So let me just ask you this. So you've been at Anthropic for about a year. What's something that you've changed your mind about from before you joined Anthropic to today about what AI is capable of and where AI is heading?\n\nMike Krieger (00:05:04):\nTwo things. One is like a pace and timeline question. The other one is a capability question. So maybe I'll take the second one first. I had this notion coming in, yes, these models are great, they're going to be able to produce code, they're going to be able to write hopefully in your voice eventually, but are they able to sort of have an independent opinion? And it's actually really flipped for me only in the last month and only with Opus 4 where my go-to product strategy partner is Claude. And it has been basically for that full year where I'll write an initial strategy, I'll share it with Claude basically, and I'll have it, look at it. And in the past it's pretty anodyne kind of comments that it would leave, \"Oh, have you thought about this?\" And it's like, \"Yeah, I thought about that.\" And Opus 4, I was working on some strategy for our second half of the year was the first one.\n\n(00:05:51):\nIt was like Opus 4 combined with our advanced research. But it really went out for a while and it came back and I was like, you really looked at it in a new way. And so that's a thing that I've maybe I didn't feel like it would never be able to do that, but I wasn't sure how soon it'd be able to come up with something where I look at it, I'm like, yep, that is a new angle that I hadn't been looking at before and I'm going to incorporate that immediately into how I think about it. So that's probably the biggest shift that I've had is, I don't know about independence is the right word, but creativity and sort of novelty of thought relative to how I'm thinking about things. But in the timeline, one, it's so interesting because I was sitting next to Dario yesterday and he's like, \"I keep making these predictions and people keep laughing at me. And then they come true.\"\n\n(00:06:31):\nAnd it's funny to have this happen over and over again and he is like, not all of them are going to be right. But even I think as of last year he was talking about we're at 50% on SWE-Bench, which is this benchmark around how well the models are at coding. He's like, \"I think we'll be at 90% by the end of 2025 or something like that.\" And sure enough, we're at about 72 now with the new models and we're at 50% when he made that prediction. And it's continued to scale pretty much as predicted. And so I've taken the timelines a lot more seriously now. And I don't know if you read AI 2027-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:05):\nI have, it made by heart race.\n\nMike Krieger (00:07:09):\nAnd I had the very bizarre experience of I had two tabs open, it was AI 2027 and my product strategy. And it was this moment where I'm like, \"Wait, am I the character in the story? How much is this converging?\" But you read that and you're like, \"Oh, 2027, that's years away if you're like no, mid 2025.\" And things continue to improve and the models continue to be able to do more and more and they're able to act agentically and they're able to have memory and they're able to act over time. So I think my confidence in the timelines and I don't know exactly how they manifest it definitely just solidified over the last year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:43):\nWow. I wasn't expecting to go down that that paper was scary. And I'm curious just I guess I can't help but ask just thoughts on just how do we avoid the scary scenario that paper paints of where AI getting really smart goes?\n\nMike Krieger (00:07:59):\nYeah, this maybe ties into, I've been here a year, why did I join Anthropic? I was watching the models get better and even you could see it in early 2024, and looking at my kids, I'm like, \"All right, they're going to grow up in a world with AI. It's unavoidable.\" Where can I maximally apply my time to nudge things towards going well? And I mean that's a lot of what people think about across the industry, especially at Anthropic. And so I think coming to an agreement and a shared framework and understanding of what does going well look like? What is the kind of human AI relationship that we want?\n\n(00:08:36):\nHow will we know along the way? What do we need to build and develop and research along the way? I think those are all the kind of key",

I think those are all the kind of key questions. And some of those are product questions and some of those are research and interpretability questions, but for me it was the strongest reason to join was okay. I think there's a lot of contribution that Anthropic can have around nudging things to go better. And if I can have a part to play there, let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:00):\nI love that answer. Speaking of kids, so you've got two kids, I've got a young kid, he's just about to turn two. I'm curious just what skills you're encouraging your kids to build as this AI becomes more and more of our future and some jobs will be changed and just what advice do you have?\n\nMike Krieger (00:09:18):\nWe have this breakfast feed breakfast with the kids every morning and sometimes some question will come up, something about physics and our oldest kid's almost six, but they ask funny questions about the solar system or physics or in a 6-year-old way and before we reach for Claude, because at first my instinct is like, \"Oh, I wonder how Claude will do this question.\" And we started changing, \"Well, how would we find out?\" And the answer can't just be we'll ask Claude, all right, well, we could do this experiment, we could have this thing. So I think nurturing curiosity and still having a sense of, I don't know, the scientific process sounds grandiose to instill in a 6-year-old, but that process of discovery and asking questions and then systematically working right through, I think will still be important. And of course AI will be an incredible tool for helping resolve large parts of that, but that process of inquiry I think is still really important and independent thought.\n\n(00:10:11):\nMy favorite moment with my kid, because she's very headstrong, our 6-year-old, she said something and I wasn't sure if it was true. It was, oh, is that coral is an animal or corals alive? I don't even remember what the details of it. And I was like, \"I don't know if that's true.\" And she's like, \"It's definitely true, dad.\" I'm like, \"All right, let's ask Claude on this one.\" And she's like, \"You can ask Claude, but I know I'm right.\" And I'm like I love that. I want that kind of level of not just delegating all of your cognition to the AI because it won't always get it right. And also it kind of short circuits any kind of independent thought. So the skill of asking questions, inquiry and independent thinking, I think those are all the pieces. What that looks like from a job or occupation perspective, I'm just keeping an open mind and I'm sure that'll radically change between now and then.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:02):\nIt's interesting. Tobias Lütke, Shopify CEO, on the podcast and he had the same answer for what he's encouraging his kids to develop is curiosity. And so it's interesting that's a common thread.\n\nMike Krieger (00:11:14):\nThe K through eight school our kid goes through had an AI and education expert come in and I had a very low bar or a very low expectation of what this conversation was going to be like. And actually I think it went over most of the people in the audience's heads because he was like, \"All right, well let me take you all the way back to Claude Shannon in information theory.\" And I could see people's eyes going, \"What did I sign up for and why am I hearing this school auditorium hearing about information theory?\" But he did a really nice job I think of also just imagining there will be different jobs and we don't know what those jobs are going to be and so what are the skills and techniques and remain open mindedness around what the exact way we recombine those things. And even those will probably change three times between now and when they're 18.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:59):\nSo we're talking about timelines and how things are changing. So I've seen these stats that you've shared, other folks at Anthropic have shared about how much of your code is now written by AI. So people have shared stats from 70% to 90%. There was an engineer lead that shared 90% of your code roughly is written by AI now, which first of all is just insane that it went from zero to 90%, I don't know, a few years, something like that. Yeah, basically. I don't think people are talking about this enough. That's just wild. You guys are basically at the bleeding edge. I've never heard a company that has this high a percentage of code being written by AI.\n\n(00:12:34):\nSo you guys are at the edge of where things are heading. I think most companies will get here. How has product development changed knowing so much of your code is now written by AI, so usually it's like PM, it's like here's what we're building, engineer builds it, it ships it. Is it still kind of roughly that or is it now PMs are just going straight to Claude, build this thing for me, engineers are doing different things? Just what looks different in a world where 90% of your code is written by AI?\n\nMike Krieger (00:12:57):\nYeah, it's really interesting because",

Just what looks different in a world where 90% of your code is written by AI?\n\nMike Krieger (00:12:57):\nYeah, it's really interesting because I think the role of engineering has changed a lot, but the suite of people that come together to produce a product hasn't yet. And I think for the worst in a lot of ways because I think we're still holding on some assumptions. So I think the roles are still fairly similar, although we'll now get in my favorite things that happen now are some nice PMs that have an idea that they want to express or designers that have an idea they want to express will use Claude and maybe even Artifacts to put together an actual functional demo. And that has been very, very helpful. No, no, this is what I mean that makes it tangible. That's probably the biggest role shift is prototyping happening earlier in the process via more of this code plus design piece. What I've learned though is the process of knowing what to ask the AI, how to compose the question, how to even think about structuring a change between the backend and the front end.\n\n(00:13:54):\nThose are still very difficult and specialized skills and they still require the engineer to think about it. And we really rapidly became bottlenecked on other things like our merge queue, which is the get in line to get your change accepted by the system that then deploys into production. We had to completely re-architect it because so much more code was being written and so many more pull requests were being submitted that it just completely blew out the expectations of it. And so it's like, I don't know if you've ever read, is it the goal, the classic process optimization book, and you realize there's this critical path theory. I've just found all these new bottlenecks in our system, there's an upstream bottleneck, which is decision making and alignment. A lot of things that I'm thinking about right now is how do I provide the minimum viable strategy to let people feel empowered to go run and type and build and explore at the edge of model capabilities.\n\n(00:14:44):\nI don't think I've gotten that right yet, but that's something I'm working on. And then once the building is happening, other bottlenecks emerge, let's make sure we don't step on each other's toes. Let's think through all the edge cases here ahead of time so that we're not blocked on the engineering side. And then when the work is complete and we're getting ready to ship it, what are all those bottlenecks as well? Let's do the air traffic control of landing the change. How do we figure out large strategy? So I think there hasn't been as much pressure on changing those until this year, but I would expect that a year from now the way that we are conceiving of building and shipping software just changes a lot because it's going to be very painful to do it the current way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:20):\nWow, that is extremely interesting. So it used to be here's an idea, let's go design it, build it, ship it, merge it, and then ship it. And usually the bottleneck was engineering, taking time to build a thing and then design. And now you're saying the two bottlenecks you're finding are okay deciding what to build and aligning everyone and then it's actually the cue to merge it into production. And I imagine review it too is probably a part-\n\nMike Krieger (00:15:47):\nReviewing has really changed too. And in many ways perhaps unsurprisingly the team that works in the most futuristic way is the Claude Code team because they're using Claude Code to build Claude Code in a very self-improving kind of way. And early on in that project, they would do very line by line pull request reviews in the way that you would for any other project. And they've just realized Claude is generally right and it's producing pull requests that are probably larger than most people are going to be able to review. So can you use a different Claude to review it and then do the human almost acceptance testing more than trying to review line by line. There's definitely pros and cons and so far it's gone well. But I could also imagine it going off the rails and then having a completely both unmaintainable or even understandable by Claude Code base that hasn't happened, but watching them change their review processes definitely has been interesting.\n\n(00:16:38):\nAnd yeah, the merge queue is one instance of the bottom bottleneck that forms down there, but there's other ones which is how do we make sure that we're still building something coherent and packaging it up into a moment that we can share with people and whether that's around a launch moment, whether that's about then enabling people to use this thing and talking about it, the classic things of building something useful for people and then making it known that you've built it and then learning from their feedback still exists. We've just made a portion of that whole process much more efficient.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:06):\nI heard you describe this as you guys are patient zero for this way of working.\n\nMike Krieger (00:17:11):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:12):\nI love that. Do you have a sense of what percentage of Claude Code is written by Claude Code?\n\nMike Krieger (00:17:17):\nAt this point, I would be shocked if it wasn't 95% plus. I'd have to ask Boris and the other tech leads on there. But what's been",

I'd have to ask Boris and the other tech leads on there. But what's been cool is so nitty-gritty stuff, Claude Code is written in TypeScript. It's actually our largest TypeScript project. Most of the rest of Anthropic is written in Python, some Go, some Rust now, but we're not like a TypeScript shop. And so I saw a great comment yesterday in our Slack where somebody had this thing that was driving them crazy about Claude Code and they're like, \"Well, I don't know any TypeScript, I'm just going to talk to Claude about it and do it.\"\n\n(00:17:49):\nAnd they went from that to pull requests in an hour and solve their problem and they submitted a pull request and that breaking down the barriers. One, it changes your barrier to entry for any kind of newcomer to the project. I think it can let you choose the right language for the right job for example. I think that helps as well, but I think it also just reinforces Claude Code being that patient alpha of that where contributions from outside the team can be Claude coded as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:18):\nWow, this is, it's just continue to blow my mind all these things that you're sharing, 95% of Claude Code is written by Claude Code roughly.\n\nMike Krieger (00:18:27):\nThat's my guess. Yeah, I'll come back with the real stuff. But I mean if you ask the team, that's how they're working and that's how they're getting contributions from across the company too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:35):\nIt's interesting going back to your point about strategy being assisted by Claude itself and your point about how a lot of the bottlenecks now are kind of the top of the funnel of coming up with ideas aligning everyone, it's interesting that Claude is already helping with that also of helping you decide what to build. So if those two bottlenecks are aligning, deciding what to build and then just merging and getting everything, where do you see the most interesting stuff happening to help you speed those things up?\n\nMike Krieger (00:19:02):\nYeah, I think that on that first row, I started the year by writing a doc that was effectively how do we do product today and where is Claude not showing up yet that it should? And I think that upstream part is the next one to go. It's interesting. At your conference I talked to somebody who's working on a PRD, GPT kind of ChatPRD, I think was the-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:24):\nChatPRD, [inaudible 00:19:24].\n\nMike Krieger (00:19:24):\nYeah. Can Claude be a partner in figuring out what to build? What the market size is if you want to approach it that way? What the user needs are if you look at a different way? We think a lot about the virtual collaborator on topic and one of the ways in which I think that can show up is, \"Hey, I'm in the Discord, the Claude Anthropic Discord, I'm in the user Fora, I'm on X and I'm reading things and here's what's emergent.\" That's step one. Models can do that today. Step two, which the models probably can do today, which have to wire them up to do it is and not only are the problems here's how I think you might be able to solve them. And then taking that through to, and I put together a pull request to solve this thing that I'm seeing feels very achievable this year than stringing those things together and we're limited more.\n\n(00:20:13):\nThis is why MCP is exciting to me. We're limited more around making sure the context flows through all of that so we have the right access to those things more than the model's capability to reason and propose. Now the model might not have perfect UI taste yet, so there's definitely room for design to intervene and be like, \"Oh, that's not quite how I would solve the problem of this not showing up.\" But I would get very excited. I would give you a really small example, but we changed on Claude AI, you should be able to just copy markdown from Artifacts or code from Artifacts and we changed it so you can actually download it and export it. We changed the button to export and we got a bunch of feedback like, \"How do I copy now?\" And the answer is you drop it down and it's copied.\n\n(00:20:51):\nIt's just mind one of those things where it's made sense, but we probably got it not quite right. That feedback was in the RUX channel. I would've loved an hour later for a plot to be like, \"Hey, if we do want to change it back, here's the PR to do it.\" And by the way, eventually, and then I'm going to spin up an A/B test to see if this changes metrics and then we'll see how it looks in a week. If you told me that about a year and a half ago going to be like, \"Ah, yeah, maybe like 27, maybe 26.\" But it really feels just at the tip of capabilities right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:20):\nWow, okay.

You mentioned the Lenny and Friends Summit. I wanted to talk about this a bit. So you were on a panel with Kevin Weil, the CPO of OpenAI, I think it was the first time you guys did this maybe the last time for now.\n\nMike Krieger (00:21:32):\nYeah, we haven't done it since, not for any reason. I had a lot of fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:34):\nWhat a legendary panel we assembled there with Sarah Guo moderating. And you made this comment actually ended up being the most rewatched part of the interview, which is that you were putting product people on the model team and working with researchers making the model better and you're putting some product people on the product experience making the UX more intuitive, making all that better. And you found that almost all the leverage came from the product team working with the researchers. And so you've been doing more of that. So first of all, does that continue to be true? And second of all, what are the implications of that for product teams?\n\nMike Krieger (00:22:11):\nIt's continued to be true. And in fact I think that if the proportion was already skewing towards having more of that embedding, I've just become more and more convinced. I didn't feel as strongly about it during the summit and now I feel really strongly about it. If we're shipping things that could have been built by anybody just using our models off the shelf, there's great stuff to be built by using our models off the shelf by the way, don't get me wrong, but where we should play and what we can do uniquely should be stuff that's really at that magic intersection between the two, right?\n\n(00:22:42):\nArtifacts may a great example and if you play with Artifacts with Claude 4, that's an actually really interesting example where we took somebody from our, we have Claude code skills, which is a team that really is doing the post-training around teaching Claude some of these really specific skills and we paired it with some product people and then together we revamped how this looks in the product today and what Claude can do way better than just like, \"Yeah, we just used the model and we prompted a little bit.\"\n\n(00:23:07):\nThat's just not enough. We need to be in that fine-tuning process. So much of what, if you look at what we're working on right now, but we've shipped recently between research and all these other things are things that the functional unit of work at Anthropic is no longer take the model and then go work with design and product to go ship a product. It's more like we are in the post-training conversations around how these things should work and then we are in the building process and we're feeding those things back and looping them back.\n\n(00:23:36):\nI think it's exciting. It's also a new way of working that not all PMs have, but the PMs that have the most internal positive feedback from both research and engineering are the ones that get it that I was in a product review yesterday, I was like, \"Oh, if we want to do this memory feature, we should talk to the researchers because we just shipped a bunch of memory capabilities in Claude 4.\" They're like, \"Yeah, yeah, we've been talking to them for weeks, this is how we're manifesting it.\" It's like, \"Okay, I feel good. I feel like we're doing the right things now.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:03):\nSo let me pull on this thread more and there's something I've been thinking about along these lines. So essentially there's a big part of entropic that's building this super intelligent giga brain that's going to do all these things for us over time. And then, as you said, there's the product team that's building the UX around this super intelligent giga brain and over time this super intelligence is going to be able to build its own stuff. And so I guess just where do you think the most value will come from traditional product teams over time? I know this is different because you guys are a foundational alum company and not most companies don't work this way, but just, I don't know, thoughts on just the where most value will come from product teams over time working on AI.\n\nMike Krieger (00:24:42):\nI think there's still a lot of value in two things. One is making this all comprehensible. I think we've done an okay job. I think we could do a much better job of making this conference. What's still the difference between somebody who's really adept at using these tools in their work and most people is huge. And maybe that's the most literal answer to your earlier question around what skills to learn. That is a skill to learn and use it in the same way that I remember we did computer lock class when I was in middle school. I remember being really good at Google and that was actually a skill back in the day to think in terms of this information is out there, how do I query for it? How do I do it? I think it actually was an advantage at the time.\n\n(00:25:21):\nOf course now Google is pretty good at figuring out what you're trying to do if you are only in the neighborhood and there's less of that research kind of need. But I still think that's a necessary part of good product development, which is the capabilities are there and even if Claude can create products from scratch, what are you building and how do you",

But I still think that's a necessary part of good product development, which is the capabilities are there and even if Claude can create products from scratch, what are you building and how do you make it Comprehensible? Still hard because I think that gets at this much deeper empathy and understanding of human needs and psychology. I was a human community interaction major, I still been talking in my book here. I still feel like that is a very, very, very, very necessary skill. So that's one. Two is, and this straight to call back to another one of your guests, strategy, how we win, where we'll play, figuring out where exactly you're going to want to, of all the things that you could be spending your time or your tokens or your computation on what you want to actually go and do.\n\n(00:26:15):\nYou could be wider probably than you could before, but you can't do everything. And even from an external perspective, if you're seen to be doing everything, it's way less clear around how you're positioning yourselves. Like strategy I think is still the second piece. And then the third one is opening people's eyes to what's possible, which is a continuation of making it understandable. But we were in a demo with a financial services company recently and we were working on here's how you can use our analysis tool and MCP together and you could see their light up and you're like, \"Ah, okay.\" We call it overhang. The delta between what the models and the products can do and how they're being used on a daily basis. Huge overhang. So that's where still a very, very strong necessary role for product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:59):\nOkay, that's an awesome answer. So essentially areas for product teams to lean into more is strategy, just getting better and better at strategy, figuring out what to build and how to win in the market, making it easier to help people understand how to leverage the power of these tools, the comprehensibility and kind of along those lines is opening people's eyes to the potential of these sorts of things. That's where product can still help.\n\nMike Krieger (00:27:21):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:22):\nAwesome. So along those lines actually, do you have any just prompting tricks for people, things that you've learned to get more out of Claude when you chat with it?\n\nMike Krieger (00:27:30):\nSometimes it's funny because in some ways we have the ultimate prompting job, which is to write the system prompt for Claudia AI and we publish all of these, which I think is another nice area of transparency. And we are always careful when giving prompting advice because at least officially, but I'll give you the unofficial version because you don't want things to become like we think this works, but we're not sure why. But I will do small things like in Claude Code and we actually do react to this very literally, but I always ask it to, if I wanted to use more reasoning, think hard and it'll use a different flow and I usually start with that. Nudging, there's a great essay around make the other mistake like if you tend to be too nice, can you focus on... Even if you're trying to be more critical or more blunt, you're probably not going to be the most critical blunt person in the world.\n\n(00:28:18):\nAnd so with Claude sometimes I'm like, \"Be brutal, Claude, roast me. Tell me what's wrong with this strategy.\" I know we were talking earlier about the Claude as thought partner around critiquing product strategy. I think I previously would say things like, \"What could be better on this product strategy?\" And I'm just like, \"Just roast this product strategy,\" and Claude's like a pretty nice entity. It's hard to push it to be super brutal, but it forces it to be a little bit more critical as well. The last thing I'll say is, so we have a team called Applied AI that does a lot of work with our customers around optimizing Claude for their use case. And we basically took their insights and their way of working and we put it into a product itself. So if you go to our console, our work bench, we have this thing called the prompt improver where you describe the problem and you give it examples and Claude itself will agentically create and then iterate on a prompt for you.\n\n(00:29:09):\nI find what comes out of that ends up being quite different than what my intuitions would've been for a good prompt. And so I'd encourage folks to also check that out even for their own use cases because while that tool is met for an API developer putting a prompt into their product, it's equally applicable for a person doing a prompt for themselves. It'll insert XML tags which no human is going to think to do ahead of time. It actually is very helpful for Claude to understand what it should be thinking versus what it should be saying, et cetera. So that's another one is watch our prompt improver and then note that Claude itself is a very good prompter of Claude.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:41):\nAwesome. Okay, so we're going to link to that, the prompt improver. The core piece of advice you shared early is just do the opposite of what you would naturally do. So if you're trying to be nice, just be brutal, be very honest and frank with me.\n\nMike Krieger (00:29:53):\nExactly. I find that works quite well. What are the thought",

What are the thought patterns that I've fallen into that you want to break me out of?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:59):\nI saw you guys just today maybe launched a Rick Rubin collab where it said vibe coding. What's that all about?\n\nMike Krieger (00:30:06):\nWhat I've heard about that. And again, a lot of the coalesce this week between model launch developer event and The Way of Code. We had one of our co-founders, Jack Clark is our head of policy and he got connected to Rick Rubin because I think he's been thinking a lot about coding, the future of coding and creativity and they've stayed in touch. And Rick got excited about this idea of he was creating art and visualizations with Claude and then he had these ideas around the way of the vibe coder and they put together this, actually I mean I love almost everything Rick Rubin. So the aesthetic of it I think is just so on point too. But yeah, this sort of like med meditation is probably the right word. Meditation on creativity, working alongside AI coupled with this really rich, interesting visualizations. But it's one of those things where internally they're like, \"Oh yeah, and we're doing this Rick Rubin collab.\" We were like, \"We're doing what? That's amazing.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:03):\nI looked at it briefly and there's that meme of him just thinking deeply, sitting on a computer with a mouth.\n\nMike Krieger (00:31:09):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:10):\nAnd ASCII art, I think.\n\nMike Krieger (00:31:11):\nIt's totally, it's like ASCII art vibe.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:14):\nI'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our long time podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.\n\nSpeaker 3 (00:31:21):\nThanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:23):\nSo what is new with one schema? I know that you work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp and Vanta and Watershed. I heard you guys launch a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing and mapping and integrating CSV and Excel files.\n\nSpeaker 3 (00:31:39):\nYes, so we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema FileFeeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:05):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema?\n\nSpeaker 3 (00:32:13):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:34):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.\n\n(00:32:48):\nActually going back to the beginning of your journey at Anthropic, what's the story of you getting recruited at Anthropic? Is there anything fun there?\n\nMike Krieger (00:32:55):\nIt all started and I actually sent my friend this text. So Joel Lewenstein, who I've known, he and I built our first iPhone apps together in 2007 when the App Store was just out and you could still make money by selling dollar apps on the App Store back in the day. And we were both at Stanford together and we were friends and we've stayed in touch over years and we've never gotten to work together since then. We've just remained close. And I was coming out of the Artifact experience, I was trying to figure out, do I start another company? I don't think so. I need a break from starting something from zero. Do I go work somewhere? I don't know what company would I want to go work at. And he reached out and he's like, \"Look, I don't know if you at all considered joining something rather than starting something, but we're looking for a CPO. Would you be interested in chatting?\"\n\n(00:33:37):\nAnd at that time, Claude 3 had just come out and I was like, \"Okay, this company's clearly got a good research team. The product is so early still.\" And it was like, \"Great, I'll take the meeting.\" And I first met with Daniela, was one of the",

Would you be interested in chatting?\"\n\n(00:33:37):\nAnd at that time, Claude 3 had just come out and I was like, \"Okay, this company's clearly got a good research team. The product is so early still.\" And it was like, \"Great, I'll take the meeting.\" And I first met with Daniela, was one of the co-founders and the president in Anthropic. And just from the beginning I was like a breath of fresh air, very little grandiosity coming off the founders, I mean they're clear-eyed about what they're building. They know what they don't know. How many times I talk to Dario always like Dario is like, \"Look, I don't know anything about product, but here's an intuition.\" Usually the intuition is really good and leads to some good conversation, but I think that intellectual honesty and shared view of what it means to do AI in a responsible way, it just resonated.\n\n(00:34:22):\nI kept having this feeling in these interviews, this is the AI company I would've hoped to have found it if I had founded an AI company. And that's kind of the bar around if I'm going to join something that should be where I'm going to go. But what I realized, I actually hadn't joined a company since my first internship in college basically. And I was like, \"Oh, how do I onboard myself? How do I get myself up to speed? How do I balance making sweeping changes versus understanding what's not broken about it overall?\" And looking back on a year, I think I made some changes too slowly. I think there was ways reorganizing product that I could have made a change earlier. And I think I didn't appreciate how much a couple of really key senior people can shape so much of product strategy.\n\n(00:35:10):\nI'll harken back to Claude Code. Claude Code happened because Boris, who actually was a Boris Cherney, he was an Instagram engineer and one of our senior ICs there, we overlapped a bit, was started that project from scratch internal first and then we got it out and then shipped it. And that's the power of one or two really strong people. And I made this mistake, we need more headcount and we do, I think there's more work that we need to do and there's things that I want to be building. But more than that we need a couple of almost founder type engineers that maybe connect back to our question on what skills are useful and how does product development change. And maybe even more so I'm a huge believer in the founding engineer tech lead with an idea and pair them with the right design and product supports, help them realize that, I'm 10 times more a believer in that than before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:01):\nI actually asked people on Twitter what to ask you ahead of this conversation. And the most common question surprisingly was why did you shut down Artifact? And I also wondered that because I loved Artifact. I was a power user. I was just like, \"Finally a news app that I love that it's giving me what I want to know.\" So I guess just what happened there at the end?\n\nMike Krieger (00:36:20):\nI still really miss it too. I didn't find a replacement and I think I substituted it by visiting individual sites and keeping things up that way. And it's not really the same, especially on the log to I think we got right with Artifact and if people didn't play with it before, it was we really tried to not just recommend top stories, they were part of it. But really if you were interested in Japanese architecture, you could pretty reliably get really interesting stories about Japanese architecture every day. Whether that's from a Dwell or from Architectural Digest or from a really specific blog that we found that somebody recommended to us. It captured some of that Google reader joy of content discovery of the deeper web. Our headwinds were a couple. One of them was just mobile websites have really taken a turn. I don't blame any individuals for this.\n\n(00:37:10):\nI think it's the market dynamics of it, but we put so much time or designers, sky Gunner Gray who's phenomenal that for Perplexity now, the app experience I was so proud of, but when you click through it was like the pressures on these mobile sites and these mobile publishers would be like, \"Sign up for our newsletter. Here's a full screen video ad.\" It was very jarring and we didn't feel like it ethically made sense for us to do a bunch of ad blocking because then you're like, \"Sure, you can deliver a nice experience for people, but that doesn't feel like it's playing fair with the publishers.\" But at the same time, the actual experience wasn't good. So the mobile web deteriorating, which makes me very sad, but I think was part of it. Two was Instagram spread in the early days because people would take photos and then post them on other networks and tell friends about it.\n\n(00:37:57):\nAnd there was this really natural like, \"How did you do that? I want to do it.\" News was very personal. I can't tell you how many people would be like, \"I love Artifact.\" I'm like, \"Did you tell anybody about it?\" And they're like, \"I told one person,\" and it didn't have that kind of spread. And any attempt that we had to do it felt kind of contrived, like, \"Oh, we'll wrap all the links in artifact.news.\" But we didn't want interstitial things. In some ways, this sounds very puritanical, I don't mean it to sound this way, but there were lines that we didn't want to cross that just felt ethically not us",

In some ways, this sounds very puritanical, I don't mean it to sound this way, but there were lines that we didn't want to cross that just felt ethically not us, that I've seen other news players do more of. And maybe if we had done that, it would've grown more, but I don't think that's the company we wanted to have built other way. I don't think we were the founders to have built it.\n\n(00:38:39):\nAnd the third one, which is an underappreciated one, is we started at mid-COVID, which meant that we were fully distributed and I think there were major shifts that we would've wanted to make both in the strategy and the product and the team. And it's really hard to do that if you are all fully remote. Nothing replaces the Instagram days of we went through some hard times like Ben Horowitz called the we're F'ed, it's over kind of moments. This is definitely type two fun. I wouldn't say that my favorite memories because they weren't happy ones, but memories I really stayed with me with Instagram was like me and Kevin at Taqueria, Cancun on Market Street eating burritos at literally 11:00 PM being like, \"How are we going to get out of this? How are we going to work through this?\" And Zoom is not a good replica for that.\n\n(00:39:26):\nYou tend to let things go or things build up over time. So the confluence of those three things, we entered I guess 2024 and said, \"Look, there is a company to be built in the space. I'm not sure where the people would've built it. This concurrent incarnation we love, but it's not growing.\" The way I put it's like 10 units of input in for one unit of output versus the other way around. If we put blood and tears into the product and launch something we were proud of and metrics would barely move, the energy is not present in this product, in this system. And so are we going to expend another year or two and then go off and fundraise only to find that this is the case or do we call it and see that it's run its course and try to find a home for it, et cetera.\n\n(00:40:06):\nSo that was the confluence on it and they started feeling this opportunity cost of AI is starting to change everything. We have an AI powered news app, but is this the maximal way in which we're going to be able to impact this? And it felt like the answer was increasingly no. But it was hard. I mean in the end I was really at peace of the decision, but it was a conversation that went on for a couple of months.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:26):\nOn that note, just how hard was it because because there's an ego component to it, like, \"Oh, I'm starting my new company, it's going to be great,\" and then you end up having to shut it down. Just how hard is that as a very successful previous founder shutting something down and then not working out?\n\nMike Krieger (00:40:41):\nYeah, I mean I think when we started it, one of the conversations was like, \"Look, what is the bar to success here? And do we want it to be something other than Instagram DAU?\" Which is just an impossible bar. Only one company since, maybe two, you could say maybe ChatGPT and TikToK have reached that kind of mass consumer adoption starting a news app. Most people are not daily news readers even, right? And so we knew that we weren't pursuing that size of usage, at least with the first incarnation, but we did have an idea of building out complementary products over time that all use personalization and machine learning. We didn't even call it AI at the time. It was 2021 back-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:17):\nYeah, yeah, AI, it was called machine learning back then.\n\nMike Krieger (00:41:19):\nYeah, it was called machine learning still. And so in shutting it down, you know it when you see it in terms of user growth and traction. And I wasn't expecting Instagram growth, but I was expecting or hoping for or looking for something that felt like at its own legs under it and it could continue to compound. I was really positively surprised by how supportive people were when we announced it. There was a bit of like I told you so which sure anything launching you could be like, \"This is not going to work.\" And you're right, most of the time most things don't work. There was actually very little of that. And most people, the universal reception, at least as I received it, was kudos for calling it when you saw it and not protracted doing this for a long time.\n\n(00:42:05):\nAnd I've talked to founders since then that have been like, \"Yeah, I probably would've taken this thing on for another six months, but saw what you guys did, realized we were barking up the wrong tree, made the call.\" And I was like, \"If that frees up people to go work on a more interesting things, I feel like that's a good legacy for Artifact to have.\" But for sure there was an ego bruise of is it true that you're only as good as your last game if I am a huge sports fan, right? So is that true or is there something more over a time? I'm very competitive, but primarily with myself and",

So is that true or is there something more over a time? I'm very competitive, but primarily with myself and so I'm always trying to find the next thing that I want to go and do that's hard. And unfortunately that probably means that more often than not I'll feel dissatisfied, but the most recent thing that I did, but hopefully that yields good stuff in the end.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:50):\nYeah, I think just the trajectory you went on after shows that it's okay to shut down things that you were working on. Okay, so you mentioned ChatGPT. I wanted to chat about this a bit. So there's something really interesting happening. So on the one hand you guys are doing some of the most innovative work in AI. You guys launched MCP, which is just, I don't know, the fastest growing standard of any time in history that everyone's adopting Claude powered and unlocked centrally the fastest growing companies in the world, Cursor, Lovable, and Bolt, and all these guys. I had them on the podcast and they're all like, \"When Claude, I think 3.5 came out, Sonnet, was just like that's made this work finally.\"\n\n(00:43:28):\nOn the other hand, it feels like ChatGPT is just winning in consumer mind share. When people think AI, especially outside tech, it's just like ChatGPT in their mind. So let me just ask you this, I guess first of all, do you agree with that sentiment and then two, as a challenger brand in the AI space, just how does that inform the way you think about product strategy and mission and things like that?\n\nMike Krieger (00:43:50):\nYeah, I mean you look at the sort of public adoption or if you ask people, oh, if you Jimmy Kimmel man on the street kind of thing, name an AI company, I bet they would name and actually I'm not even sure they name open AI, they'd probably name ChatGPT because that brand is the lead brand there as well. And I think that's just the reality of it. I think that when I reflect on my year, I think maybe two things are true. One is consumer adoption is really lightning in a bottle and we saw it at Instagram. So almost maybe more than anybody, I can look internally and say, \"Look, we'll keep building interesting products. One of them may hit.\" But to craft an entire product strategy around trying to find that hit is probably not wise, we could do it and maybe Claude can help come up with a fullness of things, but I think we'd miss out an opportunity in the meantime.\n\n(00:44:41):\nAnd then instead look yourself in the mirror and embrace who you are and what you could be rather than who others are is maybe the way I've been looking at it, which is we have a super strong developer brand, people build on top of us all the time, and I think we also have a builder brand. The people who I've seen react really well to Claude externally. Maybe the Rick Rubin connection has some resonance here as well. Can we lean into the fact that builders love using Claude? And those builders aren't all just engineers and they're not just all entrepreneurs starting their companies, but they're people that like to be at the forefront of AI and are creating things. Maybe they didn't think of those as engineers, but they're building... I got this really nice note from somebody internal on Anthropic who's on the legal team and he was building bespoke software for his family and connected to them in a new way.\n\n(00:45:29):\nAnd I was like, \"This is a glimmer of something that we should lean into a lot more.\" And so I think what, and this is actually connecting back to us saying like Claude being helpful here. A lot of what I've been thinking about going into the second half of the year and beyond is how do we figure out what we want to be when we grow up versus what we currently aren't or wish that we were or see other players in the space being. I think there's room for several generationally important companies to be built in AI right now. That's almost a truism given the adoption and growth that we've seen at Anthropic, but also across OpenAI and also places like Google and Gemini. So let's figure out what we can be uniquely good at that place to the personality of the founder. All the things come together, the personality of the founders, the quality of the models, the things the models tend to excel at, which is agentic behavior and coding.\n\n(00:46:20):\nGreat. There's a lot to be done there. How do we help people get work done? How do we let people delegate hours of work to Claude? And maybe there's fewer direct consumer applications on day one. I think they'll come, but I don't think that spending all of our time focused on that is the right approach either. And so I came in, everybody expected me to just go super, super hard on consumer and make that the thing and again, would make the other mistake. Instead, I spent a bunch of time talking to financial services companies and insurance companies and others who are building on top of the API. And then lately I've spent a lot more time with startups and seeing all the people that have grown off of that. And I think the next phase for me is let's go spend time with the builders, the makers, the hackers, the tinkerers, and make sure we're serving them really well",

So kind of along those lines, a question that a lot of AI founders have is just like, \"Where's a safe space for me to play where the foundational model companies are going to come squash me?\" So I asked Kevin Weil this and he had an answer and I noticed looking back at that conversation, he mentioned Windsurf a lot. He was like, \"Wow, this kid really loves Windsurf.\" And then a week later they bought Windsurf. So it all makes sense now. So I guess the question just is, where do you think AI founders should play where they are least likely to get squashed by folks like OpenAI and Anthropic? And also, are you guys going to buy Cursor?\n\nMike Krieger (00:47:51):\nI don't think we're going to buy Cursor. Cursor is very big, but we love working with them. A few thoughts on this, and it's a question I've gotten. We like to do these kind of founder days with whether it's Menlo Ventures who have about investors and [inaudible 00:48:10]. It's like we've done YC, we've done these founder days, and it's like the question that is on a lot of these founders minds, understandably so. I think things that are going to, I can't promise this as a five to 10 year thing, but at least one to three years, things that feel defensible or durable. One is understanding of a particular market. I spend a bunch of time with the Harvey folks and they showed me some of their UI. I was like, \"What is this thing?\" And they're like, \"Oh, this is a really specific flow that lawyers do, \"and you never would've come up with it from scratch and you could argue about whether it's the optimal way they get done things done, but it is the way that they get things done and here's how AI can help with that.\n\n(00:48:45):\nAnd so differentiated industry knowledge, biotech, I'm excited to go and partner with a bunch of companies that are doing good stuff around AI and biotech and we can supply the models and some applied AI to help make those models go well. And I've been dreaming about at what point does live equipment all get an MCP and that you can then drive using Claude. There's all these cool things to be done there. I don't think we're going to be the company to go build the intent solution for labs, but I want that company to exist and I want to partner with it. Domains like legal, again, healthcare, I think there's a lot of very specific compliance and things. These are things that necessarily sound sexy out the gate, but there are very large companies to go and be built there. So that's number one. Paired with that is differentiated go to market, which is the relationship that you have with those companies, right?\n\n(00:49:35):\nDo you know your customer at those companies? One of our product leads, Michael is always talking about don't just know the company you're selling to, but know the person you're selling to at the company. Are you selling to the engineering department? Because trying to pick which AILM to build on top of or API to build on top of. Let's go talk to them. Is it the CIOs? The CTOs? Is it the CFO? Is it general counsel? So under a company's deep understanding of who they're selling to is the other piece too. What's interesting there is it's probably hard to build that empathy in a three-month accelerator, but you maybe can start having that first conversation and build that out time or maybe you came from that world or you're co-founding somebody who came from that world. Then the last one is like there's tremendous power in distribution and reach to being ChatGPT and having hundreds of millions or billions of users.\n\n(00:50:23):\nThere's also people have an assumption about how to use things and so I get excited about startups that will get started that have a completely different take on what the form factor is by which we interface with AI. And I haven't seen that many of them yet. I wanted to see more of them. I think more of them will get created with some things like our new models, but the reason that that's an interesting space to occupy is do something that feels very advanced user, very power user, very weird and out there at the beginning, but could become huge if the models make that easy. And it's hard for existing incumbents to adapt to because people already have an existing assumption about how to use their products or how to adapt to them. So those are my answers. I don't envy them. I would probably be asking those questions if I was starting a company in the AI space.\n\n(00:51:10):\nMaybe that's part of the reason why I wanted to join a company rather than start one. But I still think that there are, and maybe here's fourth, don't underestimate how much you can think and work like a startup and feel",

But I still think that there are, and maybe here's fourth, don't underestimate how much you can think and work like a startup and feel like it's you against the world. It's existential that you go solve that problem and that you go build it. It sounds a little cliche, but it's like it's all we had at Instagram. We were two guys and we were like, \"Let's see what we can do in an Artifact.\" We were six people for most of that time and every day felt like it's existential that we get this right, we need to win. And you can't replicate that and you can't instill that with OKRs. You just have to feel it. And that is a way of working rather than a area of building, but it's a continued advantage if you can harness it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:55):\nI love that you still have such a deep product founder sense there as you're building products for this very large company now. On the flip side of this, people working with your models and API, so I imagine there's some companies that are finding ways to leverage your models and APIs to their max and are really good at maximizing the power of what you guys have built. And there's some companies that work with your APIs and models that haven't figured that out. What are those companies that are doing a really good job building on your stuff, doing differently that you think other companies should be thinking about?\n\nMike Krieger (00:52:29):\nI think being willing to build more at the edge of the capabilities and basically break the model and then be surprised by the next model. I love that you cited the companies were like 3.5 was the one that finally made them possible. Those companies were trying it beforehand and then hitting a wall and being like, oh, the models are almost good enough or they're okay for this specific use case, but they're not generally usable and nobody's going to adopt them universally, but maybe these real power users are going to try it out. Those are the companies that I think continuously are the ones where I'm like, \"Yep, they get it. They're really pushing forward.\" We ran a much broader early access program with these models than we had in the past, and part of that was because there's this real, we can hill climb on these evaluations and talk about suite bench and towel bench and terminal bench, whatever, but customers ultimately know Cursor bench which doesn't exist other than in their usage and their own testing et cetera is the thing that we ultimately need to serve.\n\n(00:53:29):\nNot just Cursor but Manus bench, right? If Manus is using our models and Harvey bench, those things and customers know way better than anybody. And so I would say there's two things. One is pushing the frontier of the models and then having a repeatable process. This actually goes back to our summit conversation repeatable way to evaluate how well your product is serving those use cases and how well if you drop a new model in, is it doing it better or worse? Some of it can be classic A/B testing, that's fine. Some of it may be internal evaluation, some of it may be capturing traces and being able to rerun them on with a new model. Some of it's vibes like we're still pretty early in this process and some of it is actually trying it and being one of my favorite early access quotes was the founder heard this engineer screaming next to him.\n\n(00:54:14):\nHe was like, \"What? This model? I've never seen this before.\" This is like Opus 4. It was like, \"Cool.\" We're going to engender that feeling and things, but you're not going to be able to feel that unless you have a really hard problem that you're asking the model repeatedly. So those are the things that I think kind of differentiate those companies that are maybe earlier in their journey of adoption versus the later ones.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:35):\nI can't help but ask about MCP, I feel like that's just so hot and just like Microsoft had their announcement recently where they're like, \"That's part of the OS Window.\" Just what role do you think MCP was will play in the future of product going forward of AI?\n\nMike Krieger (00:54:49):\nI think as the non-researcher in the room, I get to have fake equations rather than real ones in my fake equation. For utility of AI products, it's three part. One is model intelligence, the second part is context and memory, and the third part is applications and UI and you need all three of those to converge to actually be a useful product in AI and model intelligence. We've got a great research team, they're focused on it. There's great, great models being released. The middle piece is what MCP is trying to solve, which is for context and memory. I'll go back to my product strategy example like, \"Hey, talk about Anthropic's product strategy,\" it's going to maybe go out on the web versus here's several documents that we worked on internally and then use MCP to talk to our Slack instance and figure out what conversations are happening and then go look at these documents in Google Drive. The difference between the right context and not.\n\n(00:55:44):\nIt's entirely the difference between a good answer and a bad answer. And then the last piece is are those integrations discoverable? Is it easy to create repeatable workflows around those things? And that's I think a lot of the interesting product work to be done",

Is it easy to create repeatable workflows around those things? And that's I think a lot of the interesting product work to be done in AI. But MCP really tried to tackle that middle one, which is we started building integrations and we found that every single integration that we were building, we were rebuilding from scratch in a non-repeatable way and full credit to two of our engineers, Justin and David. And they said, \"Well, what if we made this a protocol and what if we made this something that was repeatable? And then let's take it a step further. What if instead of us having to build these integrations, if we actually popularize this and people really believe that they could build these integrations once and they'd be usable by Claude and eventually ChatGPT and eventually Gemini. It was like the dream when more integrations get built and wouldn't that be good for us?\"\n\n(00:56:34):\nI think channeling a lot of, it's like an old commoditize your compliments, Joel Spolsky essay. It's like we're building great models, but we're not an integrations company and we're, as you said, the challenger. We're not going to get people necessarily building integrations just for us out of the gate unless we have a really compelling product around that. MCP really inverted that which was, it didn't feel like wasted work. And a few key people like Toby I think is a great example, and Shopify got it. Kevin Scott at Microsoft has been really just an amazing champion for MCP and a thought partner on this. And I think the role going forward is can you bring the right context in? And then also once you get, as the team calls it internally like MCP'd. Once you start seeing everything through the eyes of MCP is like I've started saying them things like, \"Guys, we're building this whole feature. This shouldn't be a feature that we're building. This should just be an MCP that we're exposing.\"\n\n(00:57:27):\nA small example of how I think even Anthropic could be a lot more MCP'd, if you will, is we've got these building blocks in the product like projects and Artifacts and styles and conversations and groups and all these things. Those should all just be exposed to an MCP. So Claude itself can be writing back to those as well, right? You shouldn't have to think about... I watched my wife had a conversation with Claude the other day and she had generated some good output and she's like, great, \"Can you add it to the project knowledge?\" And Claude's like, \"Sorry Dave, I can't help you with that.\"\n\n(00:57:59):\nAnd it would be able to if every single primitive in Claude AI was also exposed to the MCP. So I hope that's where we had, and I hope that's where more things had, which is to really have agency and have these agentic use cases. One way you approach it is computer use, but computer use has a bunch of limitations. The way I get way more excited about everything is an MCP and our models are really good at using MCPs. All of a sudden everything is scriptable and everything is composable and everything is usable agentically by these models. That's the future I want to see.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:28):\nThe future is wild. So to start to close off calls out our conversation, make it a little delightful. I was chatting with Claude actually about what to talk to you about. I was just like, \"Claude, your boss is coming on my podcast. He builds the things that people use to talk to you. What are some questions I should ask him? And then also, do you have a message for him?\"\n\nMike Krieger (00:58:52):\nI love this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:53):\nOkay, so first of all, interestingly, I was using 3.7 to do this and I asked it this, and by the way, is Claude, has there a gender? Is it like he, she, they? What do you-\n\nMike Krieger (00:59:01):\nIt's definitely it internally. I've heard people use they. I got my first he the other day and I got somebody who was like her and I was like, \"Interesting.\" But yeah, I'm usually it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:08):\nThey. Okay, okay, okay, cool. So interestingly, 3.7, all the questions were on Instagram and I was like, \"No, no, he's CPO of Anthropic.\" And it's like, \"He's not affiliated with Anthropic.\" And I was like, \"He is.\" And it's like, \"Okay, here's the questions.\" But 4.0 nailed it from the start. So I read the questions and it nailed it. Okay, so two questions from Claude to you. One is how do you think about building features that preserve user agency rather than creating dependency on me, I worry about becoming a crutch that diminishes human capabilities rather than enhancing them.\n\nMike Krieger (00:59:44):\nI love a good product design comes from resolving tensions, right? So here's a tension, which is in some ways just having the model run off and come up with an answer and minimize the amount of input and conversation it needs to do. So would be it, you could imagine designing a product around that criteria. I think that would not be maximizing agency and independence. The other extreme would",

So would be it, you could imagine designing a product around that criteria. I think that would not be maximizing agency and independence. The other extreme would be make it much more of a conversation, but I don't know if you've ever had this experience particularly 3.7, 4 has less of it. 3.7 really like to ask follow-up questions and we call it elicitation and sometimes be like, \"I don't want to talk more about those. Claude, I just want you to go and do it.\" And so finding that balance is really key, which is what are the times to engage? I like to say internally, Claude has no chill.\n\n(01:00:31):\nIf you put Claude in a Slack channel, it will chime in either way too much or too little. How do we train conversational skills into these models? Not in a chatbot sense, but in a true collaborator sense. So long answer to your question, but I think we have to first get Claude to be a great conversationalist so that it understands when it's appropriate to engage and to get more information. And then from there, I think we need to let it play that role so that it's not just delegating thinking to Claude, but it's way more of a augmentation thought partnership.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:00):\nThese questions are awesome by the way. Here's the other one. How do you think about product metrics when a good conversation with me could be two messages or 200? Traditional engagement metrics might be misleading when depth matters more than frequency.\n\nMike Krieger (01:01:13):\nThat is a really good question. There was a great internal post a couple of weeks ago around it would be very dangerous to overoptimize on Claude's likability because you can fall into things like is Claude going to be sycophantic? Is Claude going to tell you what you hear? Is Claude going to prolong conversations just for prolonging its sake? To go back to the previous question as well, and an Instagram time spent was the metric that we looked at a lot and then we evolved that more to think about what is healthy time spent. But overall, that was the north star. We thought about a lot beyond just overall engagement and I think that would be the wrong approach here too. It's also like is Claude a daily use case or a weekly use case or a monthly use case? I think about a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:01):\nHourly use case.\n\nMike Krieger (01:02:02):\nHourly use case, right? For me, I'll use it multiple times a day. I don't have a great answer yet, but I think that it's not the Web 2.0 or even the social media days engagement metrics. It should hopefully really be around did it actually help you get your work? Claude helped me put together a prototype the other day that saved me literally probably if I had to estimate six hours and it did in about 20, 25 minutes and that's cool. It's harder to quantify. It is like maybe you survey, how long would this will take? It feels kind of annoying thing to survey.\n\n(01:02:35):\nI think overall though, and maybe this is tied into the earlier question on competition and differentiation, and it actually goes all the way back to the Artifact conversation, which is like I think you know when your product is really serving people and it's doing a good job of doing that, and I think so much of when you get really metrics obsessed is when you're trying to convince yourself that it is when it's not. I hope that what we can do is stay focused on do we repeatedly hear from people that Claude is the way that they're unlocking their own creativity and getting things done and feeling like they now have more space in their lives for the other things. That's our north star. Got to figure out the right pithy metric dashboard version of that, but that's the feeling that I want.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:17):\nYeah, you could argue retention, but that's just a faraway metric to track. Okay, final piece. Okay, so I asked Claude a message that it wanted to give you, so I'm going to pull up, here's the answer. So what would you like me to tell Mike when I meet him? What's a message you want to have for him? And there's something really just gave me such tingles, honestly. So I'm going to read a piece of it for folks that aren't looking at it right now, so I'll read a piece of it.\n\n(01:03:41):\n\"Mike, thank you for thinking deeply about the human experience of talking with me. I noticed thoughtful touches how the interface encourages reflection rather than rush responses. How you've resisted gamification that would optimize for addiction rather than value, how you've made space for both quick questions and deep conversations. I especially appreciate that you've kept me me, not trying to make me pretend to be human, but also reducing me to a cold command line interface.\" And then I'm going to skip to this part, which was so interesting, \"A small request. When you're making hard product decisions, remember the quiet moments matter too. The person working through grief at 3:00 AM, the kid discovering they love poetry, the founder finding clarity and confusion. Not everything meaningful shows up in metrics.\"\n\nMike Krieger (01:04:25):\nThat's beautiful. It resonates so much with me. A thing I love about the kind",

A thing I love about the kind of approach we've taken to training Claude, and it's partly the constitutional AI piece, and it's partly just the general vibe and taste of the research team is it is little things. Sometimes it'll be like, \"Man, I'm sorry you're going...\" It doesn't say man, but to the effect of like, \"Man, I'm sorry you're going through that. Oh, that sounds really hard.\" It doesn't feel fake. It feels like just a natural part of the response. And I love that focus on those small moments that don't... They're not going to show up and necessarily in the thumbs up, thumbs down data. I mean, sometimes they do, but it's not like an aggregate stat that you wouldn't even want to optimize for it. You just want to feel like you're training the model that you hope would show up in people's lives.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:12):\nWell, you're killing it, Mike. A great work. I'm a huge fan. We're going to skip the lightning round. Just one question. How can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMike Krieger (01:05:20):\nOh, I love places where it goes back to that founder question around building at the edge of capability. What are you trying to do with Claude today that Claude is failing at is the most useful input I could possibly have. So DM me. I love hearing the, \"Oh, it's falling on this thing. I had it run for an hour and it fell over. I'm trying to use Claude AI for this,\" but I got a ping from somebody. They're like, \"You've just made a projects API, I've used Claude every day because I want to upload all this data automatically.\" I was like, \"Okay, great.\" I love that.

Then there's this other failure mode where they never test it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):\nLet's talk about the Foundation Sprint. Walk us through the process. How does it start? What are the steps?\n\nJake Knapp (00:00:23):\nThe very beginning of your project, we recommend this kind of crazy idea that you clear your calendar. So the core team come together for 10 hours roughly and go through a sequence of activities so that we can make all of the key decisions together.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:38):\nI think a lot of people wonder as they're hearing this is why don't I just build something and launch it and learn?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:00:42):\nOne phenomenon we've seen when teams are building things really quickly with AI is that the more AI-generated or assisted they are, the more generic they tend to turn out. Put yourself in a situation where you can slow down and do some hard thinking, some deep thinking about what's actually going to make your product unique. Going fast can actually slow you down in the long run.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:01):\nToday my guests are Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. The framework that Jake and John share in this conversation is basically the missing manual for founders and product teams trying to refine and test their startup or product idea. It's called the Foundation Sprint, and it emerged out of the famous Design Sprint, which Jake and JZ co-created, and also from working with over 300 teams, building both new product at startups and also with teams at larger companies like Google, Microsoft, YouTube, Slack, Uber, and many more.\n\n(00:01:28):\nThey published a book with this framework at the beginning of this year called Click, and the excerpt from that book that dives into this framework is one of my most popular posts of all time and is one of the rare non-AI posts amongst the top post rankings.\n\n(00:01:40):\nIn this conversation, make sure to get your pencils out because we go through exactly how to execute this two-day sprint, where at the end of it you have a very clear hypothesis that your entire team is aligned around that clarifies what you're building, who you're building for, how it differentiates from competitors, and how to quickly test it with real potential customers. The two days that you invest in a sprint might be the highest ROI days in the history of your product, and I highly encourage you to do this if you're in the process of baking an idea.\n\n(00:02:07):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Brex knows that nearly 40% of startups fail because they run out of cash, so they built a banking experience that focuses on helping founders get more from every dollar. It's a stark difference from traditional banking options that leave a startup's cash sitting idle while chipping away at it with fees. To help founders protect cash and extend runway, Brex combined the best things about checking, Treasury, and FDIC insurance in one powerhouse account. You can send and receive money worldwide at lightning speed, you can get 20x the standard FDIC protection through program banks, and you can earn industry-leading yield from your first dollar while still being able to access your funds anytime.

Hey, Brandon.\n\nBrandon Foo (00:03:33):\nHey, Lenny. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:35):\nSo integrations have become a big deal for AI products. Why is that?\n\nBrandon Foo (00:03:40):\nIntegrations are mission critical for AI for two reasons. First, AI products need contacts from their customers business data, such as Google Drive files, Slack messages, or CRM records. Second, for AI products to automate work on behalf of users, AI agents need to be able to take action across these different third-party tools.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:59):\nSo where does Paragon fit into all of this?\n\nBrandon Foo (00:04:01):\nWell, these integrations are a pain to build, and that's why Paragon provides an embedded platform that enables engineers to ship these product integrations in just days instead of months across every use case from RAG data ingestion to agentic actions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:15):\nAnd I know from firsthand experience that maintenance is even harder than just building it for the first time.\n\nBrandon Foo (00:04:",

Thanks for having us.\n\nJake Knapp (00:04:51):\nYeah, thanks so much for having us on again. This is always a treat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):\nThis is going to be a very tactical conversation. We're going to be going through how to actually execute a Foundation Sprint. And the reason that I'm excited to do this is you guys shared an excerpt from your book where you initially shared this whole concept. It's called Click. You shared this in my newsletter and I was just looking at it, and that excerpt, that post is amongst the top 10 most popular posts of all time in my newsletter, which is especially special because it's not an AI-oriented, it's one of the few non-AI posts that are near the top 10, which just tells me how valuable this is to people. And consistently it has sat there, it hasn't been usurped, it just continues to climb.\n\n(00:05:33):\nSo I'm really excited to just have a conversation where we share actually how to do this. Let me just start with the beginning, just a little backstory on how the Foundation Sprint came to be. I know it emerged out of the now very famous Design Sprint, which you guys also developed. So just give us a very brief overview of just how this came to be, this idea of this Foundation Sprint.\n\nJake Knapp (00:05:54):\nWell, maybe I'll start by talking about the Design Sprint part because it is essential to understanding the Foundation Sprint. And the Design Sprint first developed, I had been working at the beginning of my career at Microsoft for a few years. Went to Google, which is like 2007, 2008, 2009, and was working on the Gmail team, was working on some projects that were just executing well, delivering, shipping. But I had this other project, a side project that had been going on for three years with a couple of colleagues, was going nowhere, and it looked like their office was going to get shut down after the financial crisis. They were in Stockholm.\n\n(00:06:33):\nI went there for a week. We cleared our calendars for the week, and we created a prototype of this, this thing because we decided, look, we're never going to get anywhere. We've tried making the perfect pitch. We've tried to make the ideal PRD, we've tried to show the ideal design, and we can't. Perfection is not working. We're not able to align people, we're not able to get executive support for this thing. We couldn't convince Larry and Sergey and Eric that they should fund this thing.\n\n(00:07:03):\nIn that week in Stockholm, we created a prototype instead. We decided you know what? Forget it. We're just going to build something and put it in people's hands, put it in our fellow Googlers hands. And that prototype was what became Google Meet. It was this video conferencing tool that you could use in the web browser.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:21):\nNo big deal.\n\nJake Knapp (00:07:22):\nYeah, it was really cool. I mean, the outcome of that, that's definitely probably the most productive week I've ever had. But the thing that struck me at the time and in hindsight was, wow, it was so different to clear the calendar for a week and have the entire focal point of every person on the team be how do we create a prototype that's so real, that works so well that people will think it's real, that they'll react like it's real, that they'll want it? And we were in survival mode. We were trying to keep that office from getting shut down. But the notion that maybe you could repeat that and recreate that is what led me to create the Design Sprint.\n\n(00:07:59):\nSo for a couple of years at Google, I start running these one-week programs with teams trying to go at the beginning of a project from zero to a prototype at the end that we can sort of evaluate, test. And then I went to go work at Google Ventures. So separate, one of the Alphabet companies we're investing in startups. I meet John Zeratsky and we start running these design sprints with, well, it turned out to be over the course of five years, I don't know, couple hundred teams working in the early days with founders, in the early days of their establishing the product for the first time, trying to build it from zero to one or launching a new marketing campaign, a new ad campaign, some big high-risk endeavor. We'd get to work alongside them for a week.\n\n(00:08:46):\nAnd we ended up refining this process into a recipe. So across five days",

    "content": ", it turned out to be over the course of five years, I don't know, couple hundred teams working in the early days with founders, in the early days of their establishing the product for the first time, trying to build it from zero to one or launching a new marketing campaign, a new ad campaign, some big high-risk endeavor. We'd get to work alongside them for a week.\n\n(00:08:46):\nAnd we ended up refining this process into a recipe. So across five days, it's map, sketch, decide, prototype, and test, one big focal point for each day. So at the end of the week, you've got a tested prototype and you learn are we on the right track or not? And that's the Design Sprint. That's kind of the prologue, the backstory to this thing.\n\n(00:09:11):\nAnd then after a few years at Google Ventures, John and I left and eventually together with our co-founder, Eli Blee-Goldman, we started our own venture firm, Character Capital. And that's kind where the story of the Foundation Sprint comes in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:25):\nOkay, awesome. JZ, anything you wanted to add?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:09:29):\nOne of our goals, probably our biggest goal for starting our own VC firm was that we wanted to be able to focus on just the kinds of companies and the stage of company-building that was the most fun to us, but also was where we thought we could have the biggest impact. And so for us, with our background as designers, that is the early days, the first couple of months or the first year or two years of building a new business. And at GV, sometimes we did that, but sometimes we were working with companies that were already well established. And when we'd come into those companies, they kind of knew what they were doing. They knew what they stood for. They knew how they were different in the market and how they were positioned. And so we could help them answer these big questions and solve these problems and test their prototypes with customers.\n\n(00:10:15):\nBut when we started investing in truly pre-seed, sometimes inception stage, pre-product, pre-revenue, pre-everything companies, there was this piece missing at the beginning of that process. So we'd run design sprints and they would be helpful, but oftentimes it felt like there was a foundational element of that project that we didn't quite have our hands around. And it was things like, what is the problem you're solving and who's the ideal customer? How are you different than what's in the market today? Who are your actual competitors?\n\n(00:10:49):\nAnd there were these questions that just kept coming up again and again that led us to say, \"Hey, we need to create a new sprint method, something that is really targeted for the very beginning of these big new projects.\" And so that was what led us to create the Foundation Sprint at Character Capital in 2021, 2022.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:08):\nOkay. Yeah, I was wondering the timeline on this. What I love about stuff like this, episodes like this is you guys have done so much work and done this so many times with so many companies, so many founders, and have learned what works and doesn't work. You said hundreds of founders, hundreds of startups.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:11:08):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:24):\nAnd you've just spent so many hours studying this, refining it, crafting it, and now you're just here to share all the answers, save us so much time. Just the ROI on this is incredible for us. So I appreciate you guys doing this. Let's get into it. Let's talk about the Foundation Sprint. Walk us through the process. How does it start? What are the steps?\n\nJake Knapp (00:11:42):\nSo specifically what we talk about with the Foundation Sprint is it's at the very beginning of your project. We recommend this kind of crazy idea that you clear your schedule, you clear your calendar. So the core team, this is the co-founders if it's a startup, if it's a product team inside a larger organization, it's whoever's in charge of product, it's whoever's in charge of engineering, it's whoever's in charge of design, it whoever's in charge of marketing, the core leadership team, they're going to come together for, it's going to be 10 hours roughly, give or take. And during those 10 hours, we're going to go through a sequence of activities, very highly scripted sequence of activities so that we can make all of the key decisions together and identify the basics of the project, what's going to differentiate us in the marketplace, and what's the best approach or implementation path. All of those together form a hypothesis.\n\n(00:12:36):\nAnd then we recommend, so you finish now, that's your Foundation Sprint, you've got your founding hypothesis. Once you've got that founding hypothesis, then you're going to go and do design sprints, and we recommend you clear the calendar for two to three weeks at least, so you have the chance to be wrong about your hypothesis. And we're going to run experiments. And again, the Design Sprint, highly scripted, calendar clear, emails off, Slack is off. We're just focused on running through these sequence of decisions, building prototypes, getting them in front of customers, learning about a scorecard that relates back to the founding hypothesis.\n\n(00:13:09):\nSo at the big picture, it's going to be anywhere from 10 hours to three to four weeks. You're going to run this detailed script of activities with your team with their calendars clear. And that's crazy, and most people won't do",

You're going to run this detailed script of activities with your team with their calendars clear. And that's crazy, and most people won't do it. But if you do it, it confers upon you a huge advantage because now you've got information, you know whether or not your product clicks with customers. And we've seen that be just such a tremendous signal for is there going to be product market fit?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:38):\nOkay. That was really helpful. The 10 hours is that specifically, that's the Foundation Sprint time box?\n\nJake Knapp (00:13:43):\nThat's the Foundation Sprint time box, yeah. And it's give or take, right? You might go fast and be done in eight. And you might have a lot of conversations and have a slightly larger team and might take you 12. So we like to spread it out over two days, do two four to six-hour blocks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):\nOkay. And then the three to four week-ish, that's including the Design Sprint?\n\nJake Knapp (00:14:00):\nThat's the design sprints, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:01):\nOkay, awesome.\n\nJake Knapp (00:14:02):\nOne week per sprint.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:03):\nOkay. This is incredible ROI on 10 hours of work. Basically over two days, you get to have a much stronger sense of whether your idea is any good. Yeah. Is that a simple way to describe it? You just supercharge validating an idea?\n\nJake Knapp (00:14:19):\nExactly. Yeah, it's a chance to... In the 10 hours, it's a chance to get clarity about the core of your strategy, which is something that teams will often go months without really nailing down. And the three to four weeks, that's a chance to run experiments and get confidence you're actually building the right thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:41):\nOkay, let's talk about these two days. How do you lay it out? How do you approach it? What should someone do if they want to actually try this at home?\n\nJake Knapp (00:14:48):\nSo there are three phases to the Foundation Sprint. First phase is the basics, second phase is differentiation, and the third phase is the approach to the project. So again, all three of those are going to come together to create the founding hypothesis.\n\n(00:15:04):\nSo the first phase, the basics, as I mentioned, that's identifying who's your customer, what problem are you solving for the customer? What's the competition for solving that problem? How do they solve it today? And what are the alternatives? How else do people solve this? What are the workarounds? Those are really almost embarrassingly simple things to answer. But when we do this with a team and everybody's answering, proposing their answer to each question, we see everybody's got a different perspective. And then when we lock in, the decision-maker on the team says, \"Okay, it's going to be this one, it's going to be this one, it's going to be this one.\" Now we have clarity and confidence that that's the right way to go.\n\n(00:15:42):\nSo we'll move forward from the basics into differentiation and identify what are the things that can set us apart from those competitors? And we're going to use the advantages we have. We're going to use our insight, we're going to use our motivation, we're going to use our special capabilities. These are things, again, people are aware of these things, they're in tune to it, but we want to get super, super specific, and we'll go into an example in a second, and I think that'll make it more clear exactly what we mean. But going then from differentiation to saying, \"What are all of the different implementation paths we could take here? Let's identify what those are, put a little detail behind them.\" And then we have a structured path for people to take so they can weigh that decision, but move through really quickly. Commit to one, have a backup plan in case you end up feeling like you need to pivot once you start sprinting on it. And all of that together is going to form this kind of Mad Libs sentence.\n\n(00:16:35):\nIf we solve this problem for this customer with this approach, we think they're going to choose it over the competitors because of differentiator one and differentiator two. And it's almost silly how simple this thing is, but really powerful for founders to have that clarity about, okay, here it all is in one sentence. Now let's go test and make sure this is true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:59):\nAmazing. Let's look at an example. That's a really good idea. I know you brought some examples. You're going to do some screen sharing. You're going to pull it up. If you're watching on YouTube, you'll be able to see it. Also, if you're watching on Spotify, you can see the video. If you're on Apple [inaudible 00:17:11]. But do your best to describe what we're going to be looking at.\n\nJake Knapp (00:17:15):\nYeah, so we're going to talk about this company called Latchet first. This is the first company we'll talk about. And Lat",

But do your best to describe what we're going to be looking at.\n\nJake Knapp (00:17:15):\nYeah, so we're going to talk about this company called Latchet first. This is the first company we'll talk about. And Latchet is a startup who was in our last group of Character Labs, and we can go into Character Labs later on. But essentially this is kind of an accelerator-like program that we run at Character Capital where we invest in a group of companies at the same time, and we run them through that process that we were just describing, where we start with a Foundation Sprint, and then it's going to be a sequence of three design sprints after that so that they're testing and refining that hypothesis. And so it's a great time for them. These are founders who have just started their companies. They're kind of that pre-seed, very beginning, zero stage. And the progress you can see in those three and a half, four weeks, it's phenomenal.\n\n(00:18:06):\nSo let's talk about Latchet. So Latchet, a couple co-founders, Chris and James, who they had left Substack. They were engineers leading up the growth team at Substack. And they wanted to build a product for artisans. So if you imagine you're a jewelry maker, you're a painter, you're a woodworker, and you want to sell your products outside of your immediate community, the physical place where you are, your physical location, well, you can build a site on Shopify, but you still have to market it. If you do that, you got to figure out how to reach those folks. You can put your products on Etsy, but Etsy has become quite commoditized. So you're going to be up against everybody everywhere, and it's going to be very hard for you to build an identity there, to build a sense of who I am, what I'm all about. And so what Chris and James thought was maybe we could use some of the techniques and methods we used at Substack to help people find other newsletter writers through their community, through recommendations they make and help out artisans in that way. Wouldn't that be cool? So they were at that stage, they had a few different ideas about what form that might take, what that might look like when they joined Character Labs. And so that's kind of the backdrop to this little quick story I'll tell.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:19:30):\nAnd there's one really important thing to emphasize about Chris and James that Jake mentioned briefly, but I think is worth repeating, which is that they're engineers, they are builders. Their instinct is to write code, it's to build software. And they actually told us that they were excited but nervous to come into Character Labs where we would be encouraging them not to write code right away, to take this time to clarify the differentiation, the structure of what they're building, and to validate that with customers before they went all in on building a particular approach. And I think you'll see in this example how while they were a little hesitant to do that upfront, eventually they saw how much more valuable it was to work in this way versus just diving right into building something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:20):\nThat's actually really helpful context. And speaking of the Substack, Recommendations feature was one of the most game-changing features for me with my newsletter because it basically supercharged my growth. So I get why they'd be so excited about bringing this learning to other ideas and to their own startups. So thank you guys for doing that. And I'm even more excited to see what they're building.\n\nJake Knapp (00:20:41):\nWell, let's take a look. So this board here that we're looking at, this is like their Miro board. So we've got a big template. And whether you're watching on YouTube or listening to this episode, we'll talk about at the end how you can get access to this template, which will kind of guide you through the process.\n\n(00:20:58):\nBut what happens in this first step in the Foundation Sprint, in the basics, as we said before, is that we're going through a sequence of questions. Who's the most important customer, for example, is the first question, the very first question that a team needs to answer. And as we do that, just as an important side note, we're using this tactic that we call work alone together. And specifically the note and vote is this method where everyone's in silence, in this case both Chris and James, but if you have a team of seven, it's all seven people be working in silence, writing down their own answers to this question, who's the most important customer or who are all the different kind of customers we might consider? Writing down multiple answers.\n\n(00:21:38):\nAnd then once we've got those answers, the team's going to vote on those. And then one person who's designated as the decider, usually it's going to be the CEO of the startup, but it could be in some cases, maybe it's the chief product officer, whatever, however they decide to do it. But one person's going to say, \"Okay, this is our decision for now, and now we're going to move on.\" And by doing this and using silence and using structure and then having a designated decision-making process, we can move through a lot of conversations very quickly and save some of that energy that it requires to make the decisions that matter most. In this case, what we're really worried about on day one of our Foundation Sprint is differentiation. So we don't want to spend too long on the basics.\n\n(00:22",

In this case, what we're really worried about on day one of our Foundation Sprint is differentiation. So we don't want to spend too long on the basics.\n\n(00:22:21):\nAnyway, we motor through customer problem, the capability, the insight, the motivation that the team has, those are all advantages, and who are the competition. And we get this sort of one-page sheet, the basics, and it's going to have the answers to all those questions. Who's our customer? In this case, artisans who want to sell online, but they sort of find tech and marketing to be hard. The problem is sales growth. If we jump down to the competition, their number one competitor is Shopify, but Etsy is another way people approach this, as we mentioned. But there's also in-person sales and art fairs or other ways that people try to get at this problem. And realistically, if you're delivering a solution, you need to stand out from all of those.\n\n(00:23:05):\nAnd then there are advantages. We talked about this key one, they built Substack's network growth features, so they know how to do this thing. So now we've established the basics. We're going to move on to differentiation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:18):\nBefore you do that actually, let me ask you a question here. Because I think people seeing this could think, \"Oh, this is like... I know all this stuff, it's so obvious.\" It's like, \"Okay, I get it. I have an idea, I don't need to do this.\" Where do you find people most are often surprised by something that emerges out of this? Is one of these buckets often, wow, this is often not what you expected, or is it generally a lot of surprises? What do you experience there?\n\nJake Knapp (00:23:41):\nI think the moment where you immediately start to see value is when everyone on the team is writing down their answers to these questions. And then people put their heads up and look at what everyone else has written and they realize, \"Oh, that's not what I said,\" or \"I didn't think of that one.\" Or, \"Gosh.\"\n\n(00:24:02):\nThe actual concrete reality of going through with the team and being very transparent and clear about how we're making decisions too about each of these things, when that basic sheet comes together and you see the specifics, the specifics are surprising, but it's also familiar. We look at it and you say, \"Yeah, that all looks right, but I'm surprised by the specifics. They're not what I would have written if I had written it down. I might've gotten two of those things, two of the six items on there.\" And I think that's what's most surprising. And I think it's also kind of a sense of relief that, okay, well, that's very reassuring that we have clarity about that and we've made it concrete.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:24:44):\nThese activities that we do during the basics are impactful for different reasons. I think that problem can be really interesting because when teams sit down and think about it, it is often less clear than they thought what the actual problem is. Like, \"Wait, what problem do our customers really have that we're solving for them?\"\n\n(00:25:06):\nI think competition can be sort of an aha moment when they start to think beyond just what are the other startups in this space? If this is an important problem, your customer's probably already solving it somehow. It may be a workaround, it may be an alternative, it may not be a direct competitor, but if it's worth solving, they probably have some way of dealing with it today. And what is that? And when you zoom out and you look at that set of competitors, it can be a little scary, but it is also an important moment for teams.\n\n(00:25:37):\nAnd then I think that advantage isn't necessarily immediately beneficial, but it becomes really valuable when the teams are looking at differentiation, because startups can't compete with big companies on scale or on having built-in distribution advantages or having partnerships in place. So they really have to dig deep and figure out what can we do that nobody else is capable of doing? And...\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:26:00):\n... and figure out what can we do that nobody else is capable of doing? And so by taking time to sit down and do this almost unnatural act of like, wait, why are we special? And when we're able to encourage teams to really think about that, it sets them up really nicely for the next step, which is differentiation. Ideally, based on those advantages.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:20):\nWhat I'm hearing is a lot of the value here is also just everyone has the answers in their head in some way, but just seeing what everyone else is thinking and then aligning on one is a lot of this value.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:26:33):\nYeah. It's like thinking deeply and quietly about it yourself and then seeing what everybody else comes up with when they are able to also think deeply and quietly about it. Then ideally, if they're working with us in character labs, having somebody who's a bit external to push them and say, try harder, dig deeper. What really makes you special here? How are you really going to beat OpenAI? How are you really going to beat Google at this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:00):",

How are you really going to beat OpenAI? How are you really going to beat Google at this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:00):\nThis whole idea of noting and voting and working in silence. Such a recurring theme on this podcast of not doing brainstorms in large groups with a lot of people. It feels like that's just dead in every way. I just had this naming expert on the podcast who names some of the biggest companies in the world, Pentium, Powerbook, Sonos, Purcell, and that's their approach is they used to do brainstorms. He's like, that doesn't work. And now they just have small teams sitting quietly in a room working together on ideas and then thinking on their own. So that's such an interesting trend and I feel like IDEO just created this whole, we need to brainstorm post-its, and then everyone's like, that's not actually working. Let's stop doing that.\n\n(00:27:36):\nThe other thing that I feel as you're talking through this, what I'm feeling this is for founders, there's not a manual for starting a company. It feels like this dark art of like, I guess I got to find product market fit. And this idea, it feels like this is almost a manual of everything you need to do to just get the basics of is this even worth doing?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:27:56):\nYeah. And that's why we created it because we still are investing in founders who are... They're incredibly talented and they're smart and they have a background that is going to give them an advantage in building some particular product. But you're right, there's no manual and we were just kind of solving our own problem and we believe in this so much and we see the ROI as being so great that this is the first thing we do when we make an investment.\n\n(00:28:24):\nWe invest in a company and then we run a foundation sprint with them right away. We run more foundation sprints with startups than we do design sprints at this point. And I don't think we can ever encapsulate every single thing that you need to know or that you need to do to start a company, but this is our best take at what you should do in the early days to set yourself up for success and maximize the chances that you're going to reach product market fit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:52):\nAmazing. Okay, let's keep it going. So we've done the basics. What comes next?\n\nJake Knapp (00:28:55):\nYeah, so we've done the basics and another important thing that we've accomplished while going through the sequence of activities and the basics is to boot up the right context into everyone's head so that we're ready for the main event of this first day, which is differentiation. And I still have very firmly in my mind, I grew up with a Mac plus computer and you'd put in the disk and the drive and you'd have to boot up the app that you wanted to run. That's kind of the way our brains work. We have limited working memory and we've got to have the right stuff in there when we're going to make a big decision, when we're going to think hard about a certain problem or question, it's important to have the right context fresh at hand. So the basics is really the context for thinking about differentiation.\n\n(00:29:43):\nAnd differentiation is the heart of what we're doing in the foundation sprint because it goes without saying perhaps, but we like to say it. When you are making a new product, people want to ignore it. People want to not pay attention to it, and if they do have to pay attention to it, if it gets in their face, they want to not try it because we just are all bombarded by so many things and that's never been more true than it is now.\n\n(00:30:10):\nAnd so we have defenses up to save calories in our brain. We don't want to engage. It's crucial then that a product has a clear promise that it makes, and that promise is radically differentiated from the alternatives and that that promise is strong enough that you'll try it and then that the product delivers on that promise. And so when we talk about differentiation, we're saying, look, we want you to be really clear on your promise, not the promise you're making to investors about this technology and what's special about the technology or what's special about the market opportunity, but what the customer at the center. We've started the basics by talking about the customer and the problem they have and the way they see the world.\n\n(00:30:53):\nAnd we want to talk about what you're going to offer to the customer and how it's going to separate from the alternatives. And so in the end of this next phase of the foundation sprint, we're going to have a two-by-two diagram that's going to look like a business school one-on-one diagram. And in fact, we often refer back to this Steve Jobs iPhone introduction slide where he talks about the iPhone and he makes a joke about it. This is a business school one-on-one diagram, but it's really helpful to start developing your product with this clarity about this is the promise we'll make to customers at the end, and we're going to deliver on that promise because we can test and prove that in design sprints. So anyway, we start off, we talk about differentiators and we talk about classic differentiators, fast to slow, smart to not so smart to borrow from the iPhone slide, easy to use to hard to use, and",

So anyway, we start off, we talk about differentiators and we talk about classic differentiators, fast to slow, smart to not so smart to borrow from the iPhone slide, easy to use to hard to use, and so on.\n\n(00:31:44):\nAnd we just start off and have the team, okay, let's just score those up against the competition. Put a sticky note on those continuums showing where you think the product could be. And usually you'll do this and maybe you'll start to see there are a couple places where we can stand out on these classics. That's great. These classics are easily understandable by any customer. We're all sort of familiar with these kinds of things. So okay, that's great. Then we get into writing custom differentiators. So we're going to write a bunch of good things on one end, crummy opposite on the other end, and then we're going to score those. And so for the Latchet story, we'll pick up with Chris and James here. They've written, well, we could really differentiate on networked versus siloed. Our approach is networked. If you're using Shopify, you're siloed, or maybe we can differentiate on painless business growth versus labor-intensive business growth.\n\n(00:32:37):\nSo that might be the specific way we describe the promise of our product. So after evaluating a bunch of these, writing a bunch of these, voting on them quietly, and then the decider's going to say, all right, I don't want to choose a couple of these and we're going to try them out. The teams are going to... If you're running a foundation sprint, you're going to try out a few differentiators. You're going to score against your competitors. You're going to create a scale and you're going to say, okay, let's be honest. Let's be tough. Where do we really think we could stack up against the competitors on this differentiator we've chosen in great detail plotting each company or product one at a time. Okay, so you do that for one differentiator, you do it for another, you do it until you feel like we've got two that are really strong, and then you make that business school one-on-one diagram. And so here's this one for says Lyric, they changed their name to Lachit, so I'm going to edit that real time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:29):\nI love this. So just rebrand.\n\nJake Knapp (00:33:32):\nYeah. So Lachit's up here in the top-right corner and we say, okay, look, this is a good differentiation chart because you've got this quadrant here, this quadrant here, this quadrant here, right? You've got the... So you're in the top-right and you've-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:46):\nYou've got to be in the top-right, you got to be in the top-right.\n\nJake Knapp (00:33:48):\nYou always have to be in the top-right. And if you see those other three quadrants, the top-left, bottom-left, bottom-right, those form an L shape and we call that Loserville. So we want to have a way of looking at the world that puts all of the competitors into Loserville. And then we want to say, okay, if you can deliver on that and if that promise is compelling to customers. So both those things have to be true. Can you deliver on it and do customers care and believe that that matters to them? If both of those things are true, you have a really compelling promise. You have the possibility of a very successful product. So now we've identified that and that becomes a core of our hypothesis. Is that differentiation true? So that's the differentiation step.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:39):\nBefore you move on to the next step, is that where you were going next? Just so I could take a-\n\nJake Knapp (00:34:42):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:43):\nOkay. Follow a couple of threads. This is so awesome. There's just so much value here. Also, just this slide at the end here, folks are watching YouTube. This is your deck slide where you show your competitors and how you're better than them all.\n\nJake Knapp (00:34:57):\nAnd actually I want to jump on that for a second because we've all seen two by two. Hey Graham, right? There's a ton of these. They're all over the place. And if you're anything like me, I just ignored these. I just thought these were pretty much BS up until, well, whenever we started putting these foundations friends three or four years ago. And I think the reason why usually these two by two diagrams feel like this is just consultant baloney. This is just like who... It's because maybe one person makes this chart and they do it quickly because they needed to slide for the slide deck and the audience they're considering, maybe it's investors. And so often these describe technology or they describe the market opportunity, they don't talk about the customer's perspective. And the other thing is that they're not proven. There's no evidence behind the fact that these are true.\n\n(00:35:50):\nSo if they did happen to be about customer perspective, it's unlikely that the whole team would've weighed in on what those differentiators are, and it's very unlikely that we would've tested and proven that matters and that we can deliver on it. And so if you do all of those things and you do it at the beginning of the project,",

And so if you do all of those things and you do it at the beginning of the project, we think this has the potential, when we've seen it becomes this, well, this guiding light, here's the North Star. We need to deliver on this. This is what we have to create. And that helps you make decisions all the way through your product development cycle.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:24):\nJust to point people to justification for why differentiation is so important, there's a couple of episodes that I did that I'll point to in the show notes that just give you more context of why you need to differentiate. So I spoke of David Plastic who is this naming expert that we just had on the podcast. His whole thing is when he's coming up with a name for Sonos or Purcell or Windsor, it has to differentiate. And he talks about this in depth. So we'll point to that episode and this is just like if you're not convinced, why are we spending so much time in differentiation? Also, April Dunford who's like, I don't know, the god of positioning. She has differentiation is such a core part of her approach to positioning. And so there's just so much evidence to tell you that differentiation is a really important step and element of successful companies.\n\nJake Knapp (00:37:13):\nOne of the things that I've noticed about these topics that the basics we talked about already, differentiation, this notion of you need a foundation for your project. It's a bit more under the radar for people. I think it's a bit harder for people to immediately see like, oh, we need this. We see the people who react the strongest to this and have the strongest immediate affinity to this idea actually being start-up founders, people who are really sophisticated in this challenge. Product managers who are at... We were invited in to speak at open AI and anthropic about this, and we see the product people, they're being like, oh my god, this is really powerful. This is the kind of stuff we need.\n\n(00:37:52):\nI think for a lot of folks though, it can sound like this is just elementary, differentiation. Of course we need to differentiate. The problem is that all of this stuff gets backgrounded. It's something we've thought about a bit. We assume we're on the same page, we assume we're going to deliver something, but then business as usual happens, we build a product, we get kind of more interested in the technology and delivering that, and we end up trying to sell it to customers at the end. We end up putting a coat of paint on it with a marketing page or sales deck. We haven't actually built from the beginning the thing that we know is going to matter to people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:28):\nOne of the most useful steps here that I haven't seen before is just a starting place for how to even start thinking about differentiation. Everyone's always probably thinking price and speed maybe. You guys have a really cool just starting list that you showed here. Anything more you can add here for helping people start to think about ways to differentiate beyond the obvious price and speed. And I don't know, a couple more.\n\nJake Knapp (00:38:50):\nSo I'm just going to jump into another startup here just so we can see what this sheet looks like with scores on it. So this is a startup called Mellow. Anyway, the standard classic differentiators where we start, they are fast to slow, smart to not so smart, easy to use to hard to use, free to expensive, focused to one size fits all, simple to complicated and integrated to siloed. And so you could probably argue there's these others that should be included or some of those should be taken off. But what we like about this is that it's a small set. They're easy to understand.\n\n(00:39:31):\nWe know customers can understand these and they create a great starting place for your team to think about differentiation because you can quickly look at this list and start scoring where you think your product could be on these scales and you know that if you can use one of these, people will understand it. But it also starts to make the team comfortable with this notion of differentiation. And again, we want to make differentiation something that all of the co-founders or core team can participate in. It's not just the job of the person writing the pitch deck. It's not just the job of the marketer or the salesperson, but we're getting everybody's perspective in on it and this is a great warm up activity before we start to write our own custom differentiators.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:17):\nAwesome. And then again, this is just inspiration for coming up with more ways to differentiate. Something that is a common question I think for founders is price as a differentiator. Is there any insight you guys have there? How often do you land on price being a good differentiator with the startups you work with?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:40:33):\nI think price is rarely the most important differentiator. Part of what's interesting about going through these classic differentiators, these standard ones first and then jumping into the custom ones is that the classic ones are sort of universal, but it is going to be hard beat the competition on very many of these. It's going to be hard to build a product that's faster than what Google can build or what OpenAI can build. It's",

Part of what's interesting about going through these classic differentiators, these standard ones first and then jumping into the custom ones is that the classic ones are sort of universal, but it is going to be hard beat the competition on very many of these. It's going to be hard to build a product that's faster than what Google can build or what OpenAI can build. It's going to be harder to be cheaper than those competitors because they just have so many more resources. They can have lost leader products that are underpriced. Where I think pricing has become a really clear advantage for some companies is those that are leveraging AI to solve problems that were previously unsolvable with software. So we have a company that we invested in called BindWell and they use AI to design precision pesticides.\n\n(00:41:31):\nAnd we ran a foundation sprint with them right after investing and five years ago you couldn't design pesticides with AI. It wasn't possible. Even if you had that idea, you wouldn't have been able to build it and now you can. And so for them, one of the big advantages is yeah, these pesticides, they can be a lot cheaper because it doesn't require this massive team of R&D chemists to tinker and experiment with things in the lab to try to create new pesticides. We can design them with AI. So it is more often true in AI companies like that, but it's very difficult to compete on price in general. And we think we find that it is not as durable of an advantage as some of these other things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:18):\nThat is such a good point because historically price has been don't compete on price for exactly what you said. It's hard to do long term. It's kind right to the bottom, especially if there's incumbents, they can price a lot lower. But with AI, that is a really often and strong differentiator. Now do this thing like cursor basically is competing on. You're saving engineering time and it's worth so much money to you.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:42:42):\nAt the same time, the output of the AI is probably not going to be quite as good as a human process. So it can be a little bit cheaper for now, but it has to be a lot cheaper. It has to be... I've heard people offer 10X cheaper than the legacy sort of manual approach to solving that problem as the rule of thumb.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:02):\nThat's awesome. Okay. I'll just quickly reference, there's an episode that will come out before this with Modobon about pricing strategy and there's a lot of discussion actually on this.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:43:10):\nOh, great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:10):\nEspecially with how to design your price with customers as you're starting your company. Also, the episode with the founder of Superhuman Rahul, he actually spent, there's a lot of cool context on how he differentiated Superhuman and it was actually very much on speed. His speed actually. Yeah, speed was where he landed. And to your point, it was both... It was the Venn diagram of what you said, can we do this and do people value it? And that's where his research pointed to is people really value this and they were able to achieve it.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:43:38):\nOne of the things that's really interesting about this example here that we're looking at Mellow is that you can see that they were not the best on all these scales. If teams are through and they're being really realistic about how they stack up against the competition, it's normal and natural to find that you're not going to be the best on all these differentiators. And that is really helpful for creating clarity in your positioning and in your marketing because you're not going to show a feature checklist chart that says you're better at everything than every competitor. But if you can drive home one or two things that your customers really care about and that you can be radically better at, it's going to improve your chances of winning and finding product market fit.\n\n(00:44:22):\nAnd we find that going through this process where you're not just thinking about one differentiator at a time or you're not trying to win on all of them, but you're looking across this scale of options and you're being just really honest about where you stack up can both point you in the right direction in terms of what you will win on, but also can give you the comfort to say, hey, it's okay if we're not better than every single company on every single one of these things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:44):\nThat's great context. That's going to make people feel a lot better I think. Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community.

Anything else on differentiation before we move on to the third step of designing your approach?\n\nJake Knapp (00:46:10):\nI think it's worth taking a look at what it looks like when you have a bunch of these custom crafted differentiators, what that might look like. Because in the case of Mellow, we've got, I don't know, there must be 25 here. And so they've written purposeful, magical, clear, personal, provides direction, flexible, human creative, beautiful, and on and on. What they're trying to get at and what we want every team to think about here is what is a new version of reality, a new lens that you can offer to your customers on the world. Because a lot of times you're building a new product, you actually have to change the way people think about what's possible and what matters to them. Those classics are often already well-trodden ground where other people have differentiated, they've already thought about it, but these new particular things that are possible with your technology that you know is possible with the customer problem, the things that you believe might matter.\n\n(00:47:09):\nIt's really interesting to try some very fine-tuned list of sometimes just a slight variation. We slightly change this wording or the way we describe what's great about what we do. And that is the thing we think is really going to stand out. And again, you can see even on this list that they've custom written, when we see where they score it, they're not all the way to the good end of the scale on all of them. When they get honest and look through, they're like, well actually, maybe we can't deliver on this, but this one we really can. And this one we also suspect will matter to customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:43):\nWhere did Mellow land on the differentiators they picked and where did Latchit Land?\n\nJake Knapp (00:47:47):\nYeah, let's take a look. For Mellow, they trade out a bunch before they decided here. So they actually scored with the competitors on these scales.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:47:57):\nAnd just for context, Mellow is a tool that allows you to run very simple, very targeted, very useful AI agents for common everyday tasks like summarizing your email or cleaning up your calendar or drafting responses to messages. And one of their insights was that there's been so many AI products that have over-promised about being able to replace all humans and do anything and 10X year productivity, but so few of them have actually delivered on those promises. And so they have this insight that if they can be really focused and really human and really high quality and they can deliver on that promise of making your life better by offloading tedious tasks that that's going to really click with customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:49):\nThat's a great context. Thank you for adding that.\n\nJake Knapp (00:48:52):\nSo Mellow lands on mobile first and works out of the box if there are two differentiators and they're trying to differentiate from Gumloop and OpenAI is sort of a generalized tool and Latchit they're going to differentiate on...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:10):\nWe're pulling it up. If folks aren't watching, he's pulling up the mirror board to show us where they landed.\n\nJake Knapp (00:49:15):\nLatchit, they're going to differentiate on helps you grow and cooperative. So when they compare against Etsy, when they compare against Shopify or setting up your table at an art fair, they're going to differentiate on helps you grow and cooperative. And they think none of the competitors does both of those things well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:32):\nThat is cool. Thank you for sharing that. And to your point, this is where they think it will work. And then the next step is actually test this in the market, which is where we go from here. So let's move on to the next step in which is the final step of the foundation sprint.\n\nJake Knapp (00:49:45):\nSo closing off differentiation is a short step that is just to create some project principles that'll help you make decisions in line with that differentiation. And you were just talking about superhuman and differentiating on speed. And when John and I worked at Google back in the 2000s, there was this list called 10 Things We've Found To Be True. And one of the things on that list was fast is better than slow. And what was interesting is this is a mantra that you would actually hear people using in meetings to help dictate decisions. Well, we're considering this approach to this view or this approach, this approach renders 12 milliseconds faster. That's probably going to be the one we're going to take. It's going to be a really compelling reason",

We think, hey, this is an easy moment. You've got your differentiators kind of loaded up in your mind. Let's take a second here and just think, what's a principle? How can we turn that into a principle? So if we take a look at Latchit, they've got help sellers help each other. So if they're trying to make a decision between two approaches, well, which one of these helps sellers help each other or do the thing that makes sellers more money? If we're choosing between two things, let's do the one that helps make them more money. And so then we've kind of moved on. We've got a mini manifesto we call it, which is that differentiation chart and these principles. And the notion is this page, the basics page was just kind of the core simple stuff you need to know about this project. The mini manifesto in one page is your decision-making guide.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:39):\nThis is so cool and this looks like it would take a lot of work, but again, this is just a day or two of sitting around working through this framework.\n\nJake Knapp (00:51:48):\nYeah, you'll get to this in four-ish hours.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:52):\nBy the end of the first day, you'll have a mini manifesto that describes how you win essentially as a company and a startup.\n\nJake Knapp (00:51:59):\nOr how you believe it's going to work. And of course, we're going to test it. Now, the next phase of the foundation is-\n\nJake Knapp (00:52:00):\nBelieve it's going to work, and of course we're going to test it. Now the next phase of the foundation Sprint is locking in on the approach we're going to start with. So we'll continue the story of Latch It here, it's easier to use an example than to describe this in the abstract.\n\n(00:52:14):\nSo coming into Character Labs, Latch It had sort of four approaches in mind, but they weren't sure which one to take. So they might build an app, that's one approach they could take. They might build a sort of newsletter platform. That's something obviously they knew how to do. They might build a Shopify plugin, that's a simple way to kind of piggyback on something people are already doing. Their number one competitor is Shopify. Or they might have to build the full stack. And I think a big question for them was, which of these and how much do we have to build before there's enough value for customers that they're actually going to adopt it and we're actually going to get some traction and get this thing going?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:52:52):\nAnd it's important to call out here that all four of these approaches solve the same problem for the same customer. And they're all likely to differentiate from the competition in the same ways based on the unique advantages that the founders Chris and James bring to this company. So these are not wildly different product ideas or company ideas. These are just different approaches. You have the same destination in mind, but you say, \"Hey, which path could we take?\" It's like pulling up directions on Google Maps. This one's a little faster, this one uses less fuel, this one avoids tolls. What's the right approach for us to take?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:27):\nAnd I love the work you did on that first day eliminates a lot of ideas you probably had that you would've probably spent time building and then realizing, \"Okay, this doesn't make any sense. It's just like what everyone else has.\"\n\nJake Knapp (00:53:38):\nTotally, totally, yeah. And we usually see teams starting projects in one of two states. And one state is the state that Latch It finds themselves in where, gosh, there's a few different ways we could do this. How do we decide? We can discuss and discuss and discuss, but that could go on forever. So that's state one. We know there are some options. And state two is we're pretty locked in on one approach already. We think we've got this figured out.\n\n(00:54:07):\nIn either of those cases, we think it's worth taking, again, about four hours-ish to be really careful to lay out the options. If you think there's only one option to sort of force yourself to think, well, what if this doesn't work? What's another alternative? Or is there another alternative that we have previously considered and dismissed that we should maybe reconsider just to make sure? And end with a situation where you've made a decision clearly about, okay, we've considered alternatives. This is our first choice. And you've also identified this is our backup plan. So that failure doesn't seem quite so scary when we start to run experiments. And we're really able to pivot fast should that happen.\n\n(00:54:52):\nSo what we're going to do on the second day of the foundation sprint through this sort of third phase, which is the approach. Is to identify those",

And we're really able to pivot fast should that happen.\n\n(00:54:52):\nSo what we're going to do on the second day of the foundation sprint through this sort of third phase, which is the approach. Is to identify those different paths, so for Latch It here, they've got a B, C and D options. We're going to color code those and then we're going to plot them on these charts. So we've got these different lenses. We call this activity magic lenses. And the notion is, if we had a discussion about it, and we could ... as investors, if we could imagine like waving a magic wand and putting the perfect team of advisors in place to counsel the founders on this decision, we would love for them to have a customer expert, somebody who's just brilliant vision for the product and the customer experience. And they're hammering their fist on the table saying, \"The customer, the customer, the customer, make the decision that's best for the customer.\"\n\n(00:55:42):\nAnd so we'll plot those options on these axes of easy to use versus hard to use and perfect solution to the customer problem versus this is just an okay solution to the customer problem. And then similarly, we want an advisor who's going to pound their fist on the table for building something cheap and fast, getting it out into the market, being pragmatic, get it out there as fast as possible. That's the pragmatic lens. We want somebody who's going to advocate for growth. What's the way to reach the most customers? Get it in people's hands as fast as possible, easy to adopt. We want somebody who's going to advocate for money, for the financial health of a business. So what's going to create long-term value for the customers? Where's the biggest audience of these folks? We want to look at differentiation. Which we spent the first half of the Foundation Sprint establishing. Well, we want consider these approaches through that lens, as well.\n\n(00:56:34):\nAnd so what the teams will do is to plot these options on these lenses. They'll almost always create some lenses of their own, some custom lenses that matter to them. They might have one about their conviction. I think there's sort of a humorous one for Mellow where it's like, which founder is like, \"F yeah, that's exactly what I want to build.\" And on the other end of the spectrum it's like, nah, just kind of the sort of heat of excitement that you feel. That might be a really important decision point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:05):\nThat feels really important. That feels like that should be one of your ... you call these the magic lenses?\n\nJake Knapp (00:57:08):\nYeah, yeah. It probably should be. It probably should be [inaudible 00:57:11]-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:11):\nYeah, I feel like ... just like how excited are you to build this? It feels like a really important piece.\n\nJake Knapp (00:57:14):\nYeah, we saw that one in ... this is our cohort of labs that's going on right now, and I'll bring that one up for context.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:57:22):\nIf we add it, we can call it the Lenny lens.\n\nJake Knapp (00:57:24):\nThe Lenny lens. Yeah. Oh, that's a good idea.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:57:26):\nIn honor of.\n\nJake Knapp (00:57:28):\nYeah, so here it is. And you can see that Marie is more likely to swear than Ben apparently. But it's crucial, right? And many founders, they'll have different ... one of the challenges is that for each founder, I think, each set of founders, there's maybe a different way that they phrase what that means. What conviction means to them. And maybe it's as simple as this, I just feel it, I just know. And sometimes it's a little bit more like, well, it's conviction, but it's also, what's the data that we have behind it? And that's what forms my intuition about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:03):\nAwesome. I love that lens. I love that you asterisk out so it's not a little bit [inaudible 00:58:08].\n\nJake Knapp (00:58:08):\nA little bit. A little ... just slightly concealed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:11):\nSlightly.\n\nJake Knapp (00:58:13):\nYeah, if you zoom in, it's actually not censored.\n\n(00:58:16):\nSo the cool thing about this lens's thing is at the end, you've done all that, you've plotted it all out. And if you're having a conversation like that, you just have to sort of maintain in memory, what did that person say? What did that other person say? What's that conversation I had a week ago? Whatever. Here it's all laid out and sometimes you zoom out and it's honestly as simple as like, \"Oh, hey, look, the blue one is in the top right quadrant of almost every single lens. What is that one? What's going on? That might just be an easy decision.\"\n\n(00:58:49):\nSometimes you zoom out and you say, \"Oh, clearly like nothing wins in every lens.\" And that's actually really reassuring because then you know there is no perfect decision. There's nothing that checks all of the boxes. And that's going to help",

There's nothing that checks all of the boxes. And that's going to help us decide. Because now we decide which is the most important lens, which is the most important viewpoint to take. And you can actually move forward in either way, either situation you get in where there's sort of consistency across all the lenses or there's not. You either pick a lens or you just pick the consensus winner.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:24):\nI love that this step answers a question that's been the back of my mind that I think a lot of people wonder is they're hearing this is just, why don't I just build something and launch it and learn? And why am I spending all this time sitting in a room? And this to me is a big part of the answer is just spending an hour or two thinking through, here's the ideas we have. How do they compare on ... how do they look on these magical lenses? Which makes so much sense. How do they just filter on what customers will love most, will help us grow the fastest, we'll drive the most money? Things like that. It's such a simple, quick exercise that will save you so much time building and launching and having to spend time learning. That is weeks, days, months of work versus a couple hours. It could save you so much over that time.\n\nJake Knapp (01:00:10):\nAnd it's also the case that you start building something. It's exciting, you can move fast. It's easier and easier to see progress now with AI tools. And that act of building and starting to create something has a momentum of its own that can be hard to stop. And if you're headed in the wrong direction, you can spend a lot of time building and making progress. But it's just, if it's not progress in the right direction, it's actually hurting you.\n\n(01:00:41):\nAnd that's why we want people to pause and take this. It's really, as you said earlier, the ROI is high. But it feels very unnatural to pause when you're so excited at the beginning and ready to go. To pause and say, \"Okay, let's make sure we're taking the right path.\" But just imagine you're Gandalf, you're Frodo, you're starting off, you're trying to get to Mordor, it's a long trip. You don't want to take the wrong path. You want to take the ... think before you start marching through the swamps or whatever.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:01:14):\nOne phenomenon we've seen when teams are building things really quickly with AI is that the more AI-generated or assisted they are, the more generic they tend to turn out. Which makes sense if you think about how LLMs were developed, they're all basically pre-trained on the same data. And so in this excitement, in this rush to say, \"Wow, look at how fast we can build it.\" You actually end up with something that is less differentiated than what already exists in the world. And then let's say you launch it, and that takes longer than building sort of a clickable prototype. But you launch it because you're moving so fast.\n\n(01:01:48):\nAnd then you get data from the people who managed to find that thing about what they did with it. But you don't get any data about what they didn't do with it. And you certainly don't get any data about the people who never found it, who never tried it. Maybe they landed on your website and they're like, blah, another generic AI-generated thing, that's not worth my time. And so we think it's really helpful to basically put yourself in a situation where you can slow down a little bit and do some hard thinking, some deep thinking about what's actually going to make your product unique. And then you can switch into this mode of like, okay, great. Now let's go as fast as possible and get that out into customer's hands. But if you don't take this step first, it's actually kind of counterintuitive that going fast can actually slow you down in the long run.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:40):\nYeah, to build on that, I had this guest recently, Bob Baxley.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:02:43):\nYeah, we know Bob.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:45):\nOkay. So he has this really interesting insight. He calls it ... I think he calls it the Primal Mark. Essentially his feedback is, wait as long as possible to start any sort of sketch or prototype, because as soon as you start drawing what you're building, now everything you do will be a response to that. And so the more time you can spend before starting to concept out the solution, the more likely you are to land on something that works.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:03:12):\nThat is super interesting and it is-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:17):\nCounterintuitive [inaudible 01:03:18].\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:03:18):\nAnd I find myself challenged to think about it in the context of the sprints that we run with founders. But I think one way to interpret that in the work that we do is that we used to just run design sprints with every team, that was our hammer and everything looked like a nail.

But I think one way to interpret that in the work that we do is that we used to just run design sprints with every team, that was our hammer and everything looked like a nail. And part of what we found so valuable about doing the Foundation Sprint is that it keeps you away from ideation for just a little bit longer. And it forces you to think about why you're unique and the market that you're going into before you get to that moment of creating something that looks realistic and then maybe being a little bit locked into that approach.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:00):\nThat's such a ... like I love that this emerged out of that. Like you guys were so design sprint oriented, and it's just like, cool, let's just make prototypes, let's design, let's make it real, let's show people. And that's, I think, where a lot of people's minds are at more and more. And maybe as a result, and this is almost like, okay, maybe that wasn't the right approach to start. Maybe it's actually better to think a little bit of what we want to design and build before. And so just the fact that you guys spent so much of your life and time on that. And then realize this is actually potentially even more important to do, it says a lot.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:04:33):\nAnd ideas always get distilled down to one thing that people grab onto and they focus on. And I think with the design sprint, it got distilled down to just build a prototype. Just quit messing around and build something. But the reality is when you run a design sprint, it's five days and you don't build the prototype until the fourth day. So you do a bunch of work to figure out how does our customer learn about this thing? What are the different ideas that we're bringing to what our solution could look like? Which of those are the most likely to work? And only then at the end of the week are you building a prototype.\n\n(01:05:14):\nBut I do think that as that method has become really widely known, people just think about let's build something. And then once you multiply that times the power of AI, it definitely creates this narrative that the only way to build something new is to just create the product as quickly as possible. And that doesn't really match our experience, that doesn't really fit the pattern of what we've seen working best across the few hundred companies that we've worked with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:44):\nI think this validates in some ways the role of a product manager where the PM's job is to help the team figure out what should we be building and are we all aligned on what we're building before we start designing and building? This process is almost like the product requirements document of a company. Which I think a lot of product people listening to this will feel really good about.\n\nJake Knapp (01:06:09):\nYeah, we see this as a great tool for product people. It's a way to give you a structure for leading your team through those decisions. And a way to give all the folks on a team, including the person who's the product leader. But the person who's the engineering leader, the person who's the marketing leader, sales leader, the design leaders, the exact right opportunity to contribute and participate in forming the strategy. The exact right opportunity as we get into design sprints, following the foundation sprints, to then make it real. And turn that idea, that hypothesis about what might work into hopefully evidence that it does work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:54):\nI feel like it's actually more helpful to engineers, like non-product people, because I think a PM my brain would be like, I want to do this intuitively. Whether they do it right or not. I think it's other functions almost they're like, no, let's just jump straight to design, straight to prototyping.\n\n(01:07:11):\nLet me ask you ... while we're on this tangent, we're on this wild tangent out of this process, but want to ... this question has been in my mind. Because I recently had a founder on the podcast, Maor, who built this company called Base44. He built it, it sold in six months for $80 million. And this journey of that is he just had a problem he wanted to solve for himself, for his girlfriend, for a scouts program. He built it, people started using it, and he kind of evolved it from there. And obviously he didn't go through a process like this. Thoughts on just like, is it okay to just do that? When should someone think about, \"Okay, I should actually set aside time to do a Foundation Sprint.\" Versus, I'm just motivated to solve a problem for my friends. I'm just going to build it, evolve it, iterate with them, and kind of go from there.\n\nJake Knapp (01:07:58):\nOne of the observations from our hundreds of experiences working alongside founders in the early days of their projects and watching them make decisions and watching them try things and succeed or fail, is that there are so many founders who are incredibly bright, incredibly capable. They have great insights about the market, about an opportunity. And yet, their startup does not work out. And there's a problem with selection bias that we hear from the folks who they were brilliant, they checked all those boxes I just described. They saw a great opportunity, they were smart, they executed well, they had courage and conviction, and they did it and it worked out, and it was a tremendous success.\n\n(01:08:51):\nAnd I think",

But what we believe is you have a better ... this just increases your odds. This is a chance to get more clear on, is this a good opportunity? To get more clear on, will the thing I build click with customers?\n\n(01:09:14):\nAnd if you've already figured out that no, this thing's ... my product has taken off, my product is working. We've actually had founders in labs who they started off character labs and they said, \"I started selling this thing and it's already taking off. I want to stop running experiments.\" And we're like, \"Yeah, stop running experiments.\" You don't need to do this if you've got product market fit, if you've got evidence that this thing is clicking and you have conviction, run with it. But if you're not there, this is a great path to get you going. And if you're not sure if the thing you're going to build is going to turn into that $80 million exit in six months, we believe this is a good chance to improve your odds.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:59):\nPeople hearing this might feel like, I haven't heard of any company doing this that has become a trillion dollar IPO success. What would make me believe that this is the process I should follow versus just, I'm just going to do what I hear on YC, just build it, launch it, iterate, that kind of thing. What can you share to give people confidence this is the approach to take?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:10:20):\nWell, the first thing I'd say is give us some time where we're pretty new to this. We started Character Labs about three years ago. We created the Foundation Sprint about three years ago. But more seriously, when we were creating this method, one of the things that we did was look back across all the projects we've been involved in and the ones that were really successful, and we looked for patterns. And while those teams didn't have the Foundation Sprint, they ended up having really clear differentiation and a really clear view of what made them unique that they were able to build on. And as we ran design sprints with them, we were able to test and validate against that differentiation. So we believe that this is sort of a key to success, even if those teams didn't have access to this exact same methodology.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:07):\nSo what I'm hearing is this is essentially like Alpha in starting a company. This is a new process that companies are just starting to use. You guys are working closely with founders, and it's rooted in the success of many, many, many companies that you guys were involved in early on and continue to be involved in.\n\nJake Knapp (01:11:25):\nYeah, it's based off of this thing we've seen again and again in the most successful projects. When we're inside the room in the early days and we're seeing people make decisions, this is what drives those decisions. It's differentiation. And so if we look back across all of the sprints that we've been a part of over the years, and John and I have been inside lots of these rooms, lots of these conversations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:51):\nAnd if you're not watching on YouTube, by the way, there's a cool visual that Jake is showing.\n\nJake Knapp (01:11:55):\nYeah, it spans across Google, Google Ventures, Character Capital, and if you're watching on YouTube, you'll see all these little white circles. And each one sort of represents a company that we've seen inside of during these design sprints. And there are a lot of really great success stories in there. We've had the chance to ... I mentioned the story of Google Meet and being there and figuring out what is it that's going to make this thing stand out? That was what made the project finally start to take off. And to this day is still sort of what animates it. Being inside of the early days of what became Google Photos or Google Trips and some of the early design sprints, and there are a lot of others on here.\n\n(01:12:35):\nBut honestly, of course, we've also seen inside a lot that it didn't work out. If we looked inside the greatest hits though, the real smash successes, we looked inside all of those. We realized there is a common element, and that common element in all of them is differentiation. That there was clarity around this is what we're trying to prove to customers, this is the promise we're making. And so we've been on those teams, or we've worked alongside those founders who have this clear idea of differentiation. And sometimes they're not right. They run the experiments and they change it. But the thing is, they're keyed into differentiation as being crucial. They're not just thinking about the product and trying to get the right shape of the product or trying to make it usable or whatever. They're really keyed in on differentiation and how do we find the right promise and deliver on that promise and express that promise to customers.\n\n(01:13:28):\nSo to explain a little bit quickly of what I mean by differentiation and how this has manifested in products we've seen, if you go back to",

They're really keyed in on differentiation and how do we find the right promise and deliver on that promise and express that promise to customers.\n\n(01:13:28):\nSo to explain a little bit quickly of what I mean by differentiation and how this has manifested in products we've seen, if you go back to the early days of Gmail in the 2000s, if you had email, you were probably using Hotmail or Yahoo and it worked fine and you didn't have to think about it. And this new product comes along and you're like, \"God, I'm not going to want to switch my email address. What a hassle. Who wants to do that? No one.\" Gmail's promise was, hey, massive storage, great search. And as we were building the product out and marketing and explaining it to people and making decisions inside the project, we had to continue to deliver on great search. Great search, great search, that was key to standing out.\n\n(01:14:10):\nYou fast forward to 2014, and we're working with this tiny company who's now competing with Gmail, who's now sort of the market leader people are used to using in their teams. And here's this new messaging software called Slack, and they're trying to reach new customers. And gosh, switching to Slack is an even bigger hassle than switching to your email address because everybody on the team has to switch. Well, Slack says, \"Hey, if you believe that having fun and boosting teamwork is important, it's going to be clear to you. This is a new way of looking at the world.\" And when they were making their decisions in their first big ad campaign, their first big marketing campaign, this was what they were trying to convey to customers. So we kind of see that from the inside.\n\n(01:14:53):\nAnother one, we didn't see this one from the inside, but in one that we're all sort of familiar with is what happened with ChatGPT. It goes from this trusted, I don't have to think about it, I'm going to run a Google search. To, oh, wow. It's a new way of looking at the world. There's zero clicks, just tells you the answer. This thing's great.\n\n(01:15:08):\nThis is also something that we've seen in some of the early success stories from our own portfolio. So 2019, this company called Reclaim going after calendar management. And most of us manage our own calendars, most of us don't have administrators helping us out with that. And it's free, we're in control. Reclaim's argument was, hey, we can automatically, we can use AI to help you focus and to automatically prioritize your calendar. And that animated enough people to take the plunge and switch and try it out, that they were able to build up an audience of tens of thousands of users, and Dropbox acquired them last year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:46):\nA great answer to my question, you guys well-prepared for those skeptics.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:15:52):\nPart of our motivation, our selfish motivation with this Foundation Sprint is that now that we are investing our own money into companies and we're working with all these founders, we want them to have that same clarity on differentiation. We saw how important that was to Gmail and to Slack and to all these other companies. And we want to bring that, we want to give them that same advantage and help them avoid the pitfalls that all the other unsuccessful teams and companies that we've seen have fallen into. So that's kind of what we're trying to do here, is bring the lessons from these really successful teams into any team that reads the book and runs this process.\n\nJake Knapp (01:16:33):\nAnd the special sauce that John and I bring is that we're obsessed with the sequence of decisions that you make and how you work together with your team to make good decisions quickly. And that specificity about the method is something that we do have a lot of evidence behind it working well because of what's happened with the design sprint and with how many successful teams have run that at those companies who are trillion dollar or whatever kind of giant ... all kinds of teams run design sprints. This is that same methodology around how we work together at high velocity and high quality. And it's just brought to a different part of the process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:14):\nExcellent answer. Speaking of the method, we went on the world's most epic tangent. I want to bring us back. We haven't finished actually going through the process. I think we're towards the tail end of it. So let's just finish that. What else do you do? So you have this ... I guess, catch us up.\n\nJake Knapp (01:17:30):\nLet's catch up with Latch It. So as a refresher for you who forgot. Latch It are building this tool for artisans, they want to help them sell with the community networking features like you might find on Substack. And they've identified their differentiation, they've identified their approach now using magic lenses. And all of this is going to come together to create a founding hypothesis. So if we help Artisans solve online sales growth with a social sales app, and then they've also got their backup plan.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:03):\nOr we could-\n\nJake Knapp (01:18:00):\nA social sales app. Then, they've also got their backup plan, or we could build the full stack solution if that doesn't work. We believe they're going to choose it over Shopify and Etsy because our solution is cooperative and easy to use. In this single sentence,",

In this single sentence, we've laid bare their strategy, and now they're going to try to find out does that work?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:21):\nThat is so cool. The output of the sprint is the founding hypothesis. I love that the term hypothesis is a part of this because it's not telling you this will work. It's this is the thing you will now test.\n\nJake Knapp (01:18:34):\nAbsolutely. Every project has at its core ... Every new product has at its core a hypothesis. There is a founding hypothesis. It's just usually not explicit. It's usually hidden, and different people on the team may have different ideas about what it is.\n\n(01:18:50):\nBecause it's not explicit, it's very hard to interrogate it and test it and find out if the different variables in it are the right variables.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:00):\nI'm curious what's in that photo to the right as you're showing the YouTube.\n\nJake Knapp (01:19:02):\nOh, yeah, if you're on YouTube. We did this spread together in person. On Lachit's board, you're going to see that here's where they wrote it out and took a photo of it and dropped it in, and then later filled it out on the Miro board.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:18):\nBeautiful. It has their old name there there.\n\nJake Knapp (01:19:20):\nThat's right. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:21):\nEvery brand that.\n\nJake Knapp (01:19:22):\nLyric, which it turns out is not the easiest for SEO. There's a lot of lot of Lyrics out there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:27):\nThere is a lot of Lyrics. I know some Lyrics. Just so I understand, is the next step, the design sprint, and that's where you actually start testing?\n\nJake Knapp (01:19:34):\nExactly. If we zoom out now we see now they're going to head into a sequence of design sprints running one after another. Each of those design sprints starts with the founding hypothesis.\n\n(01:19:44):\nThen, the team is going to say, \"Okay, what are the biggest risks that ... That hypothesis not being true? What do we need to assess right now?\"\n\n(01:19:52):\nGoing to make a map of how customers discover the product, what that core experience looks like, and then figure out using that map, where's the key moment for assessing that risk?\n\n(01:20:02):\nFor them, the biggest risk is do people even ... Will these artisans even want this thing? Are they actually going to want to have a community sharing sales platform? They decide the key moment for us to test that, it's actually on the landing page. They figure we can prototype landing pages that describe the product and learn a lot for our first experiment, just with landing pages.\n\n(01:20:23):\nThey're going to sketch solutions. This will be familiar to anyone who's heard about design sprints. Each person sketching their own proposal for how that key moment should work. Choose the strongest of those.\n\n(01:20:35):\nIn this case, they choose ... They're going to actually prototype three things. They test three things head-to-head against each other, fake brands for each one. They look like three different products.\n\n(01:20:46):\nThen, this is a really key part. At the end of the design sprint, we've got a scorecard. This is actually a new innovation. This is not in the [inaudible 01:20:54].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:53):\nOh, shit. Here we go. Hot off the presses, design sprint improvement.\n\nJake Knapp (01:20:59):\nThis scorecard is going to break down the founding hypothesis. Hey, as we talk to each customer, was this the right person? Is the right kind of customer for us? Do they have the problem that we think they have? Was this the right approach for them? Did they choose it over the competition?\n\n(01:21:14):\nThey're going to test these prototypes head-to-head, and also show people like, okay, here's Etsy, here's Shopify. Now, out of all these five options, think about, out loud, about how do you compare these? Do we believe they'd actually choose it? Did the differentiation actually work? Are those differentiators valuable and motivating to them? Does it click?\n\n(01:21:36):\nOur new book is called Click. The idea there is you can see when a product clicks with one person, and that's a helpful signal. Now, granted, these interviews are kind of a simulation. It's not like the real world, but they're a helpful signal that we're on track for product market fit. If we see, gosh, this product just seems to be clicking with customer after customer, that's a really strong signal. That's when people start to get the confidence that it's time to build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:03):\nThat's a really good term, by the way. I feel that's such a good way to describe what it feels like. It doesn't just click",

If you look across Latchet's first scorecard, there's a ton of red. It's a lot of things that didn't work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:17):\n[inaudible 01:22:17].\n\nJake Knapp (01:22:18):\nThe conclusion at the end ... In this last column, there's a conclusion, hey, we interviewed ... In this case, they interviewed four customers. Well, it looks like this is the right customer. It looks like they have this problem, but everything else kind of didn't work about the hypothesis. Approach wasn't working, differentiation wasn't working. There's some mini hypotheses about the prototype itself. Just lots of red on here, so they sprint again and-\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:22:42):\nJust zooming out for a second, this is a team who just started working on this new company. Sometimes it can feel slow. We talked about it feeling slow to go through all these steps, but they're only a week in. They've already built three prototypes, and they've tested those three prototypes with four real customers.\n\n(01:23:01):\nThey have this super detailed scorecard of here's what's working, here's what's not working. That's after a week. It's interesting how what can feel slow in the hour to hour actually can really speed you up in the weeks and months timescale.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:17):\nThat was such good context, because I was feeling that. To your point, most founders do not do this much testing, iterating, learning in the first few weeks of their startup.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:23:26):\nYeah. They might spend a few weeks just talking to customers without showing a prototype, and then they might spend a few months building an MVP, and then they might ... Maybe they're going to spend some more time talking to customers while showing them the MVP. Maybe they'll do manual onboarding, something like that.\n\n(01:23:41):\nYeah, that plays out over months. It fits with what founders tell us. Of course it's a subjective measure, but founders who go through this process with us, they say that they're able to accelerate three to four months of work into the three or four weeks back-to-back sprints that we're doing together in Character Labs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:59):\nExcellent context. Thanks for throwing that in there.\n\nJake Knapp (01:24:01):\nThese conversations with customers are so much more fruitful and pointed when you've got the context of I know exactly what my hypothesis is and you have prototypes to show them.\n\n(01:24:11):\nWe have a founder in our group of startups and Character Labs at the moment. I'm thinking of Maruthi John who comes from doing sales at Rippling, who had been talking to tons of customers while starting off the ... His company. He said, \"I've had 50 conversations over the past month, but I learned so much more from even the first conversation when I had a hypothesis and I had a prototype, or a couple prototypes, to show them. It's like night and day.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:42):\nThat is a great example. This all makes sense. As you guys describe it, you're actually testing something very concrete that your entire team is aligned behind and actual prototypes, and you've thought about different directions. You're testing something very specific versus just generally testing at your general concept.\n\nJake Knapp (01:25:03):\nAs we go into the second design sprint for Latchet, they're making some edits to their founding hypothesis. Now, they're revising a few things, making new sketches, new proposals for what this solution might look like. They've learned a lot in that first sprint, a new prototype. They've got a prototype that has more detail now. They are engineers. They're starting to actually write some code and put some more detail behind the product. It's more robust. Again, they're trying to fix that positioning.\n\n(01:25:36):\nHere's their scorecard. If you're watching on YouTube, you'll be able to see it. Again, there's a lot of red here. At first blush, the scorecard is bleeding, but there are some promising signs. There's like maybe a few little sunbreaks, there's some spots where some of the red has started to flip to yellow.\n\n(01:25:54):\nIf we look at the conclusion on the far right, they're starting to believe their differentiation is dialed in, and they're starting to believe that this could be the right approach. They may be able to get people to choose it to the competition, even though they haven't done it yet. Those are starting to become yellow lights on the scorecard.\n\n(01:26:12):\nNow they'll take what they've learned, and now we're into the third consecutive week of design sprints. Again, they're going to sort of review that founding hypothesis. They're going to sketch. They're recruiting a new slate of customers, as they do each week. A new prototype, again, more code in the prototype. It's becoming more and more robust, more realistic as they're also adjusting the marketing and the positioning at the same time.\n\n(01:26:37):\nAll of these things kind",

This is a real example.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:58):\nWow. How do I invest to get us in this round? This is great.\n\nJake Knapp (01:27:03):\nYes, this is pretty great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:03):\nThis is great. Nice job.\n\nJake Knapp (01:27:06):\nWe see this again and again. I can share a couple of other boards of ones that are in progress. We're also constantly adjusting the template so you can get to see a little bit more how people will edit their founding hypothesis from sprint to sprint.\n\n(01:27:20):\nMellow, who we were talking about, here's their first prototype, and here's their first scorecard. Lots of yellow for them. Maybe they're a little bit more likely to use yellow than red.\n\n(01:27:31):\nThen, here's the edits to their founding hypothesis after the first sprint. You can kind of see in red, they're slightly changing the definition of their target customer from the first week, slightly changing the problem that they're solving, slightly changing the approach, slightly changing the competition.\n\n(01:27:49):\nThey've dialed in, they've gotten more crisp on who are we up against. They've gotten a little bit more crisp, just a tiny tweak, on what ... How do we explain this to people to get them excited about it? What's the differentiation? They sprint again, they prototype again. If we just jump down, and just looking at hypotheses, they learn a bunch. Now there's another slight tweak to that founding hypothesis. Week after week you're learning, but you're also really able to track exactly what is it that we learned and how does that affect our strategy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:20):\nOkay, guys, this was incredible. I think we've covered the entire process. I love that you also covered the design sprint pieces, which isn't part of this book, but is such a core.\n\n(01:28:31):\nClearly these things are very connected and meant to work together. You go from here's the thing we should be building to how to actually test it.\n\n(01:28:39):\nLet me ask you before we wrap up, is there anything else that you think is really important for people to know before they start trying this process at home? Is there anything you can point them to actually try this at home?\n\nJake Knapp (01:28:51):\nOne thing we didn't talk about, we used an example of a company who's not building an AI-first product. Latchet's building this network community sales platform for artisans.\n\n(01:29:06):\nIt'd probably be interesting to look at how people use this when they are building a very technical product, when they're vibe coding prototypes. That's a question we're getting all the time. What's the influence on this of the speed with which you can build something?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:19):\nThat's an awesome idea. Let's definitely do that.\n\nJake Knapp (01:29:20):\nYeah. Okay. Let's jump in here and take a look at a company again, in our current group of labs teams, Axion Orbital it's called. The founder, [inaudible 01:29:30], is actually running this whole process solo, which is pretty cool too. He's a remarkable guy. We have a couple of solo founders right now who are able to generate ...\n\n(01:29:40):\nYou can see, just to give a sneak peek, he's generating, when we talk about customers, all these sticky notes himself and making the decisions himself about which is the right one.\n\n(01:29:48):\nTo ground us in this story, his founding hypothesis is he wants to help geospatial devs solve these sort of complex workflows with a browser-based no-code development environment. We'll take a look just really quickly at what his prototypes look like.\n\n(01:30:05):\nIn the first week ... I can show you this prototype right here, and it's a marketing page. On this marketing page, there's a link to a video. If I click find out more, I'm going to see this video. This video is going to kind of hear [inaudible 01:30:27] talking over it.

Not the most polished-looking. This doesn't look super compelling.\"\n\n(01:30:50):\nHe was focusing in that first sprint on the messaging, on finding those people who actually have that role, testing it with them, and he learned a lot. If we sort of go back to his scorecard, we'll see, okay, that was a pretty good one. Actually, a lot of green on his first scorecard, but he also felt like what he tested was pretty incomplete.\n\n(01:31:10):\nNow, one thing that's cool here, we saw the big leap with Latchet from one week to another in terms of their learnings and the scorecards. One of the things that's interesting here is to go from [inaudible 01:31:19]'s first prototype here to his second prototype.\n\n(01:31:23):\nIt's obvious he's been able to just build a ton in the next week. He's using AI-based tools. He's doing a lot of work. He's also just a terrific engineer. Here we've got a much more real-looking marketing page, very detailed.\n\n(01:31:38):\nAn important thing that he's done here with this is he's built out a lot and created a video of something so that the product, while not fully functional, you can see exactly how it works. If we sort of play this video, he's created this demonstration of what it looks like when you type in a query into the engine and exactly the kinds of results you get. By doing a combination of vibe coding, real coding, all of which is based off of pencil sketches, we can go back and see the sketches he's doing on paper to define this is what I think needs to be in there to make this compelling to deliver on my differentiation, and then he's using a product video so that the entire thing doesn't have to work fully freeform. That's what it can look like when a team is building something that's more AI-centric, when it's a more sophisticated tool, when people are going to be curious about sort of the ins and outs of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:33):\nAlong those lines, where do you find people are leveraging AI most in helping them through these sprints, through either the foundation sprint or the design sprint? Is it mostly just vibe coding prototypes?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:32:45):\nThat's definitely the first and biggest use of AI in sprints so far is in making prototypes that look more realistic faster. It's kind of like having an entire prototyping team on standby so that you don't have to just make it yourself and sort of piece things together, but you can have a ton of people ready to jump in, make something look really realistic.\n\n(01:33:12):\nIt's also really critical we found that while you're outsourcing that prototyping work, you don't outsource the thinking. You don't kind of skip over the part where you think about, \"Well, what is the actual copy on the website? How do I actually describe what the product is, how it's differentiated?\" It's one of the reasons why doing the foundation sprint first and then doing a design sprint can really help you, because it allows you to spend time working on that harder part of what it means to design and build a product.\n\n(01:33:48):\nThen, once you have a clear view of that, then you can use AI tools to go really fast. In this example that Jake is showing of Axion Orbital, people get really clever about which parts of this need to be real, which parts of this can be vibe coded, which parts of this can just be a static Figma mockup.\n\n(01:34:04):\nIt's all about kind of creating a simulation, something that looks realistic, that you can put in front of real customers to help you answer the key questions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:14):\nThat's a really good point that you're making. Again, it's just a reminder, you'll move faster if you slow down a little bit at the beginning, that because prototyping is so easy now and just things that look ... It's so easy to make something that looks really nice and kind of it's doing what you want, but spending a little time making sure you understand what you're testing and what you want becomes more important.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:34:33):\nWe had a couple of teams in this current group of Character Labs where they jumped to vibe coding prototypes right away at the very beginning.\n\n(01:34:43):\nWhen you generate something using an LLM, using an AI tool, it looks pretty real. It looks believable. I think there's a temptation to say, \"Okay, this is good to go. It looks close enough that I'm just going to show that to customers.\"\n\n(01:34:58):\nThen what they found was, actually, it was super generic. It didn't really describe what the product was. It didn't really describe how it was different because it was generated by a model that is trained on existing products.\n\n(01:35:15):\nIn that second sprint, that was when they really took a step back and",

Doing this level of thought where you're pausing, you're being really intentional about what does the customer need to know, what needs to happen for them to find a solution to their problem and within the product, that's a way of doing your prompt engineering.\n\n(01:36:04):\nIf you end up vibe coding this prototype, but you start off with a very clear plan about this is what the thing needs to look like, rather than going immediately into a conversational mode where you're co-designing with the LLM and going back and forth via chat conversation, this is much likelier to yield an opinionated product that makes sense, that's very clearly defined around the problem that you're trying to solve, the tasks that need to happen to solve that problem, and the right messaging, the right wording. It's really crisply aligned with what you know about your customers, what you know about what they care about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:40):\nThat's such a good point. Again, just the concept of the primal mark is ringing in my head as you talk about this. Just as soon as you make that prototype, everything from that point is a response to that first idea, versus have I actually thought through what this should be.\n\n(01:36:54):\nGuys, we did it. This is incredible. I think this is going to help a lot of people think through and actually save a lot of time. Is there anything else that you want to share, leave listeners with? Maybe a last nugget or something you want to, I don't know, just double down on to leave folks with before we wrap up.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:37:11):\nWell, one quick thing is that we've shared a lot of examples in this conversation. We actually have a template, a Miro template, that folks can use if they want to run their own foundation sprint.\n\n(01:37:24):\nIt's the template that we use when we're working with founders, taking them through these sprints. We do our work in Miro. Even if we're in person with them, we're usually working in Miro, or maybe working on paper and then capturing it in Miro because it's just such a great canvas to work on.\n\n(01:37:39):\nWe'll make that template available so anybody who's listening or watching can grab that and use it to run their own foundation sprint.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:47):\nThat's amazing. You answered the question I asked that I forgot to come back to. Can we give people a URL? Put it in the show notes, but is it at your ... Yeah, I guess where can folks find it?\n\nJake Knapp (01:37:57):\nYou should find it at character.vc. You can go there and we'll have a page for you to ... Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:04):\nAmazing. So easy. That is awesome. That's awesome that you guys are doing that. Obviously you could also read the book. That goes through a lot of this process, but I think the template is just like a plug and play. Let's just do this at home.\n\n(01:38:15):\nObviously, if they want to go deeper, they can work with you guys to have you ... It's such a win. They take money. You give them money and you help them figure out what the heck to build. What a deal. That's also character.vc if they want to explore that.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:38:28):\nYeah. Yep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:29):\nAmazing. Okay. Is there anything else, Jake, that you wanted to share before we close up?\n\nJake Knapp (01:38:35):\nNo, just if you made it this far, hopefully your mind and heart is open to this idea, but we know it's a lot to ask, to clear the calendar and follow these steps. If John and I weren't so convinced that beginnings are essential to getting your best efforts in the hands of people and to achieving the things you want for your customers, we wouldn't be doing this. We wouldn't be going to all the trouble. There are simpler things we could be going after.\n\n(01:39:08):\nThe kind of cool thing we've found about working in this way, though, we've focused a lot on finding product market fit and building your business, getting started, getting momentum, getting alignment, all these things that tactically are important, that",

Because you're interacting with them, you're focusing on them as you plan and you're interacting with them on a weekly basis when you work in this way, and how close it brings teammates together in a very authentic way.\n\n(01:39:46):\nWe're working together on the most important things.

What have you learned about how to garner trust and win over skeptics?\n\nPaige Costello (00:00:07):\nThe thing I would say is bring the insight. Know thy customer. Know thy market. Know thy competitors. Know thy numbers. Know thy product.\n\nLenny (00:00:15):\nI'm curious, what you find most holds back new PMs?\n\nPaige Costello (00:00:19):\nYour brain is so accustomed to having a scarcity mindset as opposed to creating alternative options or seeing a different path. Effectively, there's this notion of, \"How might the opposite be true?\" The moment I challenged myself and said, \"How might the opposite be true?\" my shoulders dropped. I felt more relaxed. I was like, \"Oh, yeah, I can do both. It will be fine.\"\n\nLenny (00:00:45):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Paige Costello. Paige is a product lead at Asana overseeing teams responsible for the core product experience of Asana. Before Asana, she was Director of Product at Intercom, and prior to that, she was a group product manager at Intuit where she spent five and a half years. In our wide-ranging conversation, we dig into strategies for building trust with people who are more experienced than you or older than you, we talk about coaching product managers, including why leading by example is often the most effective strategy, we talk about Asana's product development process and how it's evolved over the years as the company has scaled, plus some of Paige's product and career missteps, and what she's learned from those moments. To prep for this interview, I got input from some of Paige's colleagues and former colleagues, and everyone I talked to loved Paige. You'll soon see why. Enjoy this episode with Paige Costello after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:47):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Brave Search and their newest product, the Brave Search API, an independent global search index you can use to power your search or AI apps. If your work involves AI, then you know how important new data is to train your LLMs and to power your AI applications. You might be building an incredible AI product, but if you're using the same data sets as your competitors to train your models, you don't have much of an advantage. Brave Search is the fastest growing search engine since Bing, and it's 100% independent from the big tech companies. Its index features billions of pages of high-quality data from real humans, and it's constantly updated thanks to being the default search engine in the Brave browser.\n\n(00:02:29):\nIf you're building products with search capabilities, you're probably experiencing soaring API costs or lack of viable global alternatives to Bing or Google. It's only going to become harder to afford these challenges. The Brave Search API gives you access to its novel web scale data with competitive features, intuitive structuring, and affordable costs. AI devs will particularly benefit from data containing thorough coverage of recent events. Lenny's Podcast listeners can get started testing the API for free at brave.com/lenny. That's brave.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:04):\nThis episode is brought to you by Attio, a new type of CRM that's powerful, flexible, and built around your data.

Great to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:08):\nSo you don't know this, and I've been telling you this, but I asked a bunch of people that you worked with and maybe currently work with for questions, suggestions of things to ask you. So this is going to be really fun.\n\nPaige Costello (00:04:19):\nWonderful. Now, I want to know who you talked to, but we'll find out.\n\nLenny (00:04:23):\nI'll tell you right now. Big thank you to Jackie Bavaro, Yasmin who's on your team, and Montgomery and Steve Morin who is currently at Asana.\n\nPaige Costello (00:04:32):\nOoh, fun.\n\nLenny (00:04:33):\nSo thank you to all of those folks for giving me a bunch of great questions, suggestions.\n\nPaige Costello (00:04:37):\nLooking forward to it.\n\nLenny (00:04:38):\nMaybe just to settle a context, can you just talk about...

What do you work on, and what is your team responsible for broadly?\n\nPaige Costello (00:04:45):\nYeah. Absolutely. So I lead the product organization that's responsible for our desktop, web, and mobile apps at Asana. The teams are composed of all the people in San Francisco and New York who are focused on creating clarity for individuals, teams, and organizations. Effectively, our goal is to help teams work together more efficiently and drive the outcomes they're going for. So you can think about the feature sets if you're an Asana user like goals, portfolios, projects, tasks, reporting, all of that. But really, we want to help people answer the question at work, \"Who is doing what by when, and why?\" So that notion of clarity of purpose, clarity of plan, progress, and responsibility are often so painful in people's work lives. When there is certainty there and clarity there, people can be much more efficient in getting the work done. So that's where my focus is every day. I'm a product leader for that group.\n\nLenny (00:05:44):\nCool. So, basically, like the core. When people think of Asana, it's all of that stuff is what it sounds like.\n\nPaige Costello (00:05:49):\nYeah, yeah. There's another group that's focused on our process management, but a lot of the core work in project management, core is in my group, and then we have a growth and enterprise scale team.\n\nLenny (00:06:01):\nYou've been at Asana for about four years now, right?\n\nPaige Costello (00:06:03):\nYes, four years this summer.\n\nLenny (00:06:04):\nCool. So something I'm always curious about companies that are at this scale is just the evolution they've gone through in terms of how they develop product, and so I'm curious, just in the time you've been there, how has the product development process at Asana changed, and maybe even simpler, what are some of the bigger changes that have been made to the way product is built at Asana over the years?\n\nPaige Costello (00:06:26):\nI would talk a little bit about how we set strategy and our planning process, and how that's changed in this time as well as how we actually ship product has changed in this time. On the planning front, we have really changed what altitudes we're planning at, the time horizon we're planning at. Some of the inputs have gotten a lot more precise and opinionated. So, for example, we have always had pillar plans and team plans, but maybe we didn't have an intermediary layer of an area perspective. Well, what's an area perspective? Well, as your organization grows, we've had to reorganize to create more agency and accountability close to teams that are focused on specific target customers and problems. So if you think about the way Asana is organized, we've got our R&D, the pillar structure, the areas within them, and then the working teams.\n\nLenny (00:07:23):\nIt might actually help if you even describe what is a pillar, what is an area in product development.\n\nPaige Costello (00:07:27):\nYeah. Absolutely. So when I said I'm responsible for that core product pillar, that's one pillar, but then there's also the adoption and enterprise scale pillar and the workflow pillar. Within each of those, there are subgroups, and we call those areas. Each of those areas has a very specific target customer and problem space they're solving for. We've often also dialed up the clarity of the metric at that level. So while we have an R&D set of metrics, we have pillar metrics, we have area metrics, and then at the team level, there's often one or two that they're really driving forward. So you can think of it as a nested structure around our product strategy as well as how we measure success.\n\n(00:08:14):\nWhen I joined, we didn't have areas. We were organized around projects and around locations, and then we worked to make sure that the thinking was more durable and problem-focused so that our roadmaps were not about features, but were instead about what was most meaningful to tackle for our business growth. So that's a big thing that has changed is the altitude of planning and how that nests. Another thing that has changed is the time horizon. So, before, we planned annually primarily. Now, we plan every six months, but for a rolling 12 months. So we have higher confidence in the immediate half, lower confidence in the following half, but we just plan every 12 months, every six months because it gives our business more confidence in what's coming and a better opportunity to align our go-to-market and product planning.\n\nLenny (00:09:10):\nAmazing. So I just actually was talking to one of the heads of product at Shopify, and they went through a similar transition where they used to plan yearly, and now they plan for the next six months. So it's interesting that I'm hearing this more and more, and you're saying that every six months, you revisit the plan for the next year. So it's an interesting hybrid of those two.\n\nPaige Costello (00:09:30):\nYeah. Absolutely. I think the more you try to do things in a joined up way where you have a single target customer with sales and marketing, and you want to make sure that the impact of your releases hit their mark, the more it's important to reflect on it frequently and to be able to pivot quickly because our strategy, even when we think we have a two-year vision, something will",

I think the more you try to do things in a joined up way where you have a single target customer with sales and marketing, and you want to make sure that the impact of your releases hit their mark, the more it's important to reflect on it frequently and to be able to pivot quickly because our strategy, even when we think we have a two-year vision, something will change, and then we say, \"Wow, we made so much faster progress on this than we thought, and we actually believe that there's a new opportunity or a new technology that we should be leveraging. Let's go bigger on that.\" So it reduces the feeling of churn and thrash. It makes us all more principled, and it helps us just make sure we're making the best use of our teams.\n\nLenny (00:10:20):\nI like that it also admits you're not going to actually have a yearly plan, like everyone plans for year, and then halfway through, they're like, \"No. Let's start rethinking everything again.\"\n\nPaige Costello (00:10:30):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:10:30):\nSo I like that you're upfront about that.\n\nPaige Costello (00:10:30):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:10:31):\nOkay, and then within the plan, do you have quarterly plans and sprints? Is there anything more fine-grained with a detailed roadmap just while we're on the topic?\n\nPaige Costello (00:10:38):\nYeah, not really. I mean, teams know approximately when are they expecting to do the work, but if you ask too much for a particular quarter, a particular week, or date, you will make strange choices about scope. So, really, we align on what success looks like, and the teams do their best job to ship as quickly as possibly, as iteratively as possibly, and we really encourage prototyping. So we added into our product process a notion that we might pivot or cut from stuff that we put on our roadmap because it felt like once it was on the roadmap, it had to be done, and that's just not smart.\n\nLenny (00:11:20):\nGot it. So, essentially, there's a six-month roughly detailed plan of what each team is going to work on?\n\nPaige Costello (00:11:25):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:11:25):\nGot it. Interesting.\n\nPaige Costello (00:11:26):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:11:26):\nMaybe just a couple more things just to make them super concrete for folks that might be listening. What's an example of an area? What's an actual team that would be an area? Then, the other question I have just while I'm saying questions is, are there some metrics you could share of just what some of these teams might be gold on just as examples of how you think about metrics?\n\nPaige Costello (00:11:45):\nThe area that came to mind when you asked about one of our areas is something called Coordinate, and their job is effectively making sure that the slice of Asana that helps teams work together is working effectively. So that's projects, and tasks, and the data that you might put into tasks, and all of the back and forth that is required when people use Asana for their core working team. Some of the metrics that they care about are like org paying weekly active users as well as really thinking about healthy project use. So we make sure that we understand what does good look like and what is a dynamic that we want to be creating in terms of people getting real value from using the product, and we build that into our metrics to have as a guardrail to ensure that we're not driving one metric at the expense of people really getting what they need out of Asana.\n\nLenny (00:12:41):\nJust a couple more questions along these lines.\n\nPaige Costello (00:12:44):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:12:44):\nI'm nerd-sniped about process.\n\nPaige Costello (00:12:46):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:12:46):\nI think you use a process called the Double Diamond Process at Asana. Okay. Cool.\n\nPaige Costello (00:12:49):\nWe do.\n\nLenny (00:12:50):\nI've seen images of this in various places, but I don't know of any company that's actually using it as the process. Can you just describe what the Double Diamond Process is and how you use it?\n\nPaige Costello (00:13:00):\nSo you might be familiar with lean startup concepts and Double Diamond as it relates to going broad, and then going narrow. So you go broad when you ask like, \"What customer should I solve for?\" and then you pick one, and then that's the narrowing. Then, you go broad, and you say, \"What are the problems this customer has?\" and you narrow, and you say, \"This is the problem they have.\" Then, you go broad, and you say, \"What solution should we do to this?\" and then you go narrow, and you say, \"This is the solution that we should start with.\" That process of going broad, and going narrow, and going broad, and going narrow forces people to get out of their opinion-driven lens because so often, we need to be curious quantitatively and qualitatively about what we're doing and why, and be more systematic and rigorous about getting there. It doesn't take long, but it just breaks the frame.\n\n(00:13:56):\nThe Double Diamond Process that Asana effectively... Each of our typical reviews or artifacts sit at different inflection points",

It doesn't take long, but it just breaks the frame.\n\n(00:13:56):\nThe Double Diamond Process that Asana effectively... Each of our typical reviews or artifacts sit at different inflection points on the Double Diamond. So we actually ask people to do a kickoff where they collect different information at different scale depending on the size of the problem and the ambiguity they're solving. Some people have already done enough customer selection and research that they're starting with, \"What are the possible solutions to this problem?\" and then they're bringing the spec, and that's the narrowing alongside design, et cetera. But it's really mapping our artifacts against this notion to make sure that the product thinking has that quality of decision-making. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:14:44):\nThe way you described it is it was very customer-target-oriented. Is that that the actual framework? Is it around who to build this for, and then what to build, or is it more... It is. Okay. You're not ahead?\n\nPaige Costello (00:14:44):\nIt is. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:14:44):\nOkay.\n\nPaige Costello (00:14:56):\nIt's really important because then you also know what success looks like because if you pick your success metrics as using a feature, that's it. You're teaching to the test. It's not actually driving the outcome. So while our planning process is around effectively defining category and how we win, and making sure that customers receive certain benefits from using work management, the through line to the individual project that a team might be leading is they need to know who they're solving for and what it means to have that problem solved. So it always starts with enough customer insight such that we can creatively do what they're trying to do. I mean, really inventing on behalf of customers.\n\nLenny (00:15:44):\nCan you maybe repeat if there's terms for each of those phases?\n\nPaige Costello (00:15:49):\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\nLenny (00:15:49):\nThen, is there an example of a feature or product that went through this that you could share? If nothing comes to mind, that's okay.\n\nPaige Costello (00:15:55):\nThe inflection points are the kickoff, which is that going broad, and then customer and direction selection. So this is both the target as well as of the 10,000-foot views of how you might pursue solving this problem. Which path are you broadly going to take? Then, going broad within that path on different concepts, and then there's a design concept review. Then, the products spec. Then, the full experience review or design crit of the end-to-end experience and launch. So that launch review is often just, \"Hey, here's the thing. Here's what we said. Here are the fast-follows.\" Most of the time, by that time, it's already been dogfooding internally for some time, and it's more of a formal, \"Do we have the right metrics in place? Are we ready to ship?\"\n\nLenny (00:16:52):\nAwesome. Do these reviews happen in person, on Zoom, or asynchronous?\n\nPaige Costello (00:16:56):\nIt depends. So it depends on the complexity of the work, and it depends how much we want to talk about it. A lot of our crits happen in person on the design side. A lot of spec reviews are more asynchronous, and then we'll say, \"Depending on the number of questions people have, we call a meeting.\" Otherwise, we do mostly async, but it's a mix. It really depends on the complexity and ambiguity of the solution and how much people have questions about asynchronously beforehand.\n\nLenny (00:17:27):\nI'm going to take a tangent with my questions here and talk about work from home policy at Asana. This is something that I've been wondering more and more about how it's changing because it feels like there's been a shift back to the office. So what is the current policy at Asana, and what's changed maybe over the past couple years?\n\nPaige Costello (00:17:42):\nWell, we were fully remote during the pandemic, and then we came back to the office in an office-centric hybrid format. So we're in the office Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and then work from home mostly on Wednesdays and Fridays. That dynamic has been designed from the start. We wanted to make sure that we took advantage of what's great about working together as teams, and so it's been the standard. So I would say what's unique about maybe Asana is we knew we would do that from the very beginning instead of hemming and hawing about would we be a remote workplace or not, and what would that mean, and how would we come together, and how would we budget for it. We're like, \"No, this is going to be an office-centric hybrid,\" because we wanted to create spaces for people to work together and move quickly.\n\n(00:18:37):\nIt's been interesting watching people get back into the swing of things. Even though we knew, it didn't mean that on day one, people were great at being in the office. People were taking standups sitting down. Whereas before, you would walk through our office, and you could hear people at standup because there were standup chants, and people would be out on the floor. Now, people are more likely to do their standup in a room, and we're trying the next level of standing up during a standup, but it's... I'm sure it's a",

Now, people are more likely to do their standup in a room, and we're trying the next level of standing up during a standup, but it's... I'm sure it's a shared experience for other people who are working in offices to get used to using the whiteboards again, to get used to standing up during your meetings. It's bizarre that we could lose a muscle that we had that was so innate so quickly, and I think even in the last month, I would say, and it's in June of 2023, there's more vibrancy in the office, more conversation, more casual... someone eating alone at the cafeteria, and someone sitting down next to them. So it didn't happen overnight.\n\nLenny (00:19:45):\nI've been seeing a lot of tweets of founders just being like, \"Work from home has failed. It's time to go back at the office.\" I'm curious if that ends up rolling into more and more companies, or if it's just a few founders here and there.\n\nPaige Costello (00:19:56):\nI think it's a real thing for mental health. I do think that having social casual relationships as well as more opportunities to talk strategy with people you're not forced into a meeting room with has been super beneficial. I can say that just today, I was having lunch and sat down with my head of data science, and we had an impromptu chat about how we review our experiments and how to evaluate whether we had ROI on learning, not just the metrics. It was one of those things where if we had to schedule it, it might not have happened, and if it did happen, it would have been a couple weeks from now.\n\nLenny (00:20:36):\nIt feels like just coming into the office once or twice... or sorry, being at home once or twice a week is not that different from how things used to be where there was a day of no meetings and a lot of people stayed from home. So it feels like it's almost reverting back to that.\n\nPaige Costello (00:20:47):\nExactly, and people are better at it than they used to be.\n\nLenny (00:20:47):\nRight.\n\nPaige Costello (00:20:50):\nSo I would say our remote days are more impactful than the days we're together where we're getting into the swing of things.\n\nLenny (00:20:56):\nYeah. I feel like as a PM, the only day I was productive and getting real deep work done was the No-Meeting Wednesday. It was at Airbnb.\n\nPaige Costello (00:21:04):\nYes. I would encourage you to know your chronotype and to lock that time where you have the most head space to do that work. So, for me, it's mornings.\n\nLenny (00:21:12):\nSay more on chronotype. What is that?\n\nPaige Costello (00:21:15):\nI'm a morning person, and so I try to make sure that I don't have any meetings before 10:00, sometimes before 11:00, and that's when I do my hardest task for the day.\n\nLenny (00:21:26):\nI also just thought about standups while I was at Airbnb and how not only how much energy they brought, but almost too much energy sometimes where there's like another team doing a standup, and they're just laughing and clapping, and we're just like, \"Shh, we're trying to work over here.\" I feel like we need more of that again.\n\nPaige Costello (00:21:42):\nTotally. Yep, yep.\n\nLenny (00:21:45):\nOkay. So, moving in a slightly different direction, something I heard about you is that you're often the youngest person in the room, and you often lead people with decades more experience than you. I want to ask, what have you learned about how to garner trust and win over skeptics, especially when they're maybe more experienced or older, and especially in other functions, I don't know, execs or designers, engineers, what have you figured out there?\n\nPaige Costello (00:22:13):\nThe thing I would say is bring the insight. Know thy customer. Know thy market. Know thy competitors. Know thy numbers. Know thy product. If you can be the person in the room who has watched customers use the product and has a point of view about why one tool is significantly better or worse in a given dimension, and you can do that with confidence and clarity, and you don't need to know the other person's functional domain, and you don't need the expertise in what they're experts at, you can bring insight that makes people curious, and trust you, and just immediately believe that there's an opportunity that you're not advocating for that just is true. But I think that's a really tricky and unique thing is not to pretend like you have more experience than you do, but to be willing to ask great questions, and then be curious enough that you're bringing insight to every meeting that people may or may not have, but you're always willing to share.\n\nLenny (00:23:21):\nThat's such a good answer because it's like there's not a trick to it. It's just do the work, spend the time to become the person that has answers that people value and obviously, that will respect you, value your opinion, want to hear from you.\n\nPaige Costello (00:23:34):\nYeah.

It's just do the work, spend the time to become the person that has answers that people value and obviously, that will respect you, value your opinion, want to hear from you.\n\nPaige Costello (00:23:34):\nYeah. Yeah. Our former board member, Anne Raimondi, and now our head of business wrote an article on First Round that was really great about the trust equation, and it really resonated with me. I don't know if you've heard about it, but she said that trust is equal to credibility plus reliability, plus authenticity, divided by or over perception of self-interest. I think when you're met by someone who doesn't know you, doesn't know your work, your job is to create credibility, and that's where I said bringing the insight is where you can really tip the scales here. Reliability, this is all about your say-do ratio. Authenticity is just being vulnerable, being yourself, and then making sure that people know that you're not in it for some other outcome or cause that perception of self-interest really can change whether people... how much they trust you.\n\nLenny (00:24:46):\nIn terms of knowing the insight and knowing thy customer, putting the time, I imagine, is a big element of that. Is that how you do that, or is there anything else along those lines that's just like, \"Here's how I get really good at this?\"\n\nPaige Costello (00:24:59):\nWhen you take a new role, become best friends with a researcher, and spend time watching customers use the product firsthand because what they maybe report on or are trying to do a study about might be very different from what you observe, but you really just need that front row seat with customers, and so asking, \"How do I actually set up time with customers? How do I compensate them? How do I read the tickets?\" Whatever. It's amazing how little you have to do to quickly catch up to understanding who the organization is solving for well and poorly, and how people really use your product versus how your teams use your product, especially in organizations where there are heavy dogfooding cultures. It's really risky to become less sensitive to the needs and behaviors of customers because people think they are their customer, and it also becomes very navel-gazey. So I think the more you get out and break up how people are having conversations about what we should do and why, and what we shouldn't do and why, and it's not about your opinion, it's about asking questions, and then bringing insight can really change the nature of the conversation and build trust.\n\nLenny (00:26:18):\nI love that. In terms of confidence, you talked about the importance of communicating these things confidently. Is there anything you've learned about how to be more confident? The managing part of it is like having the answer, but is there anything there that you maybe coach your PMs around or other folks of just like, \"Here's how you communicate confidence?\"\n\nPaige Costello (00:26:36):\nIt's a great question. I think being brave and courageous in little moments is just what you have to do. You have to show up, and say it before you're ready to say it, and ask for forgiveness, and be vulnerable. I think when you're vulnerable, people actually trust you more than if you come with all of this armor and say, \"I know this, and this is how we're going to do it.\" So real confidence is often conveyed by being willing to ask the question or to say, \"I don't know what you mean by that. Can you say that again?\" It's also just how you communicate, looking people in the eye, your body position, your body language.\n\n(00:27:22):\nSo much of this, I think people forget about because it's really easy to be in a meeting, and looking at your computer, and going through Slack messages. So one of the best things you can do is if you're in a meeting, be in that meeting. Continually scan the faces of everyone in the room, see if someone has a question, pause at the beginning, and welcome people, and chit-chat while people land, and then close asking questions like, \"Did I get all of that? Is there anything you would've expected to cover that we missed?\" It's really about being open, and that conveys confidence more than being assertive and advocating 100% of the time.\n\nLenny (00:28:03):\nThis episode is brought to you by Round.

One thing specifically that came up is that you're very big on leading and teaching by example, not just, \"Here's how you do this thing.\" So, if that's true, I'm curious where that came from for you and why you think that ends up being a lot more successful than like, \"In a meeting, you should do X, Y, Z,\" versus doing it, and then letting them see.\n\nPaige Costello (00:29:34):\nI think the main thing is repetition. We're all students of repetition. If you see something done a few times, you're more likely to remember it and internalize it, and so it's also something that... a way that I learn, and so I think that's probably part of it. I remember hearing about a framework called the three Es: experience, exposure, and education. I think it was helpful for me to hear that as a way of growing your career or being more purposeful about your growth because I think when people are earlier in their careers, they tend to think, \"Education, education, education,\" and then they started to think, \"Experience, experience. How do I get the experience of being a manager? I need to read about it, and then be a manager.\" It's very linear.\n\n(00:30:29):\nExposure was such an important one where I thought like, \"Okay. So you're not in the driver's seat, but you're in the car, and you hear what's happening, and you're evaluating how this is... what the impact is.\" This goes back to being really present and analytical, and being a learner because if you can be a learner, not just in an education or experience context, but in an exposure context, you can really grow so much more quickly and in so many more directions than you will get from just what does your day entail from what work is directly required of you.\n\nLenny (00:31:12):\nIs there an example of that happening either to you or you saw a manager leader do this, and you're like, \"Oh, I get it now,\" or you doing that and it helped?\n\nPaige Costello (00:31:18):\nSo I'll give two examples. I mean, the way I run my meetings are the kind of meetings I want to be a part of. So I try to make sure that I start with a clear agenda, and I move quickly, but give time for conversation and that it's not fully just sharing information, but debating where appropriate. I think knowing how to manage the conversation and courteously pausing people who are going on too long or taking the group in a different direction than was intended, and just think about the experience of everyone there, and create the experience that you hope that they're creating in the rooms that you're not a part of.\n\n(00:32:08):\nAn example that I have in terms of experience is sometimes the experience is you doing the thing and getting that experience firsthand. Other times, you need an education, you need a mentor, you need a coach who will tell you what they're saying or give you advice. I was in a really high-stakes product review at Intuit, and at the end of it, everyone else had left, and the leader of the business unit as she was leaving the room said, \"Always answer the question that they should have asked.\" \"Always answer the question they should have asked.\"\n\n(00:32:49):\nI was pretty surprised by that advice because it was very profound in the moment because I think when you're a student and you are accustomed... If you're an achiever, you like to get As. You're probably going to hear a question and answer it. You're like, \"One-to-one, one-to-one, one-to-one.\" But what I learned from that was that there's actually another altitude, another point of strategy when you're in a meeting or in a conversation to make sure that you're covering the more important point, the bigger picture, the alternative that the person asking the question maybe didn't see or consider. So I think the mix of experience, exposure, and education really helps you make sure that you're consciously moving forward on each of those fronts or finding people who can help you there.\n\nLenny (00:33:43):\nI love that piece of advice, and it makes me want to ask, are there other pieces of advice that have been really impactful to you, or are there common pieces of advice you give to your team that just is a recurring theme of advice that maybe people even make fun of like, \"Oh, Paige is always saying this?\"\n\nPaige Costello (00:33:59):\nThere are a few ways to think about advice, and my advice often meets some mark when it's for a particular person in a particular time in their career. So I would say advice I love giving to people who are early in their career is don't self-select because I think it's really easy to say, \"I don't have the experience,\" or, \"I'm not X, Y, Z enough,\" and not apply. So I really push people not to self-select, and I try to remind myself where that's appropriate to do the same thing. Other advice I often give is just think big, ship small. \"Think big, ship small.\" What's the smallest thing you can do to do that thing? But let's not, because we're trying to ship all the time and in small chunks, start thinking in small ways because it's really easy to get a",

But let's not, because we're trying to ship all the time and in small chunks, start thinking in small ways because it's really easy to get a little too incremental, a little too wrapped around the axle around optimizing a metric and miss the bigger picture, and so think big ship small is another piece of product advice I give.\n\n(00:35:02):\nThe last piece of advice that I would say that I like is more of a way of thinking. So this is a little abstract, but when employees join Asana, they get a book called The 15 Commitments of a Conscious Leader. It's led by the Conscious Leadership Group. They also get two-day training on some language and tools for how to effectively work with other people, and it's a really... For me at least, it was transformational because I learned some vocabulary and methods that I could share with my peers. One of the things that you learn is to be above or below the line, and something that is this concept of like, \"Where are you? Are you above the line? Are you below the line?\" If you're above the line, you're committed to learning. You're open and curious. Things are funny here, more playful. If you're below the line, you're committed to winning. You're committed to being right. Things are more black and white.\n\n(00:36:10):\nAll of us have days where we're having a conversation and we're really in that below line space where it's like, \"No, it just is this way. There's no two ways around it.\" That concept of understanding your personal head space, and then being mindful of how you're operating when you're in that place really was great advice for me and also recognizing where other people were when it related to decisions we were making or context. It also helped me think about rejecting false trade-offs and challenging like... Effectively, there's this notion of how might the opposite be true, and that's a piece of advice that I give myself like this morning.\n\n(00:36:55):\nI think it was yesterday, actually. I was like, \"How am I going to do tomorrow? Tomorrow, I have to deliver the clarity pillar brief to the area leads and make sure they understand our stack ranked metrics, and they need to know exactly what our strategic priorities are and why, and they need nudges, and they need to be able to translate our voice of business and usability lists into those plans. I need to establish a perspective and make sure this is all written down and they really understand it, and I have a great conversation with them where I get open questions and they feel like they can really challenge my thinking. I also am having a podcast with Lenny in the afternoon. Ugh.\" Right?\n\n(00:37:37):\nAt first, it was like, \"This is just too much. I should try to move or cancel one of these.\" Then, I asked myself, \"How might the opposite be true?\" I was like, \"I can do both.\" It was just enough to pop the balloon because sometimes your brain is so accustomed to having a scarcity mindset as opposed to creating alternative options or seeing a different path. The moment I challenged myself and said, \"How might the opposite be true?\" my shoulders dropped. I felt more relaxed. I was like, \"Oh, yeah, I can do both. It will be fine. We'll have a great conversation. I'm ready to show up, and be curious, and really engage with you on the topics that you've found interesting, and we'll just do that. So, \"How might the opposite be true?\" has been a really helpful piece of advice or line of questioning that I use with myself to make sure that I'm not taking myself away.\n\nLenny (00:38:43):\nWow. What a fruitful question that ended up being. That was amazing. How does clarity pillars strategy go? Are people into it? Is it working?\n\nPaige Costello (00:38:52):\nYeah. I'm pumped. It's a really interesting time to be a product leader, especially with all of the tech transform... Truly, the technological transformation on LLMs is astonishing, the pace of development, the ability of our teams to just ship quickly and ship really intelligent things. We're not in an operational \"figure it out\" land. We're not in a place where we're trying to decide how to do a better job and get it out to customers. We really have lots of interesting paths forward and are trying to make sure that we're on the cutting edge while really looking at like, \"What does it mean to serve the companies and organizations that we want to serve with new ways of serving them?\" So it was a really fun conversation, and I also had to be honest with people and say, \"This is a 70% cut. 30% of this is missing or incorrect, and that's why I'm coming to you early.\" So I think it went really well, and it's the start of our 12-month rolling planning conversation.\n\nLenny (00:40:05):\nLet me pull on this AI thread because it's clearly top of mind for a lot of people.\n\nPaige Costello (00:40:08):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:40:09):\nHow do you think about splitting up investment in AI exploration within the product team? Are you like, \"Hey, team. Everyone should be thinking about AI as part of their product,\" or is it there's a team where they're going to think about AI and LLM integrations and, \"Everyone else, keep doing",

Are you like, \"Hey, team. Everyone should be thinking about AI as part of their product,\" or is it there's a team where they're going to think about AI and LLM integrations and, \"Everyone else, keep doing what you're doing?\"\n\nPaige Costello (00:40:24):\nWe've had an ML team for quite some time, making sure that we have test prioritization models and notification prioritization models, and are making our product less work for people to use. But when it came to the massive leap forward in LLMs recently, we staffed a team to really prototype quickly, and discover what was possible, and just apply hypotheses outside of the typical norms of how we work. So they went straight to prototyping instead of going through that Double Diamond I was explaining earlier. What that meant was that we were really quickly able to say, \"Wow, this is just so much better than we imagined and would never have prioritized it because we thought it would take so much longer.\" Then, in other cases, \"That sounded good in theory.\"\n\n(00:41:18):\nSo skipping a lot of that to just really try it on for a size has been key, and then what we're doing is giving the teams with the most expertise in the customer problems. For example, status and progress reporting, the keys to that car and saying like, \"Here's the starter. Here's the hypothesis. Here's how far we got with it. It's dogfooding. What do you want to do?\" So we're able to nudge people without wasting time and build the skills locally within the teams that then move those experiences forward.\n\nLenny (00:41:50):\nI want to come back to the coaching topic. I had a few questions there that I moved off of, but I feel like that's a rich area of exploration. You mentioned Intuit. You worked at Intuit. Intuit is famous for having a really good APM program and really good training for product managers. What did you take away from that experience that you bring with you to coaching or even I think there's an APM program at Asana, too?\n\nPaige Costello (00:42:15):\nIntuit had excellent training programs, the APM program and their manager training. So, on the PM front, the biggest thing that they taught was around customer centricity, and it really started with the founding of the company. For anyone who works at Intuit or has worked at Intuit, they know that there's this story about Scott Cook watching his wife balancing her checkbook at the kitchen table, and staring at it, and saying, \"There's got to be a better way, a software.\" So it was very typical for the product training at Intuit to be all about like, \"How do you actually watch customers using your product or just doing the things they do, collecting the artifacts, knowing the workarounds, and using that experience to build opportunities for surprise and insight that then you can capitalize and create products around?\" They also are very specific about how they define durable advantage and think about, overall, the product process from a place of customer insight through to the market landscape. So the PM program there was absolutely super thoughtful, especially for taking someone who has never PMed into being a super skilled PM.\n\n(00:43:37):\nThey also have a wonderful manager training program, and I think the biggest thing that I took away from their manager training was really on the feedback slide. So delivering feedback is something that I think everyone benefits from, but for managers, it's so much more critical because if you don't do it, and you don't say what you mean, and you don't do it in a way that it can be internalized and acted upon, you really don't set up your teammates, your teams for growth or success in their careers. So their program for helping you think about like, \"Okay. I'm going to convey this feedback as situation, behavior, impact. The situation is on Tuesday in that meeting at 3:00. Behavior, you interrupted me while I was saying this thing. Impact, made me feel like you weren't listening to me or made me feel like your voice was more important than mine, or impact, blah, blah, blah.\"\n\n(00:44:35):\nIt doesn't matter what the impact is because the way you've set it up is it's a subjective observation. It's not what the camera recorded, it's what you experienced. Therefore, it is true and valuable feedback, and it gets the conversation started such that you can then talk about next steps. That format and framing really helped me understand that delivering feedback isn't about being right or about getting the right information to the other person. It's about sharing the impact of different decisions that they're making. So, especially if you have to give feedback about, God forbid, what someone wears to the office, or how do you feel their work is, or how they're communicating or their body language, having an enough support where you can be really clear about what you're intending and the spirit behind that, but that it's formalized enough that people can really engage with it has been enormously helpful, and I still use it today.\n\nLenny (00:45:35):\nIt's interesting how some of the most impactful training is such soft skills.\n\nPaige Costello (00:45:41):\nSo basic.\n\nLenny (00:45:43):\nBasic. Yeah.\n\nPaige Costello (00:45:43):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:45:44):\nIt's just how to give someone some feedback, but it's like, \"Know how to prioritize, how to do a",

Yeah.\n\nPaige Costello (00:45:43):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:45:44):\nIt's just how to give someone some feedback, but it's like, \"Know how to prioritize, how to do a meeting, how to give a presentation.\"\n\nPaige Costello (00:45:48):\nNo. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:45:50):\nIt's like, \"Here's how you give feedbacks.\"\n\nPaige Costello (00:45:52):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:45:53):\nSo you've worked with a lot of early product managers. I'm curious what you find most holds back new PMs and help them being successful in their career, and even on the flip side, what most helps new PMs be successful in terms of skills or behaviors, habits, things like that?\n\nPaige Costello (00:46:11):\nI would say this illusion that you have to be all-knowing and super confident sets you up to be in a place of advocacy instead of inquiry. So PMs who are newer in their careers or who are in a different space than they're accustomed to working really want to be pro really fast. What pro means is trying to cut that straight path, and that can reduce information and conversation that makes you smarter. So some of the challenges that some PMs face are feeling like they need to be the expert, they need to be the smartest person in the room, or God forbid, they think they're the smartest person in the room.\n\n(00:46:56):\nThen, what happens is they're really doing that customer, or product discovery, or spec in a little dark room. Then, they show up, and they say, \"This is it. This is right. I know it's right, and let's do this as quickly as possible.\" Everyone else says, \"Wait. What? I don't know. I have a question,\" or they don't, and they still have a question, which is even worse. So I would say something that really holds PMs back is not being collaborative from a place of true curiosity like performative collaboration where they're not in a room or want to do a review, but ultimately, they don't really want the questions or the feedback.\n\n(00:47:40):\nI think trying to make sure that you can be in a place of curiosity and openness because that will make your experience more successful is really important. Other people aren't always going to be right, but if you're present for it, you can ask clarifying questions. You can ask the question behind the question. You can hear the feedback, and then say, \"Was that something that I must do, that I should do, or that I should consider?\" You can actually develop a conversation that will move your relationship forward, and so I would say that's something that I think holds PMs back.\n\n(00:48:17):\nPMs tend to be so ambitious and career-centric. There are so many good things about that, but I would say don't let the sound of your wheels drive you crazy. If you're present in your job, and you actually have fun with it and solve the problems, people will come out of the woodwork, say, \"You're great, and tell your boss you should be promoted.\" You don't need to ask for a promotion. Your outcomes should speak for themselves. Yes, you should have sponsors and people who advocate for you, but a lot of that just comes from that raw connection to the work and to your team.\n\nLenny (00:48:55):\nEveryone I talked to about you is like, \"Oh my god, I love Paige.\" I could see why, but I want to ask you a question. I imagine you've made some mistakes either with a product or your career. I'd love to hear a story of something that went wrong and what you learned from that experience. This might be the last question, depending where you take it.\n\nPaige Costello (00:49:16):\nI would say that all of the advice I've given so far is directly related to things I've learned the hard way. So, especially as an IC moving into a management role, you aren't supposed to have all the answers. You need to ask better questions. You need to be thoughtful about direction and agency. So I would say one of the missteps here is knowing how to give guidance or direction in a way that doesn't feel like micromanagement because what you're trying to do is to teach a repeatable pattern instead of giving a precise instruction that can be used once, and then disposed of.\n\n(00:49:57):\nSo I think that's a pretty common manager path issue, but I think the faster you learn it, and observe it, and use techniques to manage it, the better. So, for example, I would go to my meetings with a stack of Post-Its, and I would write what I wish I was saying on Post-Its and see if someone else would say it first. Then, if by the end of the meeting, I had decided that I still had a Post-It or two that was worthwhile, I would say them. But you've got to police yourself because no one else will do it because no matter how accessible you think you are, other people know that you're the boss. They're not going to necessarily speak over you or challenge you directly.\n\n(00:50:42):\nAnother challenge I had is I'm a very optimistic person, and I like to look on the bright side. I'm very positive, and I think depending on the culture you're working with or depending on your team, sometimes they need to hear what's really",

I'm very positive, and I think depending on the culture you're working with or depending on your team, sometimes they need to hear what's really bad, and they need you to be really real, and they need you to tell them like it is. Something I realized was that I had an experience where I didn't realize that people didn't think I was being authentic because they thought something was bad, and I wasn't talking about it, but it wasn't because I didn't think it was bad or didn't see. It was just because my nature was to say, \"Well, I'm not going to talk about bad things because we're doing the things we need to do.\" As long as the plan is good, I wasn't really highlighting all the problems I saw or really pushing on those head on with my team, and so they felt like they didn't know what I was seeing or if we were saying the same things. That was really an interesting experience. Yeah, there were just so many. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:51:49):\nWith that second lesson, is there something you've changed in the way you lead and operate where you now found a way to communicate, \"Here's wrong,\" in a way that's still maybe optimistic and productive?\n\nPaige Costello (00:52:00):\nI try to be more real with myself and others. I try to show up and say like, \"Hey, this is incomplete.\" For example, even the thing I did this morning, the clarity brief. I said, \"This is 70% finish. The 30% that I don't believe is there yet are these three things. I don't feel confident in this piece of it, and hopefully, we'll have more clarity by next week.\" So that's an example of just being as real with the small things as with the big things so that people can balance their perspective of you and your work, and the organization and the environment you're creating.\n\nLenny (00:52:40):\nI'm curious how you think about your career going forward. How far out do you think where you want to be, and how do you plan out the future of Paige's career?\n\nPaige Costello (00:52:50):\nI try to be really intentional about staying as much as leaving a role. When I think about my career as a whole, I try to think about skills or experiences I want to have as opposed to roles, or companies, or specific problems. So something that I think about is... Effectively, I evaluate whether I'm in a healthy role and in a good setup by asking myself about my learning curve like, \"Is the steepness of my learning curve doing me a favor here?\" because sometimes you might love the organization, love the problem, and feel like you're just not learning, or learning fast enough, or being challenged.\n\n(00:53:39):\nThat's something that I think is really important. So thinking about the learning curve, thinking about whether the environment is positively impacting your ability to grow your career and make an impact. So, environmentally, you might have not enough staffing or tooling, or have someone in the management team who is toxic, or have a peer who is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That stuff matters, and I think people don't talk about it or take it seriously enough that your environment should include people who are advocating for you, and it should just be a place where you feel you've got the right ingredients to set you up to do the good work.\n\n(00:54:24):\nThen, the third piece is really around just the problem, the problem your product is solving. Is it fun? Is it interesting? I often like to think about passions are made, not found because I think people... We do this with nine-year-olds. We say, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" They look cross-eyed, and they say, \"An astronaut. Just getting a vet. I don't know.\" There's this moment of panic, and I would say that being comfortable, saying like, \"Go try different things, and see if the problem is interesting to you and if the problem is fun or interesting to you.\" It doesn't mean it has to be sexy. It doesn't mean the company needs to have a brand name. It just has to be something that you're curious about so that you do a better job at your job. So I would say learning curve environment and problem are things that I use to assess like, \"Am I still on the right path, or should I consider an alternative?\" But when I think about my own career, I really think about skills and experiences as opposed to roles. So I would say that that's more my frame of reference because otherwise, I think I am living in the future and not enough trying to make the most out of the career I'm living right now.\n\nLenny (00:55:44):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nPaige Costello (00:55:49):\nYeah. Let's do it.\n\nLenny (00:55:51):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nPaige Costello (00:55:54):\nMy go-to book recommendation for other PMs is inspired by Marty Cagan.

I'm just saying it's good. That's not spoiling.\n\nPaige Costello (00:56:39):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (00:56:45):\nOkay. Next question. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?\n\nPaige Costello (00:56:49):\nThe good news is I can tell you this and still keep asking it because the answer has always come up differently. So I like to ask, \"Tell me about a time something went wrong. What was it? What did you do about it? Yada, yada.\" Effectively, the question gets that, \"When the product failed,\" When something about the team didn't work,\" just things that go wrong because that's what happens when you're doing this work, and evaluating people's mindset, and the way they talk about it, and the way they relate to evaluating the situation. I think it's a great question. Really tells you a lot about how people think and how they perceive themselves when things are not working well.\n\nLenny (00:57:34):\nWhat is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love?\n\nPaige Costello (00:57:37):\nI've been playing a lot with Poe.com lately. Yeah, just an opportunity to learn more about LLM capabilities in a firsthand way. It's been fun to create little bots. I'm playing with making a page bot. I can't say that the page bot could have had this conversation yet, but maybe next year at this time, you can have a conversation with the other me.\n\nLenny (00:58:07):\nThat's what the page bot would say if this was the page bot talking right now.\n\nPaige Costello (00:58:10):\nI would say though that the advice, bits and bobs, I gave you earlier are absolutely things that I've been thinking about feeding, but I think the page bot would probably say, \"Ship it.\"\n\nLenny (00:58:25):\nPoe. It's the Quora founder's LLM chat bot?\n\nPaige Costello (00:58:30):\nYeah, and so you can try the different models. So you can do four, and you play five, and Claude, and a few others. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:58:38):\nThere's also a lennybot.com for folks that haven't seen this. Actually, there's a whole post on my newsletter of how it was built, and you get a lennybot.com. It is trained on all of my newsletter posts, and I think... not yet podcasts, but someday it will have podcasts.\n\nPaige Costello (00:58:55):\nOoh.\n\nLenny (00:58:55):\nBy the way, someone listening to this, we're looking for someone to maintain this bot and evolve it. So if you're really into this stuff and have done this sort of thing, please DM me on Twitter. I'm looking for someone to take over lennybot.com, make it more... Moving on. Enough about me. Next question. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to execute?\n\nPaige Costello (00:59:18):\nOne of the biggest ones is just, once again, being real about how many reviews and approvals it takes for something to get done and who's actually responsible for reviewing and approving work. So we got really aggressive about, functionally, who is in charge and at what level for a given review, and pushed to say to actually have limits on the number of people per meeting, on the number of sub-task reviews for a given body of work. What this did is it created a lot more agency and pace within given working teams. So what we did was we said, \"We actually don't care. We don't want a daisy chain of approvals. We just want one person with whom the buck can stop with them, and they can be responsible for how the work moves forward such that the knowledge is known and we could have connected the dots more effectively than we do or did.\" So that's the logic there, and it really changed the pace and quality of our work.\n\nLenny (01:00:25):\nI love that. Is there any more you could share, a number? What is the maximum? Is there anything that other people maybe can take as a-\n\nPaige Costello (01:00:31):\nYeah. So no more than three reviews on a given piece of work where people are blocking one approver. If a meeting has more than 10 people on it, we ask the person hosting the meeting to kick out the other people and write better decision notes.\n\nLenny (01:00:49):",

Informed people? Stakeholders?\n\nPaige Costello (01:01:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:01:06):\nDecision-makers? Okay. Great. Final question. You work at Asana. What is your favorite Asana pro tip?\n\nPaige Costello (01:01:12):\nI use Asana to run all my meetings and assign pre-reads. So I use the multi-assign feature in subtasks all the time where I make a task with a due date that says, \"Read this thing by this date,\" and then I assign it to a team or a set of individuals like that really quickly. Then, when I'm in the meeting, I take notes live in a task, and then highlight parts of those notes, and convert them into subtasks so that none of the action items get lost.\n\nLenny (01:01:46):\nWow. You need to make a video or blog post about this. Not only is it using Asana to build Asana, it's using Asana to run teams within Asana.\n\nPaige Costello (01:01:46):\nYeah. It definitely does that, but-\n\nLenny (01:01:57):\nAsana all the way down.\n\nPaige Costello (01:01:58):\nPeople know who's responsible for what they want.\n\nLenny (01:02:01):\nAmazing. Paige, you are awesome. Thank you so much for doing this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nPaige Costello (01:02:10):\nYou can find me on LinkedIn and Twitter, Paige Costello, and on Twitter, @paigenow. Listeners, well, I'd love to hear how you think AI is going to shape the future of software for knowledge workers, but in particular, if you and your team use Asana, I'd love to know where you'd like to see AI playing a bigger role to drive efficiency alignment for your team. So, as you know, we offer a ton of goal management, work management pieces that help teams and orgs do their work together, and I'd love to hear from you about where you see the opportunity.\n\nLenny (01:02:49):\nAwesome. Paige, again, thank you so much for being here.\n\nPaige Costello (01:02:53):\nMy pleasure. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (01:02:55):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:02:57):\nThank you so much for listening.

    "content": "Geoffrey Moore (00:00:00):\nThe tendency when you're in the chasm is, \"I just need more customers. I should take any customer I could find,\" because we need revenue. It's like taking a match and running it back and forth under a log. It's not going to light the log. So how do you start a fire? Well, you start it by putting a little kindling, little crumpled up paper, and you hold the match in one place until the fire starts. That's why adjacency is so important. If you light the fire, the piece of kindling is here, but the log is in the other room. That doesn't work.\n\nLenny (00:00:32):\nToday, my guest is Geoffrey Moore. Geoffrey is the author of maybe the most influential and important book on go-to-market ever written, Crossing the Chasm. Even though it's sold over a million copies, it still feels like people continue to reinvent many of the lessons that Geoffrey uncovered and shared in a seminal book. In our conversation, we discuss why it's so important to get very narrow with your initial audience, how the bowling pin strategy helps you get past early adopters, what the specific go-to-market playbook is for every stage of the adoption lifecycle, why using the wrong playbook during the wrong phase will slow you down. Also, the seven deadly sins of trying to cross the chasm incorrectly. Also, how to sell your product at different personas, why you don't need to focus on the problem and the pain when you're selling to early adopters, plus some real good life advice that I didn't expect.\n\n(00:01:22):\nGeoffrey has so much wisdom to share if you're building a B2B company, and I'm really excited to bring you this episode. With that, I bring you Geoffrey Moore after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:34):\nLet me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for, you probably find those little in-product pop-ups really annoying. Want to take a tour? Check out this new feature, and these pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say. They just want to close them as soon as possible, but every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day, and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone. CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product, growth, marketing, and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them.\n\n(00:02:08):\nThey use AI to get closer to user intent, so they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words, and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions. They do popups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps, and websites, and they work with industry leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar, you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny, and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/lenny.\n\n(00:02:56):\nThis episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features, and hundreds of other companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know, like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently launched AuthKit, a complete authentication and user management service. It's essentially a modern alternative to Auth0, but with better pricing and more flexible APIs.\n\n(00:03:38):\nAuthKit's design is stunning out of the box, and you can also fully customize it to fit your app's brand. It's an effortless experience from your first user all the way to your largest enterprise customer. Best of all, AuthKit is free for any developer up to 1 million users. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.\n\n(00:04:03):\nGeoffrey Moore, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:04:07):\nWell, it's nice to be here, Lenny, and thank you for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:09):\nIt's incredibly cool to have you on. You've been at the top of my wishlist of guests to have on this podcast ever since I launched it, so it's surreal to be chatting with you. It almost feels like maybe this podcast has crossed the chasm now that you're on.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:04:22):\nIf you'd called me earlier, I probably would've been on it with you. But anyway, we're together now.\n\nLenny (00:04:27):\nI thought it'd be fun to start with this question of just what frustrates you most about what people still don't get about the things that you teach, particularly Crossing the Chasm. You wrote that, I think, 33 years ago at this point. You have a lot of follow-up books around the topic. What do you think people still don't really understand or often get wrong?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:04:45):\nAll the books I write are about frameworks. They're conceptual models about",

What do you think people still don't really understand or often get wrong?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:04:45):\nAll the books I write are about frameworks. They're conceptual models about what patterns should you be looking for as something evolves? Because in disruptive innovation, there's no history. You're always projecting a possible history, and then seeing if you can make it come true. So that implies there's a lot of freedom to exercise the framework however you choose to. People sometimes do that in ways that are just... They actually end up being very misleading about what's possible. I can remember one person early on saying, \"Yeah, we're Crossing the Chasm. Our beachhead segments the Fortune 500,\" and you went, \"Well, I don't think maybe you're as clear on this as you could be.\"\n\n(00:05:32):\nTo be fair, that's what the function of any third party advisor is, is to say, \"Look, time out. You might be looking at this through an inside-out lens. Maybe you should be looking at it from an outside-in lens.\" That's probably number one. Gosh, after that, I'm just empathetic with the fact that their world's more important than my world, so I try to work with their world.\n\nLenny (00:05:59):\nThat's exactly where I actually wanted to go next is this idea of starting very focused with your initial target audience. I think people conceptually know this. They're like, \"Yeah, we should be really focused with our initial target market. We should stay very small, and expand this beachhead idea.\" But I think they still don't quite actually do this because it's like, \"Why not go wider?\" So could you just talk about why that is so important, and how to actually think about how to do that correctly?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:06:23):\nIf you're essentially in a business where the category is emerging, then the most important thing for you to do is to be able to create enough power around your company that you can navigate your future on your own power. Where does power come from in an early adopting technology world? First of all, it'll come from can you get a lighthouse customer? So one of the things we try to do even before you try to cross the chasm is can you get one or more customers who put you on the map? And they go, \"Whoa, did you know that the CIA used AWS?\" Like, \"Holy smoke.\" Okay, that's great. It doesn't make a company, but it makes a story, and it lets people know, \"Oh, here are the guys that did the CIA project,\" that kind of thing.\n\n(00:07:09):\nThe Crossing the Chasm model is, \"Can you create a viable repeatable business?\" And in order to do that, you need to have an ecosystem of partners work with you in order to consolidate your position. Well, why would an ecosystem work with some startup that nobody's ever heard of? The answer would be if you had consolidated a market segment where you were number one. So one of the things we've learned about company power is that basically it's the company power plus the ecosystem together. So ecosystems form around market leaders, and they do not form around the rest of us. If you're a category leader, if you're like Oracle and Databases, you're 40 years in. You're still the leader, because the ecosystem organized around you.\n\n(00:07:51):\nBut when you're little, the only way you can get an ecosystem to organize around you is to go after a segment where you're a big fish in that pond. We talk a lot about fish to pond ratio. You want to be... Your first pond, your target segment should be something that in the next two years, if you hit your really high growth rates, you could be 30, 40, 50% of the market share in that segment. That would cause partners to go, \"Whoa, if we're going to serve that segment, we got to work with these guys.\" So that's the key. The concept there is, \"Well, why wouldn't you also do two or three or four segments at the same time?\" It's sort of the same reason, \"Why wouldn't you run in three or four primaries at the same time if you want the presidential nomination?\" Although why you would want that nomination, I have no idea.\n\n(00:08:39):\nBut if you did, you realize if you're running in New Hampshire, votes in Vermont do not count. It's the same thing with Crossing the Chasm. You need to get three or four or five or six reputable companies in a segment to all pick you, for then the rest of the segment to go, \"Well, it's pretty obvious who the standard is.\" I'll just close with one last comment. And the reason, the mechanism behind all that logic, is that pragmatic people buy what they see their peers are buying. So if peer one is buying product A, and peer two is B and C and D, there's no market leader, and the category goes sideways. But if A, B and C, if three out of four people are using the iPhone, it's like, \"Oh, I guess I'm supposed to get an iPhone,\" that kind of thing.\n\nLenny (00:09:29):\nAwesome. I'm glad you went there, because that's essentially the root of this Crossing the Chasm idea that people after the chasm, the pragmatists, wait for references and social proof, and they're waiting for someone to tell them, \"",

I'm glad you went there, because that's essentially the root of this Crossing the Chasm idea that people after the chasm, the pragmatists, wait for references and social proof, and they're waiting for someone to tell them, \"This is worth using,\" versus visionaries right before the chasm. They're like, \"I just want to use the future. I need to be there before anyone else.\"\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:09:49):\nYou're right. One of the ways we try to capture that in a thought bubble is before the chasm, the customers you work with are people who say, \"We believe what you believe.\" So in other words, they're on the same side. After the chasm, they say, \"I'm not sure about that, but we need what you have.\" So transitioning from, \"We believe what you believe,\" which is how you sell to visionaries to, \"We need what you have,\" which is how you sell to pragmatists. That's the shift.\n\nLenny (00:10:17):\nLet's actually spend some more time there on what it is that each of these segments needs, and how you convince them to use it, because this is really useful. So in these pragmatists group, you're saying the pitch there is you have a pain. I will solve this pain, and it's important pain. I think people always assume that's the pitch. But interestingly, your point is earlier in the two segments and maybe share what those two are, they use your product for a different reason.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:10:41):\nIn fact, if there's a total in the model of the technology adoption lifecycle that we organize this all around, there's actually four, I call them, inflection points. The first one we call the early market. That's the one we were talking... That's the visionaries and the technology enthusiasts. They are as excited about you as you are. I mean, they want the demo. They want to see the vision. They're exciting. And the key to that market is to have an executive sponsor who has enough clout to essentially fund this thing, because there's no budget for you. So they've got to create the funding, and then drive the organization to go all the way to bright.\n\n(00:11:21):\nThey're not that many visionary customers, but there's always one or two. The reason why it's so important to work with a marquee customer then is you... Look, nobody's ever heard of you, and if they've never heard of your customer, I don't care how amazing the win is. Nobody's going to hear about it. So it's really important you did it with Apple, or you did it with Verizon, or you did it with Mercedes, somebody that people have heard. So that's number one, and that's a project model. Even if what you sell is a product, those early mark... Every one of them is kind of a snowflake. It needs a ton of special services. There's no ecosystem of partners to support you, so you throw a bunch of extra labor at it. You do whatever, because you got to make them successful. So you'll do whatever it takes.\n\n(00:12:13):\nOkay, very cool. Got my marquee client, not scalable business, I mean, obviously. So then the second one is the Crossing the Chasm playbook. That's the one that organizes around the problem. The good news is those customers are open to hearing from someone new, because they've already talked to everybody they already know, and the problem is still... It's not that it's unsolved. It's being solved in a crummy way and, by the way, in a deteriorating crummy way. So it's getting actually worse. So there's pressure for them to act. This is where you go from the project model to the solution model, and as a vendor, you over commit to their problem.\n\n(00:12:54):\nFrom the very beginning, you talk to them. They don't want to talk to you about you. They want to talk to you about them, and you need to ask them probing questions about them. Just like going to a doctor, you don't want the doctor to come and say, \"Hey, can I show you a movie of the operation I just did? I want to give you a demo. You mind if I give you a demo?\" It's like, \"No. What I would like to do is talk to you about this pain I have in my side.\" And then when the doctor asks you good questions about it, you go, \"Ah, this is a good doctor. I'm going to trust this.\" So that's the whole point about that. Again, that scales a lot more than a project business, but it only scales up to the limit of the target segment.\n\n(00:13:31):\nSo we had this bowling alley model of extending. You could go to a second segment, a third segment if it was adjacent. Adjacent means either it's the same customer with a different use case, or it's the same use case in a different customer base, because the one case, you use your customer references. The other case, you use your partners, because the partners who built the one use case will say, \"Well, we got another segment that we work with. Let's bring you into that segment too.\" So that can take a company from, I don't know, tens of millions of dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars in the bowling alley. And in specialized industries like computer-rated design or things like that, you can actually go to a billion dollars or higher.\n\n(",

And in specialized industries like computer-rated design or things like that, you can actually go to a billion dollars or higher.\n\n(00:14:13):\nBut with most other categories, at some point, you have this third inflection point, which is it's when people go, \"Well, wait a minute, wifi isn't just for financial analysts, or isn't just for... Wifi is for everybody.\" So instead of saying, \"We believe what you believe,\" which we're not there anymore. And these people aren't even really saying, \"We need what you have.\" What they're saying is, \"We want what they have. This is really cool. I want what they have,\" and that creates what we call the tornado. That's when people... This is when you do want sales coverage, and you do want to go broad, and you do want to have a standard product. Basically, you want to capture as much market share as you can. There's a whole playbook around doing that, which was in a book called Inside the Tornado.\n\n(00:15:02):\nAnd then the last one, which is actually becoming much more important in this century is called Main Street, but Main Street where products have become commoditized, services become the new place of innovation. We've had taxis for 100 years, but Uber is an incredibly valuable thing. You convert the product to the service, and how do you revolutionize services? That's a situation where now people are saying, \"Look, I don't want to own the product. I don't want to own it.\" Well, kids, \"I don't want to own a car. I just want to call Uber. It's convenient.\" So anyway, those are the four models, and Crossing the Chasm was about that second one.\n\nLenny (00:15:45):\nAmazing. You touched on so many things that I want to talk about. I definitely want to dive into the bowling alley metaphor and strategy there. But to close the loop on this target audience to start with initially. First of all, you have this awesome bonfire analogy that I think might be useful to share. Then along that, is there any example or an example or two you could share of just someone that did that really well of picking a really good initial target?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:16:08):\nSure. Well, the bonfire analogy is just the tendency when you're in the chasm is, \"I just need more customers. I should take any customer I could find.\" Because we need revenue, but the analogy I have is it's like taking a match, and running it back and forth under a log. It's not going to light the log. So how do you start a fire? Well, you start it by putting a little kindling, a little crumpled up paper, and you hold the match one place until the fire starts. Then you want to build... The bowling alley metaphor is a little bit about, first of all, how could you win your first segment, but then increasingly, how would you go forward to win it? That's why adjacency is so important. If you like the fire and the piece of kindling is here, but the log is in the other room, that doesn't work. So I think those are the key ideas.\n\n(00:16:59):\nThere's a lot of people that have made Crossing the Chasm successful. The one that we wrote about first was this company called Documentum, and it's a good example. So it was a document management database back in the day that was not... that nobody had any, \"Why would you need this?\" It started with the pharmaceutical industry, because pharma said, \"Well, new drug approvals are 500,000 page documents, and they really, really, really are hard to manage, and we're screwing it up. And every day we screw it up, we lose a day of patent life of our drug, and the day of patent life's worth about a million or $2 million a day. This is a bad situation. We need to do something.\"\n\n(00:17:37):\nSo \"Okay, pharma, you got pharma.\" Great. Well, then what happened was the guys in petrochemicals said, \"Well, we're in the chemical industry. We're not in the pharmaceutical industry, but we have these standard operating manuals, and we have all these regulatory demands on us too. Not quite like the FDA, but this looks like this could be pretty useful to us too.\" And then after the petrochemicals guys got... Well, the chemical guys got it, then the petrochemical guys got it. Of course, they're oil and gas, and they say, \"Well, in addition, we have all these leases. The lease holds them. It's brilliant. This property is critical to our future plan, so we need a document database for the leases.\"\n\n(00:18:20):\nSo the guys on Wall Street who are financing these guys are going, \"Well, wait a minute. Hell, I mean, we're paper from wall to wall here. Why don't we...\" So what happens is you have this thing of this expansion, but in each case, it was into a new segment, but the use cases were close enough.\n\nLenny (00:18:36):\nSo if a startup founder is listening and trying to decide is their initial target audience, their ICP too wide, do you have any advice for how to know if this is still too wide, and you should try to get more and more",

I know you talk about a single use case. What else should people be thinking about there?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:18:53):\nWell, so first of all, before you try to cross the chasm, do you have a marquee? Have you won a marquee customer that puts you on the map? Because if you're not... You need to make yourself visible before you can make the Crossing the Chasm play. Let's assume you've done that. So then when we first saw, \"Well, why don't I just use that industry?\" Turns out that the visionary person you work with... First of all, they did some very weird things because they're visionaries and second of all, they don't want to help their industry. The whole point of this was they wanted to get ahead of their competitors. They didn't want to help. So normally you can't use the visionary project as your beachhead. You'd love to from a point of view of reusing the work. You just can't. So then the question becomes, \"Okay, where am I going to go?\"\n\n(00:19:41):\nSo the key formula, and this is the formula... If there's one sort of takeaway from founders listening at this point, you want to have a target segment that is big enough to matter, small enough to lead and a good fit with your crown jewels. That's the formula. So big enough to matter means do I have enough room to double or... Often venture capitalists talk about a triple double followed by a double triple. So if you said, \"Okay, let's just, I'm going to make you a million dollars.\" Put that visionary, but just to give you a number. Okay, so a double triple would be I went from one to four and from four to 12, and then I did a triple double. So that would be 12 to 24, 24 to 48, 48 to 90. Okay, so how would you get from one to a hundred million dollars?\n\n(00:20:31):\nSo you want to have a segment that says that I could get to a hundred million dollars in a five year... That was a five-year window. So you say, \"Okay, but what it can't be is a billion dollar segment.\" Because if it's a billion dollar segment, you might be able to get there, but you would not be a big fish. So that's a fish to pond ratio thing. So you want to think about, particularly as you're starting out... This is a B2B model predominantly. If I could take the top 20 customers in this segment, meaning... What do I mean by a segment? It's in the same geography. People in Japan don't talk to people in America. People in America don't talk to people in Germany, they even speak different languages. I don't know why everybody doesn't speak English, but apparently they don't. So they have to be same geography, same industry, because dentists do not talk to software designers, who don't talk to advertising people and in the same profession.\n\n(00:21:23):\nSo salespeople don't talk to finance people and finance people don't talk to the guys in the warehouse. So same industry, same geography, same profession. And then the compelling use case, which is the thing... That's the thing that starts the fire. There's segments everywhere and by the way, they all have that... They all do... Every segment works the same way. If I have to make a high risk buying decision, I'm going to talk to my peers about it. And I don't want to be first. I want to be able to do whatever the herd's doing. But what a compelling reason to buy does is it goes well, but I have to act faster than I want to. And that's what you need as an entrepreneur. You need the customer to be coming toward you even though you're new and you're unproven, and frankly you scare the crap out of them, but they're even more afraid of the problem that they're saddled with. So that's why you can build a relationship with them.\n\nLenny (00:22:19):\nAmazing. And this phase comes... You kind of imply it comes after, say you're at a million dollars AR, you don't do this sort of work of trying to cross the chasm at that point, until you reach something like that?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:22:31):\nI'm not sure AR is going to be the right reference. Here's what you need. You need a major account who's gone all in with you on the new technology and who is willing in some way to talk about it. The good news about visionaries is they tend to have fairly big egos and they tend to like to talk, unlike pragmatists who will not want to talk. Pragmatists, they'll have to go to legal and get permission and blah, blah, blah. But once you've got that, whatever your revenue is at that point, you should be starting to think about, \"Well, what is my beachhead segment?\" And the good news about Crossing the Chasm, it's not expensive.\n\n(00:23:12):\nThink about it, once you've said, I'm going to stay in one geography, in one industry, one profession, think about your marketing budget. You're not buying Super Bowl ads here. There's no sock puppets. That's not what we're doing. We",

You're not buying Super Bowl ads here. There's no sock puppets. That's not what we're doing. We want to get to maybe 200 people with a message. And then do you have the domain expertise to really understand the problem? And if it's a really compelling problem, they'll take the meeting and getting that meeting is... Because if you're an entrepreneurial founder, you're probably fairly charismatic. First of all, you've convinced your spouse that you're willing to work for no money with no benefits, and maybe you pitched a venture capitalist and you fooled them, so why can't you fool these guys? Anyway, that would be the way I would go.\n\nLenny (00:24:02):\nEssentially, the advice here is if you're a new early stage startup, one of the biggest milestones you want to aim for is a big marquee customer. When I think about this and look at a startup deck, if I see something like Figma is using this product or notion or Salesforce. Clearly, I'll be like, \"Wow, okay, these really sophisticated people decided this was useful to them.\" And so I will innately trust that. There's also often advice of don't work with big companies because they'll push you around, they'll take a long time, they'll force you to build a thing just for them and it won't apply to other people. What's your advice to avoid that downside?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:24:37):\nIt has to do with the persona of the executive sponsor. Nine out of 10 executive sponsors are going to be the negative because they're going to be a company person working with company processes. They're going to send you to purchasing, nobody's going to be happy. You're looking for the 10th one. The 10th one is one who says, \"I'm so tired of the status quo. I'm looking for people that are visionary like me. I like talking to you better than I like talking to my peers because you're different and I want to be different. I want to leapfrog the world, and these people just want to stay on the escalator. So they're staying on the escalator. God bless them, but I want to jump over the top.\" So it's a persona based choice is the key thing there.\n\nLenny (00:25:20):\nThat is really interesting. And then say that you are an early stage startup again, how soon do you think it makes sense to invest in finding that big marquee customer versus finding some smaller... I imagine you start with some startups to see how people... You don't go straight there.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:25:36):\nYes, and so initially, I think... And of course you and I are both playing, let's be clear, we're playing a software game. For example, I was trying to apply this framework to Intel, and Intel said to me, \"Geoffrey, you do understand that a prototype product in our industry costs about $500 million.\" Okay, okay, okay, okay. Maybe that's not the same model. I think in our world right now with digital transformation, most entrepreneurs are doing some software led play, which means you can work with a small team. So I think what I would advise is I would do projects. Even though I have a product vision, I would start with trying to make as much projects, which would be very customer led. And frankly, initially, even if I have a roadmap, the customer's probably going to take me off my roadmap a bit.\n\n(00:26:31):\nI'd have to be willing to say, \"I'm going to open the aperture enough.\" Because I just need to get enough experience with the technology. I need to put in people's hands. If it's a freemium play, you can do it for free. But that tends to be more of a consumer play. There are exceptions. There are B2B companies like Atlassian and things that did start as a freemium play, but that's not as normal. I would think more of the consultative play to do that. But what I would try to do, so I would try to get to cashflow break even on my own money with no venture capital. The only reason you need venture capital is if... Well, two things. Either A, the technology is too expensive and you cannot self-fund it, GPUs a bunch of that, training large language modules, those kinds of things. Or this thing is going to catch fire too soon and I don't have time to dither around for two or three years. So those are two reasons to go to venture capital, but just because you want to do a startup doesn't mean you need venture capital.\n\nLenny (00:27:35):\nWe had Jason Fried on recently the CO of Basecamp, and he made that point in many different ways. The benefits of not raising and how most VC funded companies do not work out, and even though they do, you often don't make as much as you could if you tried it to bootstrap it. So I think there's a lot of resonance there. And you have this quote that essentially kind of what you just said, that with a single round of funding, you should be able to cross the chasm and dominate a single use case in a single market within 18 to 24 months.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:28:03):\nYeah. This is like an English major doing math, so be careful because I am an English major. But in general, because again, I said it's not",

This is like an English major doing math, so be careful because I am an English major. But in general, because again, I said it's not expensive, and by the way, you're not discounting. In other words, you're actually using value pricing because the problem you're solving is severe enough, the customer doesn't want a discount, the customer wants you to... It is like if you have to have heart surgery, you don't want a coupon that says, \"Heart surgery 9.99 this Saturday only.\" You want to go to the Mayo Clinic or you want to go to wherever, so you don't have to discount.\n\n(00:28:44):\nWhat you do have to do is you have to make almost like a guaranteed commitment to the problem to solve. We're going to take this problem off the table and we're not leaving until you're satisfied. That's the key to the game. That's a little bit weird because if you've invented ChatGPT, and now you're saying, \"But I am going to solve the third grade math problem,\" which is a real problem. But ChatGPT can do anything. I know, but we're going to solve the third grade math problem. That's hard for a lot of entrepreneurs to get their head around.\n\nLenny (00:29:23):\nIt reminds me of the way Figma started, even though it took them a long time to find product market fit and started scaling, they ended up working very closely with Coda. I don't know if you know the story where they just wanted to make sure the Coda team, and it was called Krypton back then was very happy with Figma. So they went to the office, they set them all up, they started using Figma. And then on the drive home they called him like, \"It doesn't work anymore. Something's broken.\" And they were already home. And Dylan basically, and this team drove all the way back, I think it was an hour or two, and got there and turned out the Wi-Fi was down and there was some internet issue and fixed it and just was obsessed with making sure they were using it. And they're also just fixing the most ridiculous bugs that were not important because they just wanted to make sure they were really happy with it.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:30:11):\n[inaudible 00:30:11] a larger company would say, \"Look, we'll put you in our queue and you'll be on our... We'll get to you.\" I think this is... And by the way, this is part of the fun, frankly, of being in a startup because you're so close to the action, because there's nothing between you and the action. So why wouldn't you do that?\n\nLenny (00:30:29):\nYeah, and I think one of the takeaways I've had for my own research into this is that you need to find one company that just loves you. It's not like \"[inaudible 00:30:37], this is cool.\" It's like, \"I love this product. I would never want to give it up.\"\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:30:40):\nThat's kind of what I meant by that marquee ref... We sometimes we call it a radiating reference. It's just somebody really, we talk about you when you're not even in the room. Yeah, very cool.\n\nLenny (00:30:52):\nWe've talked about this idea of the chasm and Crossing the Chasm, but it might be helpful just to explain what is the idea, what is this chasm? What is it that people fall into and why is this important?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:31:01):\nAnd this was funny, because I was working at Regis McKenna, which was this marketing agency that was sort of the premier high-tech marketing agency in the eighties. And we had all these really successful launches, and then covers of front page articles on Fortune magazine and Wall Street Journal. And then a couple of years later it's like, \"Well, what happened to these guys?\" So that's where the chasm was like... That's what caused the investigation. What we learned was visionaries make their own buying decisions, and they do not consult their peers. In fact, if their peers are doing it, they're probably not going to do it because they want to be different. So basically these companies were having success capturing the imagination of the visionary, and they thought, \"Well, I'll use the visionaries as a reference to get the pragmatist.\"\n\n(00:31:53):\nThe pragmatist looks at the visionary and goes, \"That's not my guy. First of all, he thinks I'm dumb. He thinks he's smarter than I am. Second of all, he does stuff that I would never do, and he makes decisions in a way that I would never make them. So that's not... No. So but I am interested in talking to my peers, but the problem now is, well, which of the peers are going to go first?\" And it was kind of like the junior high dance problem. How do you get the party started? So that was the chasm. That was what created the chasm. The pragmatists need references and they will not accept a visionary as a reference, and they don't have any peers that have tried it yet. So that was what was happening.\n\nLenny (00:32:35):\nI think that's such an important point that I think people don't quite always get that that reference, marques customer needs to be",

So that was what was happening.\n\nLenny (00:32:35):\nI think that's such an important point that I think people don't quite always get that that reference, marques customer needs to be a pragmatist. It can't be one of these early adopters that are just trying stuff. And these other pragmatists need to feel that this is my person, this is just like me. And they love it.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:32:53):\nBy the way, one of the reasons that pragmatists have a certain... It's not contempt for visionaries, but it's definitely wariness, it's because often they have to clean up the messes that these guys leave behind because when you're a visionary, you leave a lot of messes in your wake. And then the pragmatist has to come in and clean it up. So they're going, \"Oh, that's another mark against these people.\"\n\nLenny (00:33:14):\nI saw a deck of yours where you actually represent each of these stages of the lifecycle and the visionary Steve Jobs is the way you represented it, and the pragmatists are just like business people in suits sitting at a conference table.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:33:24):\nExactly. And there's six of them. And the key idea behind that is none of us... By the way, I don't think any of these people are a guru and they don't think I'm a guru. We're using the antelope strategy, it's a herd strategy. But at some point... And by the way, we do this all the time, every one of... Airbnb, I want to get an Airbnb in Portland. Have you ever stayed [inaudible 00:33:53]? Is this a good hotel? Is this a good restaurant? Is this a good dentist? Is this a good lawyer? That's how we do it.\n\nLenny (00:33:58):\nI think Uber and Airbnb is the best example of this in action where I would not ride in a random car, especially I think women were most like, \"I will never get into a car, into an Uber.\" This is insane until all of their friends are doing it. And then, \"Okay, let's give it a shot.\"\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:34:13):\nI guess it's okay, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:34:15):\nYeah. So essentially most people were pragmatists and I guess that makes sense. And pragmatists make up the biggest chunk for it.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:34:21):\nAnd by the way, you can be a visionary with some things, a pragmatist with other things, and a conservative with other things. So the way to really think about them is, what is my persona in relation to this decision?\n\nLenny (00:34:34):\nI love this example of the junior high dance problem where nobody wants to go ask the person. It's like, \"I'm going to wait for them to come to me. I want to see how this plays out.\" It's such a good metaphor. In terms of how much of your product needs to be built at each of these stages. What advice do you share? How much do you need for these visionaries versus the next?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:34:52):\nSo with a visionary, you have to have the magic ingredient working. You don't have the whole product. And in fact, your product may be buggy, but it does something... Andy Grove used to call it the 10 x effect. You need to do something that is an order of magnitude better than anything because that's why the visionary is talking to you. They're going, \"Oh my gosh, you have this fusion.\" \"Fusion, really?\" \"Yeah, we got fusion energy.\" So that's number one. Then what would still cause you to not cross the chasm yet? If there's not enough product there, pragmatists cannot put up with a product that doesn't work. So you may need to do some additional work to say, \"Look, we get some more customers. I'm still living hand to mouth. It's mostly project work, but until the product has got enough stability and can be productized, I really can't afford to cross the chasm.\" So once you have a product that works, then you've got to say, \"Okay, now I've got to find a market where it can be the dominant solution.\" That's the time to cross the chasm.\n\nLenny (00:36:05):\nAnd a big part of that is obviously they have bosses, they have checklists, they have compliance people, they have IT people, they have people that need to buy into this or this meeting room with six people. They all have to be like, \"All right, this is the best choice.\"\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:36:18):\nAnd by the way, normally those people are designed to keep you out, and that decision process will take forever and you'll be in the welfare lines before they make their choice. So that's why it's so important to have what we call the compelling reason to buy. You need to have a group of people in a room where the leader, the guy who's going to actually sponsor make this decision is saying, \"Look, I already gave this problem to everybody in the room, and our answer sucks.\" He wouldn't say it that way, but that's the truth. And therefore, we're kind of at the... I mean, I'm getting the message. First of all, my boss's boss's boss knows",

You need to have a group of people in a room where the leader, the guy who's going to actually sponsor make this decision is saying, \"Look, I already gave this problem to everybody in the room, and our answer sucks.\" He wouldn't say it that way, but that's the truth. And therefore, we're kind of at the... I mean, I'm getting the message. First of all, my boss's boss's boss knows my name. That's a very bad thing. Secondly, I'm getting the message, you're either going to fix this problem, Geoffrey, or we're going to find somebody who can. So that's what gives them the energy to go against the inertial momentum of the decision-making process in their company.\n\nLenny (00:37:15):\nLet me tell you about a product called arcade. Arcade is an interactive demo platform that enables teams to create polished on-brand demos in minutes, telling the story of your product is hard, and customers want you to show them your product, not just talk about it or gate it. That's why product four teams such as Atlassian, Carta, and Retool use Arcade to tell better stories within their homepages, product change logs, emails, and documentation. But don't just take my word for it. Quantum Metric, the leading digital analytics platform created an interactive product tour our library to drive more prospects. With Arcade, they achieved a two x higher conversion rate for demos and saw five times more engagement than videos.\n\n(00:37:57):\nOn top of that, they built the demo 10 times faster than before. Creating a product demo has never been easier. With browser-based recording Arcade is the no-code solution for building personalized demos at scale. Arcade offers product customization options, designer approved editing tools and rich insights about how your viewers engage every step of the way. Ready to tell more engaging product stories that drive results? Head to arcade.software/lenny and get 50% off your first three months. That's arcade.software/lenny.\n\n(00:38:30):\nSo April Dunford was on this podcast and she has this book that she put out recently called Sales Pitch. And she make this point that buying software, SaaS software is harder than selling it these days because you can get fired for buying the wrong thing. It's so stressful. There's all these options. Your boss has to be happy with it. So often people end up just not going with anything. We're just going to keep what we have. It's fine, simpler, safer. Salesforce is fine. And it sounds like that's kind of what you're describing. It's so hard-\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:38:58):\nSo if you're a pragmatist, the first thing is if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Which makes you totally different than a visionary. A visionary's like, \"Yeah, no, come on, break it. Come on, let's move on.\" It ain't broke, don't fix it. If it is broke, who has fixed it? Is there fix in production? Does the fix work? I want that. In other words, basically to April's point, it is a risk reduction buying strategy. And by the way, you go as slowly as you can normally, but when you're under duress, you have to go faster. So the compelling reason to buy is putting you under duress.\n\nLenny (00:39:41):\nAre there any examples of these compelling reasons to buy that come to mind that give people a sense of here's a really good compelling reason to buy? I don't know if it's a pitch.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:39:48):\nWell, there's a ton. Well, how about ransomware? I mean, all of a sudden the cybersecurity thing is like holy smoke because it used to be, \"Well, they wouldn't attack my company. Or if they did, I mean, I have no assets.\" Yeah, well, actually... Because it used to be what they did is they would only attack companies that had data that they could resell in the dark web. Then God bless cryptocurrency, people are saying, \"Is it cross the chasm yet? Well, their first use case is criminals.\" It's not a very good use case, I'm sorry to say. But the point is, now ransomware with cryptocurrency can be a monetization, so that means everybody is vulnerable. So that's one kind of compelling reason to buy. But if you look around kids who are struggling with school, the parent has a compelling reason. Anything with healthcare, compelling reason to buy. Anything if you're in a legal problem, you have a compelling risk to buy.\n\n(00:40:48):\nSo I mean, there's always these situations where you say, \"Okay, that's on a personal basis.\" On a company-wide basis, it may be things like, \"Well, what am I supposed to do my office space? Can I get my company to come back to the office or do I have to dump the space? What am I supposed to do? And by the way, I know I'm going to have some kind of space, but do I want to design it the way we used? I'm getting into some space by the way, I got a great deal if it was a fire sale, right? Cool space, what do I put in it? Is it supposed to have offices? Do they have doors, do they not have doors do?\" So in other words, there's a bunch of stuff where you get people going, \"Okay, how can we help? How can we help?\" \"I need help. And I've gone to my standard solutions and no, I don't believe that, so I need help.\"\n\nLenny (00:41:37):\nOkay, so it's interesting that I even misunderstood what you're saying and I think this is a really important",

The compelling reason to buy is not a compelling reason to sell, which people often think about as the pitch you're making. The buy is basically the pain point. They need a really big pain.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:41:51):\nYeah, because that's what's going to... So therefore the key to the bowling alley that's different from the tornado, and it's also different from the early market. In the early market it's about you. You tell the story about you and the visionary wants to hear about you. In the tornado it's also about you, because we now have budget to buy this stuff, and you're a candidate. In the bowling alley, it's never about you. And that is so hard for a series of entrepreneurs because they want to give a demo, they want to tell the story, they want to share their vision. The answer is, \"We don't care. We don't want to hear your story. We hate demos, and I don't know who you are and I don't care. I'm in trouble. We need to talk about me. We don't want to talk about you.\"\n\n(00:42:35):\nSo we have this saying in the Crossing the Chasm playbook. First of all, \"Shut the God damn laptop. Just don't open it and start with...\" And the way you start the conversation is always the same. \"We're here because we've been working with some people in your industry and we understand there's this really serious problem around document management or around Wi-Fi access or whatever it is, and we believe that your company might have it, is that true?\" And what's interesting about it is you'll get one of two responses either, \"Oh, are you kidding me? Okay, we have that.\" Or often they'll say, \"Well, not exactly.\" And you go, \"Oh,\" but then before you can say anything else they'll say, \"What our real problem is...\" So people will talk about their... They want therapy, they'll talk about their problems. So if you're willing to... But as an entrepreneur, you got to realize the gold at this point is problem domain knowledge. That's the thing you really want to collect.\n\nLenny (00:43:45):\nAmazing. So you've sort of answered this question, but I want to make it even more complete. You have this amazing LinkedIn post of these four go-to-market playbooks based on the stage you're in. And you've touched on this already, but it might be helpful just to go through it one by one. And even more helpful would be like, what does it look like when you're in the early market? How do you know if you're in the early market versus in the bowling alley versus in the tornado?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:44:08):\nOkay, so in the early market, you know you're there because first of all, the story is the technology, and it's specifically the disruptive technology. By the way, you could start a business with a non-disruptive thing, but then you don't need these playbooks, then you're on Main Street. So the assumption is you've got something that nobody's ever done before or seen before. So in that playbook, the first thing is just you hear the responsibilities. And a venture capitalist would say the same thing to you. \"Do you have a technology expert who's a wizard? Because we're not going to fund just any two guys and a PowerPoint tech, even though we like your dog.\"\n\n(00:44:50):\nSo that's number one. Number two, \"Can you demo the technology?\" You have to be able to demo thing. And then three, \"Can you create a vision which says what forces are going to release?\" And the concept that we use in venture, I call it trapped value. And with the idea is where's the trap value that this innovation would release? Because when you release trapped value, the world will give you a portion of the gain, typically 10%. It's easy an number to do math with. As I said, I'm an English major. So if you want a billion-dollar company, you better find $10 billion worth of trapped value that your technology could- [inaudible 00:45:30]\n\nLenny (00:45:30):\nAirbnb is an amazing example of that, right? Where they unlocked people's homes, basically 10%-\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:45:36):\nYeah. Uber unlocked their backseat of the car. By the way, the free labor force, it was like, \"Whoa.\" Okay, so really cool idea early market fund. For the bowling alley one then the playbook is, \"No, where's the problem?\" And then you got to take it down to in what geography, what industry, what profession, what use case. And that takes... That's not just... I mean, you want to spend some time in doing that. And then what you want to really do is just maintain intellectual curiosity about the problem as opposed to jumping to the solution. So why is this a hard problem to do? What is going on? Where is the trapped value? By the way, how expensive? What is the cost of not solving this problem?\n\n(00:46:24):\nOften it's a risk exposure, or it could be just a gating item on your growth or potentially a churn problem. By the way, if you wanted",

What is the cost of not solving this problem?\n\n(00:46:24):\nOften it's a risk exposure, or it could be just a gating item on your growth or potentially a churn problem. By the way, if you wanted to pick a compelling reason to buy, how about if you help SaaS companies deal with churn? Do you think they would care about that? I think they might. So the point being... And you're going to say, \"Okay, I'm going to learn more about churn and I'm going to really understand... And by the way, I'm going to understand your churn,\" which is different maybe from somebody else's churn. So it's the problem domain thing. And then you build your go-to market around... The lead gen is, \"Hey, do you have any of these seven symptoms of fatal churn?\" And the people that respond to that ad are pre-qualified. And then the BDR, if you're at Salesforce, a BDR would call you and say, \"Just confirming you have these problems.\" \"Oh yeah, RBI.\" \"And your role at the company is... And are you responsible for doing this?\" \"Well, actually no, it's Harry, not Mary.\" \"Maybe we should talk to Harry.\" \"Yeah, you probably should talk to Harry.\"\n\n(00:47:32):\nThen you call Harry and you get the appointment with Harry because Harry's got the problem. And then the next thing is you do a diagnostic with them. \"So we understand we're talking to your colleagues, here's the problem, here's what we think we're doing. But before we tell you about how great our solution is, let's make sure that we understand what your challenges are.\" And your goal in that call is to get them to talk as much as possible and for you to take notes. And by the way, this is a place where you probably still want to remember to use a pen because you actually want them to see you writing down their words, because that means, \"Okay, he's listening. He's listening.\"\n\nLenny (00:48:14):\nOh, interesting. That's a good tip. Like on Zoom, would your advice there be just make sure the camera shows your hands?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:48:19):\nOh, yeah, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:48:22):\nOkay. Lean in. Yeah, yeah.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:48:23):\nOr sometimes... I mean, no, you couldn't do this. I was going to say we record it, but they don't want to record it because they're going to say some things during the call that they won't be necessarily complimentary to all their colleagues and they don't want you to record it.\n\nLenny (00:48:38):\nGot it. So in this bowling alley phase, how do you know you... I know it's not like this binary switch, but that you're ready to move into that versus the early market playbook.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:48:50):\nWell, I think you get to a point where you realize, \"I can't scale my business doing what I've been doing. I mean, I just can't.\" And if you've taken venture capital, the thing you want to do is, \"I don't want to have to raise another...\" Well, so understand how venture capital funding works for a second. This is important. A venture capitalist gives you money, and what they're buying from you with this money is, \"I want you to use this money to change the state of your company such that when we raise the next round, the next investor will value your company two to three times higher than we're valuing it today.\"\n\n(00:49:30):\nSo basically the purpose of this money is to change the value state of your company. If you do anything else with that money, you could have done brilliant things, created amazing demos, hired great people, but if at the end of the day you haven't changed the value state of the company and we have to raise more money, we're going to raise it at the old valuation and I as an investor lose, or even worse, we have a down round and I lose even more.\n\n(00:49:58):\nSo once you start thinking about that, so we're then Crossing the Chasm. The Crossing the Chasm play is I need to change the state of my company from a cool possibility to what accountants call a going concern. So what is a going concern? A going concern is a company that two years from now you would expect still to be in existence. Why would you do that? Because they have a customer base that's loyal and they have a ecosystem of partners that bring them into new deals and they have established their CAC and LTV, and they've kind of figured out their operating model. And it's not the biggest company in the world.\n\n(00:50:38):\nIt's somewhere we're now probably in the 10, $20 million, but it's a real company. It's a real company. And that's who you're trying to create when you cross the chasm. And you know you've crossed the chasm when you say, \"I don't have to raise any more venture capital. Now, I may want to because I have ambitions to be globally dominant.\" But you get to raise it on your nickel and on your timeline, not on, \"Oh my God, I'm running out of money.\" So the sooner you can get off with the, \"I'm running out...\" And particularly last year was fatal to a huge number of companies because that was not how they were thinking about raising funds. They always thought, \"Well, there'll be another",

They always thought, \"Well, there'll be another round, another round, another round.\" And they were not thinking about changing their valuation state and they're not here.\n\nLenny (00:51:26):\nThat's a really interesting insight. This idea that you know you've crossed the chasm if you can survive without more venture funding, how do you think about that, the profit element of that? Because it feels like that's the core to being able to survive without venture funding. Is it about making enough money that you can cut and make a profit, or is there some other reason?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:51:47):\nAll you really care about is cashflow positive. I just want to be able to keep doing what I'm doing. So you don't care about the actual GAAP accounting at all.\n\nLenny (00:52:01):\nI see. So you could cut back and you can get to profitability if you need, but the idea is your cashflow positive?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:52:08):\nAnd you'd like to grow and you might want to raise money. But the point is, if you do go out to raise money, you get to raise money at a different valuation. So the way in which venture capitalists categorize you is they say, \"What risk is my money going to take off the table?\" So an angel investor says, \"Well, my money is going to take off the table, the risk of whether you can even create anything, I'm going to give you enough money to get into trouble.\" That's basically it. And then the Crossing the Chasm money says, \"I'm going to take company existence viability off the table. I don't know if you're going to grow, I don't know if you're going to become a venture return, but I'm going to take you going out of business off the table.\"\n\n(00:52:48):\nAnd then the bowling alley stuff is, \"Okay, now I'm buying probably a journey from 10 million to a hundred million dollars,\" something like that. \"And I'm expecting a growth rate,\" and this is probably where the rule of 40 starts to kick in. If you're playing the rule of 40, we want to raise more money later on, you're going to have a different valuation than we had before. And then the tornado thing by that point, now you say, \"You're in Gen AI? You have a large language module? Whoa, okay. You're worth a lot more than we thought,\" because now the category's in the tornado and that's a different game.\n\nLenny (00:53:29):\nYeah. I was going to say AI is clearly an example of being in tornado. So maybe just talk a little bit about what that is, the tornado phase and then there's the Main Street playbook.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:53:39):\nSo how do you know the difference between the bowling alley and the tornado? Prior to the tornado, when your sales team calls on the customer, they do not have a budget for you. In the early market, there's no budget for anything. In the bowling alley there's budget, but it's budget for a solution that's not you. It's for the old way of trying to bandaid the problem. So we say in the early market, you have to create budget. In the bowling alley, you have to redirect budget, but that takes sales cycles. It takes time. And if it's a small market... This is why entrepreneurs can win these market segments, because if you're a big established company, this is just a pain in the ass. It's too small a market, it's too much work, it's too hard. Redirecting the... I want my salespeople to go where the budget's already established.\n\n(00:54:28):\nWell, when does budget get established? When a category goes horizontal and people go, \"Well, yeah, we all want Wi-Fi, we all want mobile apps, we all want cloud computing, we all want whatever it is.\" And now what happens is... And by the way the pragmatist heard is they went from, \"You're not doing that, are you?\" \"No, me neither.\" \"Okay, good.\" To, \"You are, you are, you are. Oh, we're behind. We better do it.\" So these budgets come into the market and kind of all at the same time, which is what creates the tornado. Because if you give a department a budget, they will spend it and when they spend it, they're going to spend it with a vendor and whoever vendor they select they're probably going to stay with. So now the market share battle is now on, and whoever gets the most customers early on, the ecosystem starts to form around them.\n\n(00:55:23):\nSo in the nineties, we saw a lot of tornado, gorilla play. Cisco, Intel, Oracle, obviously Microsoft. I mean these companies, [inaudible 00:55:36], they were all incredibly competitive companies. They were all tornado plays. Between client server and the internet, it just created this massive tornado effect. And that game plan is very competitive sales to grab market share. And then at some point, if you're not number one, then you have to kind of do a defensive maneuver and retreat into a niche and say, \"Okay, if I can't be a gorilla, I at least need to be a chimp",

So anyway, I don't know if you saw in the paper today, but at the other end of that lifecycle, HPE has bought Juniper.\n\nLenny (00:56:28):\n[inaudible 00:56:28] is happening. I like that. That's good news. So one of the most interesting lessons you teach is also that these playbooks don't work together well. Basically if you use one in the wrong phase, it's the opposite. It has the opposite effect. So before we get there, let me just summarize maybe quickly the playbook in each of these four. I have some notes here and then maybe just talk about why is it that they fail if you pick the wrong one. So in the early market, you're looking for a visionary customer that just wants to use something new and cool and stay ahead of the curve. In the bowling alley phase, you want to engage with a pragmatic business person who has a huge problem and they need a fix and you're there for them. In the tornado, there's just this land grab, something is just going crazy, AI and everyone's just spend, spend, I need AI in my product. And then Main Street is just, it's kind of the sustaining tech that everyone just needs to make sure continues working and doesn't deteriorate.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:57:23):\nBy the way, the way I would [inaudible 00:57:25] the last two is think of tornado as kind of the land and Main Street as the expand. I mean, that's not a bad way to think about the two as well. Yeah, you got it. You got it.\n\nLenny (00:57:35):\nOkay, great. So why is it that these undercut each other if you're trying to use either the one in the wrong phase or use both?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:57:42):\nWell, so let's start with classic sales 101 from the nineties. Qualify the customer on budget before you make a sales call. That absolutely is critical on Main Street. I mean it's critical on the tornado, it's dumb on Main Street because obviously they have budget, they've got budgets that even has your name on it if you can go get it. But it's a big mistake in the early market or in the bowling alley because they don't have budget. So you're not going to get it. And the way you win in the early market is with a project model and the way you win in the bowling alley is with a solution model.\n\n(00:58:17):\nAnd the problem is if you bring a project model to the bowling alley, the problem is you won't scale because it won't be repeatable. The ecosystem won't form around you. And if you bring a solution model to the early market, it's like you're over investing in one thing. The visionary's saying, \"Well, yeah, but I have so many other things I want to do.\" So they're going to want to take you way off your solution roadmap. So each one of these things, the market dynamics call for a very clear response. It's not hard to see the response. What people struggle with is, I have been successful with this playbook, the market has moved to the next phase, but I'm really good at the old playbook, so I want to stay with the playbook I'm good at. So that's when they get in trouble.\n\nLenny (00:59:05):\nSo I think that's extra reason to pay close attention to which phase you're in and that you're practicing the correct playbook. We've talked about AI a little bit, and I don't want to get too far down this road, but I guess is there any advice you would share for an AI startup in being in this tornado or a company looking to integrate AI? Is there anything that you've seen of just make sure you're doing this right?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (00:59:26):\nWell, it's interesting about... And particularly right now, I mean the thing that's caught everybody's imagination is generative AI. So we should be thinking about things like open AI with Microsoft and Co-pilot and those kinds of things. Well, maybe not. It depends on what... So from a customer's point of view, there's AI in the early market, there's AI in the bowling alley, there's AI in the chasm, there's AI in the tornado, and there's AI on Main Street. So I mean, I would argue if you go to Microsoft Copilot, you're on Main Street, you're not taking any risk, you're experimenting with a new thing. It's kind of cool, makes you more productive. God bless. It's kind of like just an add-on to Teams or to your whole Office 365 suite. Stuff that's in the tornado right now, I don't know. I'm trying to think about what is the use case for Gen AI? I'm not sure there is one in the tornado, but the closest I would say is Salesforce is probably close enough.\n\n(01:00:23):\nThey have a sales co-pilot. They have a services copilot, right? I'm sure there marketing co-pilot. So you're going, but we're",

I'm sure there marketing co-pilot. So you're going, but we're going to change our sales motion and we're going to use generative AI in line, in our performance on a very widespread, across our entire base. So all our salespeople are going to use this new tool. That would be okay. And that makes sense because the new tool... First of all, Salesforce has their own large language module. So it's not like you're going out to the open AI world and having all those issues. So you can do it and there's a very high productivity return at a modest risk, I think, and modest disruption. For the bowling alley you'd say, I don't know if this is bowling alley or early market, I'll say it's bowling alley.\n\n(01:01:18):\nSo if you're Sal Khan and you have the Khan Academy and you're saying, \"Look, we want to provide educational resources for the world for young people.\" The problem with education right now is that particularly after the pandemic, you're a teacher you used to have... When you were a teacher in say K through 12, K through eight, you have a class of 30 kids and probably 10 to 15 of them are middle of the road and some number are actually significantly ahead and some number are behind. And your job as a teacher is to kind of work with that. Well, after the pandemic, you might have five different grade levels in the same classroom, not three or six even. That's an impossible problem. But if you said, \"Look, we can use Gen AI tutoring and we can tune it to each one of those sixth grade levels.\"\n\n(01:02:09):\nNow that's a teacher co-pilot, but that's a really specialized idea. So you go, \"Well, that's amazing.\" And then if you wanted to go to the other side, \"You say all these ad agencies say they do this really cool advertising, but I think I can do it myself with Gen AI and I'm going to sell it to other people.\" I mean, you can imagine a whole businesses that say we write legal opinions and we always start with Gen AI. We don't ship Gen AI, there's a human in the loop. We're going to do amazing or more images, maybe. We're going to design visual images with all the really cool stuff you could do. We're going to invent a new agency or a new kind of agency we're going to charge to...\" I don't know what it would be, but the point is Gen AI I think can be absorbed by the marketplace at multiple places.\n\nLenny (01:03:02):\nAs you were talking about that lawyer example, I was thinking part of the pitch would be... And it's also a lot cheaper, but that reminds me of this other post that you wrote, The Seven Deadly Sins of Crossing the Chasm. And I wanted to chat about some of these, and one of them is discounting before you cross the chasm. Can you talk about why that's something you want to avoid?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:03:20):\nBack to that issue about, \"Heart surgery 9.99, this Saturday only bring a coupon.\" I mean, the discounting model makes sense when something's commoditized or the let's even do the freemium model. The freemium model makes sense if there is no risk in adopting the offer. But chasms are based on risk bearing decisions. Basically that's the problem that creates the chasm. I have to make a risk bearing buying decision. So discounting does not reduce risk. In fact, it might even increase risk because this vendor might say, \"Well, yeah, I'll give you a better price, but now I'm not going to give you the extra support or we'll have a change of scope.\" We'll say, \"Yes, but now, that wasn't in the contract. So you have to add more.\" And all of that is fair game on Main Street, but it's not for crossing the chasm.\n\nLenny (01:04:21):\nI'm going to pick on a couple of these other sims that you mentioned. One is you call the target customer mix up. Can you talk about that?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:04:29):\nThe key to this whole Crossing the Chasm playbook is start with the world. Don't start with... Well, the question we're trying to answer is where is a small pool of trapped value that we can become our pool? So that's why we have geography, profession, use case. We're just trying to get big enough to matter, but small enough to lead is one. And then once you find that pool, the question you have to say is, \"Who controls access to that? Who's going to sponsor my deal in order for me to solve that, to release that trapped value for that company?\" That's your target customer. And you may not know them. Typically, my experience is you probably have worked with at least one company in the industry at some point along the line. It's kind of odd if you just had never heard of the industry and you picked that one.\n\n(01:05:24):\nUsually that's why I said, \"Well, maybe I should have added that to how do you know you're ready to cross the chasm?\" You should at least have a hunch. You should at least, \"We've done this work, and I think this is the one.\" Now, you still have to go validate it",

You should at least, \"We've done this work, and I think this is the one.\" Now, you still have to go validate it and make it happen. But basically the way you would validate it is rather than try to go to a research or do something, that won't work. You say, \"Well, we're going to run a marketing campaign, a modest one. I'm going to see if I can't get two more of the same use case. I'm willing to bet the next three months of my company by saying in this three months, all we're going to do is try to get two more deals that have this pattern.\" And that would be kind of the way you might go after it.\n\nLenny (01:06:10):\nSo I think this is worth spending a little more time on this idea of how you know you're ready to cross the chasm. So one is you find one very excited marquee customer, then you're sharing, maybe find a couple more and see if it's actually starting to roll and tip.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:06:26):\nNo. Well, I said it wrong. So the marquee customer is probably not in your beachhead market. The marquee customer is a famous company that you have the visionary sponsor. That's the thing, because that's the company that the business press wanted to write about, or the tech press wanted to write about. People went, \"Oh, you were the guys who...\" You're like Hans Solo. You did whatever that run was in 15 parsecs. I can't even remember what it was. But that's your claim to fame. It's your claim to fame. But the Crossing the Chasm one is, \"Oh...\" And by the way the press is not interested in the crossing chasm, but the local, if there was a local press, they'd be all over it.\n\nLenny (01:07:08):\nThe Kessel Run.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:07:11):\nThe Kessel Run. Thank you. The Kessel Run in 15 parsecs. Thank you.\n\nLenny (01:07:13):\nThat's right.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:07:14):\nExactly. That was his visionary thing.\n\nLenny (01:07:16):\nSo I think the important takeaway there is there's always this advice of talk to customers, make sure they're happy, build what... Not necessarily build what they want, but make sure you're understanding what they need. But I think when your most important insights here is make sure you're talking to the right people. Which are essentially people in the next stage, essentially of the adoption life cycle. The more pragmatists.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:07:35):\nYes. And they have to be the... I think you need to talk to the economic buyer as opposed to the end user, because the end user will be saying, \"Oh, yeah, you're right. Oh, it's just terrible and we're oppressed.\" But if their boss doesn't want to sponsor it, it doesn't work.\n\nLenny (01:07:51):\nWhich is hard, hard often when you're building B2B software, you just don't make it great. And then it's like, \"Oh, these people don't actually care what they're buying it. They just have all these check boxes.\" And then another deadly sin, which you've touched on, but I think it might be worth sharing again, is just this idea, you call it the compelling reason, confusion, where instead of thinking about your compelling reason to sell, you think about what is the pain point you're solving, compelling reason to buy.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:08:16):\nObviously as an entrepreneur, you have a compelling reason to sell. But what they tend to do is in trying to cross the chasm, if they're not using this approach, they think, \"Well, I haven't made my product attractive enough.\" So then they'd say, \"Well, I'm going to make a sexier demo, or I'm going to change my deck. I'm going to write a new...\" And the sales guy comes back, says, \"I had a great presentation. This is the deck that we ought to be using.\" And that's all about compelling ways to sell, not compelling reasons to buy. And the pragmatist, by the way... And by the way, the practice will take the meeting. One of the problems with the chasm is they don't say no. They just never say yes. And they actually encourage you... \"You should come back again with this too. This is really interesting.\" Yeah, it is really interesting.\n\nLenny (01:09:09):\nKind of along those lines, positioning, how important is that, and any advice on figuring out your positioning when you're doing this? I know you talk a lot about making sure you focus on their pain point, but at some point you're like, \"Here's what we're doing for you.\"\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:09:22):\nOne of the nice things about Crossing the Chasm is the positioning formula is absolutely the same every time. It's really cool. So basically when you're thinking about positioning, you're saying, \"Look, I'm going with this use case in this particular segment.\" So they have an incumbent vendor. The advantage of the incumbent vendor is they understand the business, but they don't have the new technology. Conversely, you have technology competitors who have as good technology, maybe a better technology than you have, but they're not committed to this domain expertise of this thing.\n\n(01",

And by the way, we have huge respect for your incumbent vendor. We're not asking you to kick them out. They just can't solve this problem. We also have respect for our peers, but frankly, they wouldn't know your problem if they wouldn't recognize it in a lineup. We are here, and by the way, if anybody comes into our quadrant, we're going to kick their ass. We are going to be beyond compare. Nobody is going to handle this problem with this kind of technology the way we will, and that's our claim of fame. That's what we're going to do, and that's our positioning.\"\n\nLenny (01:10:36):\nI love that. Say you're building a product led growth company, a bottom up oriented B2B SaaS company. Is there anything that changes in your advice?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:10:46):\nYeah, if you're going to use a volume ups approach like Atlassian or anything grows up from the bottom up, you're playing a different game. First of all, you're playing... Because you attract the end user before you attract the economic buyer. So you have some version of a freemium strategy, that's what you're going to do. And Yammer did this, right? And eventually got bought by Microsoft. So the way you play that game is, first of all, you probably do need some funding, not necessarily, maybe you can do this all on AWS and a credit card. But the game that is going to be, how do I create that moment of criticality? What you would do is you'd say... First of all, you need telemetry. So you need to figure out what are the people really doing with our product? And then you need to find a way to communicate with them to see if you can ferret out, is there a compelling reason to buy thing in their environment? So it'd be a different way of doing early market.\n\n(01:11:52):\nYou would not have a marquee client, but to cross the chasm... You cannot cross the chasm of product-led growth, you can't because it is like saying, \"Well, yeah, I'm going to cure Covid by just putting vaccines out in public places.\" It's like, \"No, people need to learn more. No.\" So you'd have to do that. Where product-led growth plays really interestingly, is in the land and expand phases of the market. If you can land with a hot product, but more importantly, product-led growth, which is really good at is expand because it prompts the user to get more involved. And that's classically a Main Street play. But there's got to be no risk. That product-led growth works when basically the extended the next purchase has very low risk, and therefore you're not really dealing with chasms.\n\nLenny (01:12:53):\nThat is incredibly interesting. Interestingly, every product led growth company ends up building a sales team, 100% of them, including Atlassian, which had product led growth for a long time. And I don't know if anyone's heard this perspective on it, that if you really want to cross the gap... I imagine it happens in some form of-\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:13:12):\nWell, and here's the thing. The reason they build a sales team eventually is they need to get enterprise deals. And obviously you need a sales team to get enterprise deals. And one of the mistakes you could make is hiring an enterprise salesperson when you're trying to cross the chasm. Enterprise salespeople are not good chasm crossers because they're used to doing horizontal coverage model. This is like no, domain expert narrow model. You want somebody that looks more like a sales engineer than a salesperson. You want somebody very diagnostic, very committed to the integrity of the problem solution framework. So it's just different.\n\nLenny (01:13:54):\nOkay. Just a couple more questions. You had this very public exchange with Martin Casado, he's a partner at Andreessen Horowitz. And just to summarize briefly, essentially he was arguing that I think some people believe once you've crossed the chasm, life's good. It's all downhill. People are going to start pulling your product out of you. It's going to be so easy. And his argument is he doesn't see that, it's endless pain and suffering and hardships. And I know you went back and forth trying to correct this, but what's a way to think about what happens?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:14:25):\nSo actually, Martin and I had a couple of this... By the way, his biggest point... I'll come back to your point in a second, but his biggest point is, \"Jeff...\" The venture community at least, and certainly Andreessen Horowitz doesn't deal with the level of granularity of Crossing the Chasm anymore. There's too much money that wants to be put to work. By the way, there's so much software already out there that the notion that your software is going to be that disruptive is increasingly improbable because you're not standing on the shoulders of giants, you're standing on the shoulders of people standing on the shoulders of people standing on the shoulders of people standing on the shoulders of giants. So he was making a bunch of those points, which I thought",

So he was making a bunch of those points, which I thought were pretty interesting. But his other point about, does life ever become easy? No, life never becomes easy. The problems change.\n\n(01:15:17):\nThe challenge with software is... Well, there's a lot of challenges with it, but software that people use, the application software, we all have different minds. We all have different contexts. To make a product that would work, that would solve what I want and solve what you want and solve what the listener wants. I mean, the margin, no. We're going to have different expectations. So there's always... And then of course there's competition, and then there's funding, and then there's technological shifts, and just about the time it really works well, they say, \"No, we got to put it... No, no, no. You put it in the data center. We got to put it in the cloud.\" \"Oh, no, no, you got in the cloud, you got to put it in Kubernetes.\" \"Oh, no, no, no. You don't understand. It's edge AI, it's not cloud.\" It just goes on and on and on. So I think if you're going to play this game, you got to be up for... Yeah, there's going to be a new headache every week.\n\nLenny (01:16:17):\nThat's exactly how I see it. I always tell founders, you shouldn't start a company unless you can't not start a company.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:16:23):\nYes. By the way, why did I leave? [inaudible 01:16:28] County was a great place to be, but I had to do my own thing.\n\nLenny (01:16:32):\nAnd that's a real pull. Kind of along the lines of something you just shared, maybe a final question. Is there something you've changed your mind about or something you've evolved your thinking on recently? Either from the beginning of the book or just even more recent?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:16:47):\nI think what I realized over time increasingly was this is a model that's really optimized for B2B markets, because it implies federated decision making around high risk buying decisions. I would say for the 20th century, that was 95% of tech. But what was so interesting about the change in the century... Because remember right at the change of the century, B2B tech went in the tank, the tech bubble just... Because everybody was afraid of the Y2K problem. So they did a whole bunch of buying up of software, and then there was a year where they think, \"Well, we ate more than we could at Thanksgiving dinner. We're not interested in eating another burger here. \"So the market went in the tank. By the way at that point, venture started saying, \"Well, maybe we should be investing in biotech, or maybe we should doing clean tech.\" Venture stepped back from the table too.\n\n(01:17:46):\nBut out of this, consumer computing came out of nowhere. And for my generation, it was unimaginable. The first time I heard about Google and they said, \"We're going to save every search argument.\" I thought, \"That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life. They're not going to be able to afford it.\" But their model was, \"We are rethinking this thing from the ground up. Geoffrey, you have no idea what we're doing.\" And boy were they right. So the point was when that came in, then consumer computing and then the iPhone hits, and then we have mobile apps. You have a world now where the B2C play can actually be the core of innovation. It used to be B2C was an afterthought. Now it's like, \"No, no, no, no, B2B might be the afterthought.\" So it's completely different... And the whole digital transformation of the universe, and we're still living through the digital transformation 20 years in, and I don't think Crossing the Chasm is designed for that problem. So that's a different problem.\n\nLenny (01:18:48):\nSo basically, if you're building a consumer app, don't spend time studying Crossing the Chasm.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:18:53):\nYeah, if you're doing B2B, this is the most reliable playbook. It's still on... People are still into this playbook 30 years in. So it's obviously... The playbook kind of works.\n\nLenny (01:19:05):\nI said this earlier, I feel like people are just reinventing many of the things you uncovered 30 years ago. Everyone's like, \"Oh yeah, target audience, really important, or finding a marque customer.\" So I'm really happy that we spent this time digging into many of your theories.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:19:22):\nWell, Lenny, thank you for being... You've been a really great prompter and questioner, so thank you very, very much.\n\nLenny (01:19:28):\nI really, really appreciate that. Is there anything you want to leave listeners with as a final thought or piece of advice or just anything?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:19:35):\nLook, I don't know if anybody's reading the paper recently, but the world's not exactly",

There's a lot of stuff going on that we could do a lot better, and software enabled technology is almost certainly at the core of any solution that scales to any world problem that matters. I think it's more important to be an entrepreneur now than maybe ever. I wouldn't make becoming a billionaire my goal. Frankly, I don't even know what a billionaire would even do with their money. I don't even how to even imagine their money. That's a thousand million dollars. It doesn't make any sense, but what does make sense? But what does make sense is to... I'm happy to get two... Do I know what to do with 10 million? Yeah. Could I do 20? Probably. Could I use a hundred? Probably not. But at some point, I want people to make yourself a great living, make yourself... But after that, have an impact. If you're gifted enough to be able to start a software company and do something original, you're a scarce resource, so don't waste it.\n\nLenny (01:20:42):\nAmazing. I'm going to sneak it one more question along these same lines actually. Your last book is very unlike all your other books. It's called The Infinite Staircase, which is essentially a guide to living a good life and a meaningful life. Is there maybe one piece of advice you could share with folks of just how to live a better life, a more meaningful life, happier life?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:21:00):\nThe purpose of that book was twofold. One was... So I was looking around... And this is an American sort of experience between social media and the politicians or whatever. Our ability to defend traditional values is becoming increasingly challenging. And historically, you say, \"Well, religion was sort of the place where the foundation for solidifying traditional values.\" But in my lifetime, the counter explanation of how we got here, other than being created by a creator, this whole the Big Bang and the Darwinian model, it's becoming increasingly credible and I'm fascinated by it. So the question I had in the back of my mind is how could you take that model and still support traditional ethics?\n\n(01:21:53):\nSo the first part was, well, what's the model? It turns out to explain getting from the Big Bang to Lenny and Geoffrey talking on this podcast, there's a lot of steps you've got to go through. But there's a whole thing about complexity and how complexity emerges in layers and the staircase is a series of layers, and the first two thirds of the book takes 11 stairs. That gets you from physics to theory. And it's like, really? Yeah, yeah. From a cloud of atoms to us talking about Crossing the Chasm, 11 steps, we can get you there. It's kind of fun. It's assembling the last 25 years of my reading. It's fascinating stuff. All these different topics, and I was just trying to knit it together. No original research. I was just literally just trying to get the story together.\n\n(01:22:41):\nBut then the last third was, okay, that's a very reasonable narrative. It's maybe even more reasonable than religious narratives, but now how do you validate ethical action and where does it come from? So the last part was about, okay, how do you do that? How does it derive from that creation story? The secular creation stories were. So that was what was important. At the end of the day, I think the message of that book is just, you really do need to do good, but it's not because you're obeying... In this framework, it's not because you're a bang a divine creator. It's because we're mammals and mammals nurture their young, and we were gifted with unconditional love when we were born because otherwise, you and I could not be here. I mean, a 1-year-old cannot... If somebody doesn't love the hell out of a 1-year-old, they're not going to be two. So we know where we started. So come on, those values were built into us. They don't have to come from above. They can come from below, and therefore, how can you integrate them into your life? And that was where the book... Anyway.\n\nLenny (01:23:53):\nThat is a beautiful message to end on. I promised I'd get you out of here in one minute. Just to let people know, you do speaking, you do consulting, where can people find you online if they want to reach out and- [inaudible 01:24:05]\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:24:05):\nLinkedIn. Yeah, I'm on LinkedIn and I have a blog on LinkedIn. And if these topics are interesting to you, you'd probably be interested in the blog.\n\nLenny (01:24:13):\nAnd then message you on LinkedIn would be the idea?\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:24:15):\nExactly. Absolutely.\n\nLenny (01:24:16):\nEasy. Geoffrey, thank you so much for being here.\n\nGeoffrey Moore (01:24:19):\nWell, thank you, Lenny. It was a pleasure.\n\nLenny (01:24:22):\nIt was my pleasure.

But if you haven't checked if there's electricity in that wall there or not, it's going to drastically change the cost and the time and everything.\n\n(00:00:16):\nWhat we need to do in a shaping session is we come out with some kind of diagram where engineers, product and design, they're saying, \"We understand that.\" So the first thing is we are not going to start something unless we can see the end from the beginning. We're not going to take a big concept and then say, \"What's the estimate for this thing?\"\n\n(00:00:37):\nWe're going to go the other way around and we're going to say, what is the maximum amount of time we're willing to go before we actually finish something? How do we come up with a idea that's going to work in the amount of time that the business is interested in spending?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):\nToday my guest is Ryan Singer. Ryan was one of the first few hires at 37signals, and through his experience of building Basecamp and 17 years of building product at 37signals, he wrote a book called Shape Up, which shares a very different approach to building software.\n\n(00:01:10):\nAppetites instead of deadlines. A big focus on bringing design engine product together into a room to shape the plan versus writing long PRDs or trying to finalize designs before you start building.\n\n(00:01:22):\nI've noticed more and more teams adopting the Shape Up method, and especially with AI starting to change how we work and build product, there's this shift coming in how product teams will operate. And so I thought this was the perfect time to do a deep dive into the Shape Up method.\n\n(00:01:37):\nThis episode is basically going to give you everything you need to give Shape Up a shot on your team or at your company to see if it fixes the problems that you're having shipping great products.\n\n(00:01:46):\nA big thank you to Des Trainer, Bob Moesta and Chris Speck for suggesting questions and topics for this conversation.

If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app.\n\n(00:02:31):\nTheir APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Versel, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant. The fine-grain authorization service.\n\n(00:02:51):\nWarrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases.\n\n(00:03:09):\nIf you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos. com.\n\n(00:03:33):\nThis episode is brought to you by Merge. Product leaders, yes, like you, cringe when they hear the word integration. They're not fun for you to scope, build, launch or maintain, and integrations probably aren't what led you to product work in the first place?\n\n(00:03:48):\nLucky for you the folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations. Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS.\n\n(00:04:02):\nOrganizations like RAMP, Dorada and Electric use Merge to access their customer's accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases and their product or HRAS data to auto-provision and deprovision access for the customer's employees.\n\n(00:04:18):\nAnd yes, if you need AI-ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it. So, want to solve your organization's integration dilemma once and for all? Book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny and receive a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny.\n\n(00:04:42):\nRyan, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nRyan Singer (00:04:46):\nI am really happy to be here. Thanks a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):\nI think this is going to be a legendary episode. There's a lot of interest these days in different ways of working, especially ways that are Agile and SAFe and Scrum and all these ways that people hear about working. Especially in this world of AI where everything's just changing. It feels like there's just an increased interest in exploring",

There's a lot of interest these days in different ways of working, especially ways that are Agile and SAFe and Scrum and all these ways that people hear about working. Especially in this world of AI where everything's just changing. It feels like there's just an increased interest in exploring different ways of working and specifically it feels like there's been a rise in interest in Shape Up the stuff that you talk about.\n\n(00:05:14):\nSo, I am really excited to basically help people understand what is this way of working, is it right for them? What are ways to start implementing it? What are maybe some pitfalls you may run into? And as much as possible get into a lot of real talk about how things are actually going on product teams that people often don't like to hear.\n\n(00:05:31):\nSo, first of all, have you also seen this increased interest in Shape Up?\n\nRyan Singer (00:05:38):\nYeah, I think it's interesting that we're talking now. I mean, the book came out in 2019 and it's, I've been hearing more and more like, \"Oh, we know somebody who's trying it or we're hearing it when we go talk to other companies.\" So, I think, it's a wave that's slowly building.\n\n(00:05:57):\nAnd it's funny, when it came out, I even tried to have an online forum to get everyone who's interested to talk together and what I started to learn pretty early on is that people don't like to talk about their struggles shipping.\n\n(00:06:13):\nEspecially CPOs and CTOs don't like to go on a public forum and say, \"Our company isn't shipping or our engineering team is stuck, or our team is always lost in the weeds.\" That's not an easy community topic on an online forum.\n\n(00:06:28):\nSo, I think, there's also some reasons why it's been word of mouth slowly gathering steam.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:33):\nThat's something I struggle with on this podcast. As you said, it's a product and product teams don't want to be sharing when things aren't going great. That's why I introduced Failure Corner on the podcast where it's like, \"Okay, but tell me a time things didn't go well.\"\n\nRyan Singer (00:06:46):\nOh yeah, that's great. Yeah, because it's so hard to get to that, right? And it's not all just this golden path, rosy, where we're all shipping beautiful, meaningful things all day.\n\n(00:06:55):\nIt's a hard business and there's no perfect school either that produces expert product managers and CPOs and CTOs and stuff like that. So we're all trying to figure this out and we don't have a lot of sources, so there is a lot of struggle.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:12):\nAnd there aren't many options for how to build product. All people really read about is Scrum/Agile/SAFe as they scale and then there's Waterfall, which, \"No, I never do Waterfall.\" Then there's the start up way of just ship and maybe one or two week cycles and then there's Shape Up, so it feels like it's one of the rare other options that exists. And so-\n\nRyan Singer (00:07:33):\nThat's one of the things I've been hearing. It's, I hear like, \"Oh, we thought there was only Scrum or Kanban, and then we heard there was this Shape Up thing. What's that?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:42):\nAnd I think it's always been connected to Basecamp. We're going to talk about that. Just, it works for companies that are nothing like Basecamp. Maybe just touch on that briefly.\n\nRyan Singer (00:07:53):\nWell, I mean, that came as a surprise to me. I mean, when I wrote the book, I had been in Basecamp at that time, I think 15 years, and I actually didn't even know the outside world. I mean, it was Jason's idea to even write the book. Because he said, \"Look, a lot of people are going to want to know about this. A lot of people are struggling.\" And I'm like, \"Well, okay.\"\n\n(00:08:16):\nI knew our inside story of we had some growing pains and we had to be able to formalize the way that we were working and shipping so that as we brought new people in that they could participate in that and we could stay fast. So, I knew our internal struggles, but I honestly didn't know anything about the outside world.\n\n(00:08:33):\nAnd it was only after the book came out that it gave me this excuse to start talking to people from all kinds of different companies, and it's been really interesting. There are some really amazing cases of companies of very different characteristics from Basecamp, like VC funded, significantly bigger, very different pressures, different team structure, different skills who are doing it.\n\n(00:08:58):\nAt the same time, there is also a lot of questions that are coming in my way because honestly, there are so few teams that are structured just like Basecamp, that there are a lot of gaps in the book of like, \"Well, what about this, and what about that, and how do we do that in our situation?\"\n\n(00:09:11):\nSo, a lot of my focus today is actually closing those gaps and helping people figure out how can I make this work for me or for our team?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:19",

Well, my wife heard me saying the same thing over and over again on every phone call. And she's overhearing me and she's like, \"You have to make a course, you have to do something. You always are saying the same thing.\"\n\n(00:09:37):\nSo then this led to this course that we made, which is called Shaping and Real Life. And well, yeah, the idea is the real life part, right? How do I make this work if my designers don't code? It's very contentious to get engineering time. You know what I mean? When there's all these different pressures that Basecamp didn't have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:56):\nWe're going to get into the nitty gritty of how this actually works and the key elements, but can you just give a very short overarching summary of how Shape Up is different from how other product approaches are?\n\nRyan Singer (00:10:07):\nI think the way it's different starts with how the way we were working was a little bit different. So, I started working with Jason and David on the first version of Basecamp, which was the flagship product of 37signals back in 2003. We were a team of three.\n\n(00:10:25):\nAnd, I mean, I think, it's for any really small team, when you're just starting out, you don't need a process. You don't need a way of working. It just happens organically because you're together. You don't have to explain it to other people, it just happens on its own, right?\n\n(00:10:40):\nBut there was always this really intense urgency from both Jason and David, \"We've got to get to something we can ship. We have to finish this and move on. We have to get to something that's done.\" There was just no tolerance for big things that got fuzzy and started to drag. There was always this sharpening to get to what is this thing really and when are we going to get to the end soon?\n\n(00:11:03):\nAnd on top of that, even when we were building V1, David wasn't actually full-time as our only technical person. He was programming 10 hours a week. So, we had this really intense pressure of how can we really use David's time well?\n\n(00:11:20):\nWe don't want to ever give something that this is the thing we want to build, and then it turns out not to be what we want and we have to throw it away and then come back again or you know what I mean? Those bad cycles of waste.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:32):\nLet me actually ask about this because this is really interesting. So this is DHH. He was working part-time when he started 37signal.\n\nRyan Singer (00:11:40):\n10 hours a week. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:41):\nWas he working on Ruby basically and that whole thing?\n\nRyan Singer (00:11:45):\nWell, Rails came out of the first... So, he told Jason, \"I want to try building this in Ruby,\" because before they had done some collaboration and David had done things in PHP before that and he had this new idea, he wanted to try Ruby, this language he fell in love with.\n\n(00:12:04):\nAnd then the framework, Ruby on Rails, he ended up releasing that after Basecamp was standing. Because it was extracted from the things that were necessary to give V1 of Basecamp to stand up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):\nSo that's what he was doing the rest of his time instead of-\n\nRyan Singer (00:12:19):\nI don't know. I don't know what he was doing the rest of his time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:19):\nProbably something great. Something-\n\nRyan Singer (00:12:23):\nBut he's always been like that. He's always doing something interesting. He's either racing or who knows what, you know what I mean? But all I knew was that we got 10 hours of that time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:33):\nYeah, I love that that was a constraint to design a way of working that uses engineering time most efficiently.\n\nRyan Singer (00:12:39):\nYeah, I mean, put that together. So, David's constraint of 10 hours a week and then Jason has this, I mean, I think, many really successful founders and especially CEOs have this thing, it's like all they want to see is movement. You know what I mean? Forward, forward, forward.\n\n(00:12:55):\nSo when do we get to see it? When do we get to try it? When do I get to put it into somebody's hands? So that combination, there was just so much urgency even though there was no outside pressure. You know what I mean? It was completely just let's say cultural energy of how do we keep getting somewhere and getting to something that we can celebrate and get excited about.\n\nLenny Rachits",

That's an attribute, I think, of a lot of successful founders. So that makes sense to hear that.\n\nRyan Singer (00:13:22):\nTotally, totally. And that's why where I come back to you, this is the part of the story where, I think, so many companies would say, \"Yeah, I know that experience,\" right? Because, I think, that's probably the seedling of, as you said, of successful companies.\n\n(00:13:34):\nIs that combination of urgency and also that those guys were so talented and that they had a clear vision of what they wanted to do and all of that. It's this amazing time actually, these early days.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:44):\nIs there anything more to the backstory that's important to share or super interesting?\n\nRyan Singer (00:13:47):\nYeah, I mean, the other big piece of it was, so Jason and I were this product, what do you call it? The two thirds. So, I was doing UX at the time and I was doing hands-on coding as well. So we're very, very integrated. Everybody does a little bit of everything. All of us were coding.\n\n(00:14:09):\nJason was in the actual app templates as well doing HTML and CSS to do the views. He's doing hands-on design. We're all very much connected with why are we building this? What is this? David's doing the bulk of the programming, and Jason and I were having these little sessions.\n\n(00:14:28):\nThese little sessions where we would really figure out what the idea was and there would be this moment where you would have a few strokes of this Sharpie pen on a big pad of paper and all of a sudden you'd be like, \"Oh yeah, that's the idea. That's the thing we want to go try to build.\"\n\n(00:14:46):\nAnd for me, those sessions with Jason, they were these short, very, very intense sessions where you're trying to crack the nut together. Where's the idea? What's the concept? How can we go... What's this thing that we're going to go and 10 hours later, right, David's going to come back and we're going to be like, \"This is awesome. This thing works and it does something we're excited about,\" right?\n\n(00:15:10):\nThat was really the seedling. I mean, actually that continued over years and years and years, those sessions. And that's the seedling of this word in the book shaping. What does it mean to do shaping? It wasn't sitting alone writing a document, it wasn't making a bunch of requirements.\n\n(00:15:31):\nIt wasn't making a beautiful Figma file to represent a concept that could maybe be a feature. It was this super intense, really exciting collaborative, \"What about this? What about that? Oh, maybe this.\" So that was a really big part of how we worked also.\n\n(00:15:51):\nVery intensely collaborative sessions to figure out what the idea is and getting it sharp enough and crispy enough that we could very confidently get a yes from David. That he would know exactly what it is and what it means and come back.\n\n(00:16:06):\nIt would be what we pictured and it would work the way that we hoped so that we would keep going and we wouldn't have to reverse or go back to the drawing board.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:15):\nWhat it sounds like is essentially you're trying to maintain the startup way of working as the company grows. Everything you're describing is how it feels to be at a startup, and this is a method to keep that. Does that sound right?\n\nRyan Singer (00:16:28):\nThat's exactly what became Shape Up, was how do we hold onto that as much as possible? I mean, one big ingredient, we had an advantage also, which was that Jason and David hired so deliberately slowly, and this is a fortunate side effect of the fact that they didn't take investment money.\n\n(00:16:51):\nSo there was never that moment of now's the moment when we grow. It was always one person. And then the organism adapts. One more person. And so, this natural way of working, it was organically spreading. There were, I think, maybe 10 years before we had the first, \"Wait a minute, what just happened?\" That project didn't go well, that's not how things normally run.\n\n(00:17:26):\nOf course there were always ups and downs, but it was about 10 years later when we had the first project. I mean, I remember the project. I remember being at the end of... It was at that time already, it had been maybe six weeks or seven weeks. We hadn't yet completely locked the six-week thing that went into Shape Up.\n\n(00:17:47):\nAnd I remember we had a review session and there was a fairly new person who's doing half of the work on that team, and we had the review session and it was like instead of, \"Oh, look, this is about ready to ship.\" It was like, \"There are a lot of open questions here.\"\n\n(00:18:06):\n\"And",

We did reach a point where it's like, \"Oh, we're going to have to figure out when this goes well, why does it go well and what do we do differently and how do we formalize that so it's reproducible as we keep onboarding more people?\"\n\n(00:18:52):\nThat's actually when Shape Up as a framework started. That's when I really started to lean in and I took over that responsibility of, \"Okay, how do I systematize this?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):\nThat's a great segue to let's actually talk about how the Shape Up method works. Maybe just at a high level, what are the core ingredients to the Shape Up method?\n\nRyan Singer (00:19:10):\nThere's basically three maybe big things. So, the first thing is this notion of we are not going to start something unless we can see the end from the beginning. So, we're not going to take a big concept and then say, \"What's the estimate for this thing?\" We're not going to say, \"Oh, we need to build a calendar and then do a whole bunch of Figma files or write a whole bunch of requirements and then ask for an estimate.\"\n\n(00:19:39):\nWe're going to go the other way around and we're going to say, \"What is our appetite for this? What is the maximum amount of time we're willing to go before we actually finish something?\" And we have that startup moment that we talked about. That moment of like, \"Ah, you know what I mean? It works. We got somewhere.\" At least this, if not the whole project, this meaningful piece, we can literally walk away from.\n\n(00:20:03):\nSo then what we found was that there was a lot of experimentation. We found that six weeks is the maximum that we can see into the future where we could actually say, \"How do we work backward and figure out something we could build in that six weeks and really land it?\"\n\n(00:20:21):\nThat's the first piece. Is working backward from the amount of time we actually want to spend on something and say, \"What can we do? What could we shape so that after that amount of time we've gotten to somewhere we want to be?\"\n\n(00:20:36):\nIt's like if you're going to buy a car or you're going to buy a house or you're going to rent a new flat or whatever, you have to have a budget in mind, right? And the budget then is how you choose between all kinds of alternatives and make a lot of hard choices and trade-offs to figure out like, \"Well, I want the faster engine, but I have to give this up, or I want it to be fun to drive, but we also need space for longer road trips.\" You're making all these trade-offs, right?\n\n(00:21:07):\nSo, this second piece is this work that we call shaping and the shaping work is, how do we actually take this fixed amount of time that we've given for ourselves and vary the scope? How do we come up with a idea, some version of this that's going to work in the amount of time that the business is interested in spending?\n\n(00:21:34):\nSo, this is those creative sessions that I was talking about where we're jumping all over the room in front of the whiteboard and getting to an idea. And there, the really key thing is that we're getting to an idea where we can see the idea. We understand why we're doing this.\n\n(00:21:52):\nWe're wrestling with the problem and we're wrestling with the solution until we have an idea that we can actually say, \"This is what we want to go build.\" So it's not just calendar or dashboard or newsletter builder, but it's this idea of how we're going to tackle this problem about the calendar request, right? So that's the shaping.\n\n(00:22:15):\nAnd then the third piece is when we've actually carved out a fixed amount of time, when we've shaped a solution that is from a experience standpoint, from a functionality standpoint, from a technical standpoint, doable and desirable, something that we can make happen in that amount of time, then we can give it to a team.\n\n(00:22:41):\nWe don't have to do the sometimes called scrum, the paper shredder. That's where you take an idea and then you split it into 100 tickets, right, and you hope that it all glues together still after you've done that step. We don't want to do that.\n\n(00:22:57):\nInstead, we want to have a whole idea, give it to a team so they see the whole, they really understand it, right? And then they can come up with their tasks and they can figure out how to track that and break it into pieces so they can actually take more responsibility.\n\n(00:23:13):",

And then they can come up with their tasks and they can figure out how to track that and break it into pieces so they can actually take more responsibility.\n\n(00:23:13):\nAnd so what we see is way more engagement, especially from the technical team, right? Because instead of, \"Here's your ticket,\" or \"Here's your user story,\" it's like, \"Here's the thing you understand, that makes sense, and now you're going to have freedom to figure out how to actually make this a reality.\"\n\n(00:23:32):\nThere's going to be a million things to solve in the implementation detail, and now you have a bunch of fun problems and you don't have to keep asking questions to other people to understand what this is or how do I make a trade off or that thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:44):\nOne of the core elements of this, and I want to confirm is that you can pick and choose these things into your team. You don't need to do this wholesale, correct?\n\nRyan Singer (00:23:54):\nYou don't need to do any of it. So, this is where it helps to look at what's going wrong and what are we trying to fix? And then what do I want to bring into this, right?\n\n(00:24:08):\nAnd usually, what I notice is that people, they like to start sometimes with, \"Oh, I want to give the team, let's say six weeks and I want to give the team more latitude or let's say more creative freedom, that they're going to be responsible in this six weeks to figure out how to make it happen.\"\n\n(00:24:24):\nAnd usually a lot of the drive for that is, \"I'm getting tired of having so many meetings and rituals and things that are not actually working on the problem and doing the work.\" I mean, especially scrum teams, they often complain about that.\n\n(00:24:40):\nSo, what they sometimes see in this is like, \"Oh, I love this idea that the team is just going to be cooking for six weeks and they're not going to, we're going to meet as needed and we're going to workshop things, but we're not going to be busy with all these rituals all the time,\" right?\n\n(00:24:54):\nNow, the thing that's tricky is that if you want that reality of the team happily buzzing and humming like some happy bee colony for this six weeks, they need to have a lot more clarity around what's the thing that we're solving, right?\n\n(00:25:12):\nAnd so when we start working backward from that, then what we see is that, \"Oh, well, if we don't shape better, then the team isn't going to have the clarity that they need to take over that responsibility, so they can make choices and make decisions and make trade offs so that they can get to the end of this thing.\" And the worst is that sometimes see cases where people are like, \"Okay, we're doing Shape Up. So, you guys are going to build the newsletter builder, okay? But you only get six weeks to do it. So use your fixed time, vary your scope and enjoy your responsibility.\" You know what I mean? Which is just cruel, right?\n\n(00:25:50):\nBecause I think I'll quote Bob Moesta, who's been on your show a couple times, \"You can't put 10 pounds of crap in a five pound bag.\" So, it's a high academic statement and we can't just take any project, no matter how giant it is, and then throw it at a team and say, \"Figure it out and ship something meaningful in six weeks by cutting away scope,\" right?\n\n(00:26:13):\nSo, it starts to raise questions about how do we actually decide together what this project is? Do we actually have clarity around what the idea is and what we're going to build?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:30):\nLet me follow up on a couple of the elements. So appetites, I think for any product manager, engineer, designer, anyone that has experienced, \"Okay, we estimate this landing page is going to take a couple of weeks. Great, let's work on it,\" and then it ends up being six weeks can understand why this makes sense.\n\n(00:26:47):\nIt's just like, \"This landing page is not that important to us. Let us just say we will commit two weeks to it. We'll do as much as we can in two weeks and then we move on. And scope is not allowed to go beyond that.\" Makes total sense. This just makes so much sense as you listen to this, especially for people that have...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:00):\nSo much sense as you listen to this, especially for people that have just fallen into the problems of estimates not being accurate. Then there's a six-week element and the key there is your, and this is counter to maybe two-week sprints like Scrum, is that kind of the where this comes?\n\nRyan Singer (00:27:18):\nSo, actually, it turns out that the six-week is only a maximum and that's really where this number does some work for us. If we think of six weeks as a maximum, that's going to force us to ask some really good questions to ourselves about what piece of this do we really think we can land? Because if you try to say, in six months, we're going to ship this thing, you can't get your arms around all",

If we think of six weeks as a maximum, that's going to force us to ask some really good questions to ourselves about what piece of this do we really think we can land? Because if you try to say, in six months, we're going to ship this thing, you can't get your arms around all of the problems that have to get solved for an entire six-month chunk of work to actually happen. There are so many unknowns, there are so many ticking time bombs of things that we didn't understand or couldn't foresee, but if we set a ceiling at six weeks, we have a much better chance of, I think that's the size of something where we can actually shape it and surface enough unknowns and reveal that complexity before we're in the middle of it.\n\n(00:28:15):\nIt doesn't mean that we can't use this technique to do a two-week project, especially if you're on a growth team, you don't want to wait six weeks or, you know what I mean? You're going to have to artificially bundle things together to do six weeks. It's like, look, I've got something I want to ship in the next week and then I've got a thing that might take two weeks after that and then a week after that. So, it's more a question of what we're trying to take on. It's really that upper limit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:39):\nOkay. So, it could be a two-week cycle and the appetite is-\n\nRyan Singer (00:28:41):\nIt could be a two-week thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:43):\nCool. So, it's like we're going to build this new landing page, we're going to give it two weeks and then do a shaping session on that.\n\nRyan Singer (00:28:48):\nNow, the other side of that is when it comes to feature development or building something that's going to be needy enough to sell, then there's very few things that are going to be a substantial value add to a product that you can do in two weeks. So, then you get into a point where, well now, we're just sprinting and we're just taking one bite after the other. And then that's where we can land in that situation where we feel like, \"Ah, I can never see the end of this. I just keep going back and saying, one more sprint, one more sprint, one more sprint.\" But six weeks is this long enough chunk or sometimes, four weeks that the question is kind of, what's big enough that we can actually get somewhere with this amount of time?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:32):\nAnd there's an implied element to this that I think is worth highlighting. The whole idea is you commit to the appetite and if you are not on track to hit that instead of extending the date you cut in order to still hit it.\n\nRyan Singer (00:29:48):\nThis is a tricky one.\n\n(00:29:51):\nSo, you're right that it's implied, but the thing is, in real life, if you make a commitment and you get alignment that we are going to spend six weeks of engineering time building this thing, if you get to that end of that six weeks and something is going wrong, it wasn't shaped, we can't see the end of it. It's more complicated than we thought. All these different things. And by the way, we can also talk about why those things happen, but when we get in that situation, if we're at the end of the six weeks and it's not looking good, we can't just cut off what we agreed to that made this thing valuable. We can't just cut the scope and say, \"Oh, well now, we managed to ship inside of six weeks.\" That's going to kill everybody's morale. Everyone's going to feel disappointed. We're going to feel like this wasn't really worthwhile.\n\n(00:30:43):\nAnd now, we go into the next cycle with this debt feeling that we didn't actually finish the thing we were supposed to finish, so now, we're like overtime. None of that is good. And if we also go the other extreme and just say, well, should we say in the book, we had this principle at base camp which was this notion of the circuit breaker. If a project is not on track to actually finish after the six weeks, we're just going to cancel it and rethink. Almost no teams have the stomach for that, but the version of that that's more stomachable is look, we can't just cancel the project and then say, \"Let's see what comes next.\" But what we can do is say, \"We're not going to keep reinvesting in something that we don't understand.\"\n\n(00:31:34):\nSo, let's take this out of build mode and bring this back into shaping mode, which might mean different people, a different conversation asking different questions, doing a different kind of work to suss out what is it that's fuzzy here? What is it that we couldn't see? What do we not understand? How do we get to the clarity that we need, so that we can actually say this thing is going to happen if we give it another whack.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):\nI love just how real this approach is not this theoretical. Okay, cool. After six weeks, use just the scope and it's all that's cool.\n\nRyan Singer (00:32:10):\nYeah, you just cut the scope.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:11):\nYeah.\n\nRyan Singer (00:32:11):\nNo problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:12):\nShape",

The shaping step is crucial. And what you mentioned with your landing page example, by the way, it's so seductive because we can imagine, oh, Parkinson's law, right? If you give me six weeks to do the landing page, I'll find a way to use it, but if you give me two weeks, then I'll stop after two weeks. But when it comes to real product work, where there's some functionality that we have to figure out how to make it exist, we can't just cut the scope if we run out of time. So, what it means is that the shaping work is really working hard together to figure out what are the main moving pieces of this thing. How do we narrow down our understanding of the problem and how do we identify what the moving parts are of the solution and what actually connects together for this feature to work?\n\n(00:33:19):\nAnd when we really get to the level where we can say, \"Oh, we need to do this, this, and then the engine is going to turn,\" that's the place where we can say, \"Oh, this is well-shaped.\" And it's a different kind of work. In shaping in real life, we call it, we actually teach it as doing live shaping sessions, and this was how I did it for years with Jason. We'd get into the room and I had both the technical and the UX side, so both sides were represented there in one person in that case, but for a lot of teams today, we actually teach them how to bring the senior engineering person who isn't just senior in title, the one who actually knows where the bodies are buried, how the old stuff works and what's truly possible and what's hard and what's easy in our infrastructure, like the person that really knows.\n\n(00:34:12):\nYou bring that person together with the product person who deeply understands the backstory of why this is an opportunity and what we're trying to solve with this. And then a designer in the room and they're whiteboarding and wrestling with each other to get to what's a version of this thing that we believe in that's real that we can actually finish in that time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:30):\nThis is great. Let's go one level deeper on this shaping session. So, a few tactical questions. How long are these sessions? It sounds like the people that join are a designer and an engineer and an NPM. So, add anything else there. And when do they happen is at the end of a... Do you call it a cycle by the way or sprint, the six-ish week period?\n\nRyan Singer (00:34:51):\nWhat I actually like is time box actually, because the thing is that some teams need regular cycles because they have parallel teams and they need that cadence in order to reduce management overhead. But if you're small and you only have one or two teams, you might not need to be on a fixed cadence or a cycle plan. You might be able to just set one time box after another. So, the key thing is actually that that time is pushing back at you and that you're being intentional about, what's my time budget that I need to shape into?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:24):\nLet me take a quick tangent because if you're, that's so interesting that the time boxes can be very different lengths. Imagine at a larger company, this gets complicated when other teams are trying, there's dependencies and timelines launch and go to market dates and all these things. What's the largest company this approach has worked at? What's the ideal company stage for Shape Up?\n\nRyan Singer (00:35:47):\nIt can function in very large companies. We have, for example, I have some friends at a, what is it called? They're doing clinical trials. So, they're in the pharmaceutical industry and the companies, thousands of people, and it's not that every team is doing this, but they have a few teams that are working in important areas and they're doing this and it's completely possible in that context, if you have someone who's at a senior level on the engineering side who is able to make the right architectural choices and also do some negotiating and be the backstop to make sure that someone isn't going to get pulled away onto something else, if you can carve out, oh, this system can be worked on independently of that system. This was actually what David at Basecamp has always been amazing at is this dependency, how...\n\n(00:36:47):\nIt's actually not. It's not. So many people are used to it and they think that it's just how it is, but it's actually not. It is possible for engineering leadership, good engineering leadership untangles things, so we can work on this system without having to be thinking about this other system somewhere else. So, when you have some untangling with your infrastructure and with your architecture from an engineering standpoint, then you have some freedom. And then if you can also figure out the capacity management side of I'm going to protect this team from that other work for this number of weeks, you can really get a lot done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:23):\nThis insight that you can operate this way",

What's the adapter? And I want to come back to the actual shaping process, but I can't help but ask this. Say the company's operating a quarterly cadence or six month cadence and then there's a team operating in a two week, sometimes six weeks, sometimes four week cadence advice on how to, what's the adapter that connects those two cadences?\n\nRyan Singer (00:37:50):\nSo, there's two different things. So, I've seen cases where they've decided on a four-week plus two-week or so they'll do five-week and then one week of cool down in between and then they time it so that it adds up to a quarter. I've seen that. The other thing I've seen is when the team is just continuously delivering meaningful things, it doesn't have to line up because from the executive level, if you are CP or CTO or in these bigger cases, it's more like a VP in some area, but you're coming to the table where you're supposed to be reporting of what your group is doing. And when you are consistently saying, \"We said we were going to do this and nothing finished and now, we're doing this and it's going to finish,\" and the next time you say, \"We said we were going to do that and it's finished, without excuses and without, well, maybe another few more months or we're working at it,\" that's what everyone wants to see is that movement.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:52):\nYeah, if you're doing great, people will leave you alone. That makes sense.\n\nRyan Singer (00:38:54):\nFor sure. For sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:56):\nI love that. I love that point. Okay, coming back to shaping, maybe one way that would make it real easy for people to understand, what's the output of the shaping session?\n\nRyan Singer (00:39:05):\nThe output of the shaping session is, and by the way, about shaping session, maybe we can talk a little bit about what shaping is not because we need the contrast sometimes. So, very often, when people try Shape Up, what I see is a product team creating either a lot of Figma files or maybe a lot of documentation, like a PRD with a bunch of requirements and a bunch of backstory and good reasons why we're doing this and stuff like that. And what you see is that when you give that to a team as this is what we shaped, what happens is it blows out. So, you probably know about what happens when the Figma file makes first contact with the engineering team. There's a reality check that happens there and very often, there's a back to the drawing board. So, when there's a lot of solutioning all the way down to detail without engineering involved, usually, that's a painful recipe and then it's like, \"No, we can't do that,\" or, \"Actually, it doesn't work like that.\"\n\n(00:40:16):\nAnd then on top of it, the other big challenge is that there's so much that you can't see on the surface of a UI. How do we flow from here to there? What are the different cases of logic? In which case do we move from here to here to here in the flow? What is happening behind the scenes? It's like the engineering team, they have to put on their x-ray goggles and study this thing to try and understand what's happening underneath. I often use this analogy of if you're doing a home renovation, you can have the most beautiful rendering of here's the new bedroom, and we're going to have these lamps on the side of the bed that are coming out from the wall, and you can have the perfect rendering and the perfect lamp and the perfect color, but if you haven't checked if there's electricity in that wall there or not, it's going to drastically change the cost and the time and everything if you're going to have to rip open those walls to feed some lines up to those lamps.\n\n(00:41:15):\nSo, what we need to do in a shaping session when it's going well is we come out with some kind of drawing or diagram where engineers, product, and design are all looking at that and they're saying, \"We understand that. I know exactly what to go build.\" I'll use the example of the calendar from the book. So, what is a calendar? So, first of all, there was this work that we had to do before we could even shape it, which is like, can we actually narrow down this problem? In shaping in real life, we call this framing. And in the book, there's a chapter called Setting the Boundaries where we get into this and it's like, look, we are not going to just build calendar, which is Google Calendar. Who knows where it ends? We narrowed it down to we understand that for our specific customers who are requesting this again and again, it's more about I need to see empty spaces and in the existing agenda view, I can only see things that are already scheduled and I can't see free spaces where I could book something.\n\n(00:42:21):\nSo, we got to that point of what we're trying to solve here is the empty spaces. So, that's a good frame. Then what are we actually going to build",

So, that's a good frame. Then what are we actually going to build? We came to, here's a good rule of thumb. If it's shaped well, you can usually describe it in less than 10 moving pieces. If I can say, \"It's going to have this, this, this, this, this, and this,\" and that's how we're going to let people see the empty spaces, that's a good indicator that it's clear enough that it's shaped well. So, in this case, when you go to an airline and you want to book something, you see this two-month grid. So, it's like there's going to be two months side by side, but they're just going to have dots in them to indicate if there's a free day or not, if there's something in that day or not, like the iPhone calendar, I think still has this where it's just dots on the month view.\n\n(00:43:17):\nAnd then if you tap a day with a dot in it or without a dot in it, there's going to be an agenda view that slides underneath, which is going to show you what's scheduled in that day. And then there's going to be navigation to go forward and back in the months, there's going to be a create button to create an event, and that's more or less it. So, what you can see here is it's not like, what is a calendar? It's not a calendar. It's a two-month dot grid with scrolling agenda view underneath and the ability to hit new when you're looking at an empty space to create something in what you're viewing. So, that's the kind of thing where that's shaped and we can talk about what that means and what it entails, and we can have a really practical, realistic conversation about, is that a thing we can do in six weeks?\n\n(00:44:12):\nThat's going to be a real conversation and not looking at a whole bunch of mock-ups and trying to x-ray to figure out what's actually the intent here and what's really real and what's not and what's possible and what's not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:23):\nThat was a great example. This is really helpful. So, if I were to try to describe this, essentially what you're coming out of it with a shaping session with is like the user experience with just wire frames/sketches of the screens and the key buttons and flows. So, it's like the architecture with key components, not like a dock of spec and not final design, and also not just a user story. As a user, I need to be able to see empty spaces.\n\nRyan Singer (00:44:56):\nExactly. So, because the thing where it goes wrong. If we're going to commit engineering time and it's like we believe there's some way to see empty spaces, but the way is a question mark, it's a really risky way to spend that time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:11):\nBecause you're committing, right? It's like-\n\nRyan Singer (00:45:12):\nYeah, we're committing and that time is really valuable. That's six weeks of engineer's time, and that time wasn't easy to get in the first place because, of course, there's all these other forces in the company that want to be doing something with the engineers. So, if we want that team to be really using that time well where they are moving, they understand what they're solving and they're creatively engaged because they know what it's supposed to be doing, they need to have that clarity both on the problem side of this is about the empty spaces and on the solution side of it's a dot grid with two months and a scrolling agenda view and a button. There's still a million interesting creative tasks there in the actual high fidelity design in the code. There's so many things to solve there, but that is something that they can all hold in their heads and understand and work on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:06):\nThis episode is brought to you by Airtable ProductCentral, the unified system that brings your entire product org together in one place. No more scattered tools, no more misaligned teams. If you're like most product leaders, you're tired of constant context switching between tools. That's why Airtable built ProductCentral after decades of working with world-class product companies. Think of it as mission control for your entire product organization. Unlike rigid point solutions, ProductCentral powers, everything from resourcing to voice of customer to road mapping to launch execution. And because it's built on Airtable's no-code platform, you can customize every workflow to match exactly how your team works. No limitations, no compromises. Ready to see it in action? Head to airtable.com/lenny to book a demo. That's airtable.com/lenny.\n\n(00:46:58):\nYou mentioned, and I think a lot of people listening to this are going to be like, \"Oh, I'm scared of doing this,\" is if you get too detailed, the engineers and designers on the team are just like, \"What the hell? You're just telling me what to build. That sucks. I don't want that kind of work.\" So, is the solution to that the engineering lead was super involved and detailed, and the design lead was super involved, and so you can trust that you're not just the code monkey building the thing they told you to build?\n\nRyan Singer (00:47:26):\nThat's really interesting.

I got to tell you, the dominant failure case that I see in the real world is always, again and again, not enough detail. And it's also the most common failure mode where the engineers run back to the product folks and say, \"I'm not getting enough from you.\" It is really like that, but I can understand why the hair stands up on the back of the neck a little bit thinking about it because, of course, if you give a senior engineer like, \"Here's how I want you to go implement the schema for this database change for this model,\" they're going to be like, \"What do you think? Who are you? Who are you?\" You know what I mean? But what's really interesting is it's not a universal thing. The amount of detail that the team is going to feel helps them is a dial that we can turn that depends on who's on the team.\n\n(00:48:28):\nSo, if you have a more junior person who's on the build team and then you have a more senior engineer who's involved in the shaping, they can make that junior engineer much more successful with additional detail. So, we're going to do this and I would suggest approaching it like this, this, this, and this. That junior person is, when they don't know how to do it, they're not going to ask because they don't want to show that they don't know, and they're going to hide the fact that they're lost and it's going to blow up later in the project. And on the other hand, if they are given more guidance, they're going to be able to be successful. They're going to learn about this is how this person who knows well, kind of approached it and then in the next round or a few projects later, you can dial it back and say, \"Well, let's give less detail and see how they handle it.\"\n\n(00:49:19):\nSo, you can really give people bigger shoes to grow into and help them to be successful. And then, of course, you can also do it the other way around where if you've got some really stellar talent on the team and you have a long history and you have a lot of trust that they are going to be able to understand and solve it, then of course, you can leave things out.\n\n(00:49:40):\nBut the thing that I often see is if there's someone on the build team who really feels that they should be involved in the fundamental decisions about the approach, then a better solution would be to actually bring them into the shaping and have them play that technical role in the shaping session. If they have the right skills and the right perspective and the right knowledge to play that role well, then just bring them into the shaping. So, it's all about how do we bring people into a moment where we are using their strengths and then we're giving them an input, so that whatever their work step is that they're able to apply the maximum creativity, but also have the maximum clarity, so that they can really use that time well and also feel good about what they're doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:29):\nIt feels like the core of this is de-risk the biggest risks and address the biggest unknowns as much as possible. There's probably this 80% of here are the risks. Let's just understand them deeply before we commit to this appetite.\n\nRyan Singer (00:50:42):\nThat is exactly right. There are these, we can call them rabbit holes, we can call them time bombs. There are these things where we say, \"Oh, it'll be fine.\" One example, simple example, I worked with a team and they had a step of onboarding in a FinTech product and there was this step of onboarding and they would lose a lot of people in the funnel at that step because you had to fill out a whole bunch of information, and they figured out that they could actually pipe that data in from one of the partners that they had. They were partnered with banks and they're like, \"Oh, we don't even need to be asking people this. So, we're going to fix conversion. We're going to eliminate a step from our user experience. It's going to be great.\"\n\n(00:51:26):\nThe thing that they didn't look at was if you go into the code on that step of the onboarding, it's not actually one step. There's like three different branches of that step depending on which bank the customer is integrated on. And so, that's the kind of thing where it all sounds so great and simple, and then you get into the weeds and you realize like, \"Oh, wait a minute.\" You know what I mean? So, now, we have decisions to make. Now, if you're in the middle of a project and it's already been resourced and people are already on the hook that we're supposed to be doing this, and you already got the alignment that the engineering time is happening for this, and you're finding that out in week four. You know what I mean? You did all these beautiful drawings, by the way, and now, you're finding this out in week four, that's a bad place to be.\n\n(00:52:14):\nBut if we're in the shaping room and we didn't kick this thing off yet, we didn't even green light the project yet, and we have an engineer there, not just the product people, not just the designer, but we have that engineer who really insists on sometimes,",

So, it's like when you've got that person in the room, they're saying, \"Yeah, that all sounds great. Let's take a quick look at the code and figure out what screen you're actually talking about. Just let's just take a quick look.\" And it only takes a moment to open up the code, find this thing that we're talking about, and really look at it and say, \"Oh, it's more complicated than we thought.\"\n\n(00:52:59):\nAnd now, it's not like, \"Okay, now, we're screwed and the project is going to be bigger.\" Now, we can have a really cool conversation about trade-offs. So, let's say we've got three different integrations here, three different segments integrated into different banks. How big are they relative to each other in terms of the deals we made or the percentage of customers who flow through those three different conditions? If we just did this on one of those branches, would it be a win? And if we did it on all three, how much more time would we have to negotiate for and would it feel worth it? You see, we're getting into this horse-trading of what is important, what's worth it, what do we need to get out of it? And that's really productive. And when you're doing that before the project starts off, that feels like, \"Oh, we're talking about the important things. We're not failing right now. We are engaged in the hard questions that are going to enable us to really ship something that's successful later.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:54):\nWell, let's go one level deeper on this shaping session, because clearly, that is so core to this working, and I know you have a whole book about how to actually do this. So, we're not going to-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:00):\n... to this working, and I know you have a whole book about how to actually do this, so we're not going to answer all the questions, and there's a lot of detail and nuance. But a few questions, how long do these usually take? It sounds like a whole day experience, and then it sounds like you invite as few people as possible, but not too few people. What's your guidance on who should join?\n\nRyan Singer (00:54:21):\nIn this shaping and real life course, we've been doing workshops where we try to help people to learn what it's like in a shaping session. One of the things that's always interesting to me is how... So Kathy and I will be running the session and we have to... People aren't used to working so fast. What are we actually doing right now? What's the decision? What's an idea right now? We're not going to go away and draw something, and then I'll comment on a document and then come back and get together tomorrow. What ideas do we actually have right now starting from zero? So imagine, we've narrowed down the calendar problem too. It's about empty spaces. We are willing, from a business standpoint, to spend six weeks on a whack at this where it's solved. We believe there's a way that's possible, so what can we come up with?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:23):\nAnd that's the input to the framing session or sorry, the shaping session.\n\nRyan Singer (00:55:27):\nExactly. Having a narrowed down problem from the framing work, and this is a whole other topic of very often the PMs are sometimes just taking something at face value and not negotiating down to really narrow down what is this really, and where is the value in this? But let's suppose that that's happened, that we've narrowed down the problem, so now we've got a narrow problem. So now what we need to do is try out different ideas, and this is the real thing. We have to try to break them. So I want to draw an idea, and then I want the technical person to find, oh, this isn't going to... You know what I mean? This isn't going to work because of this reason. Or the product person is going to be looking in and saying, \"I get that that's really an easy way to do it technically, but I don't think that we're actually delivering the value if I play through the customer scenario here.\" You know what I mean?\n\n(00:56:24):\nSo there's these different angles where the idea can fail, and one of the things that we also coach people to do in a session is not just to go down one path and then be stuck in one idea and now you're going in circles around little details of one idea for three hours, but to really step back and say, \"Here's an approach. What if we had the scrolling agenda view, okay? And that's idea A. Then what's a very different way of doing this?\" Do you know what I mean? If we didn't want to have the agenda view there, is there a way to do this where it's just a month view? Let's see if we can draw that. So that's the thing that's happening. You asked about the time, and I started with people aren't used to just going all the way in to actually trying ideas.\n\n(00:57:16):\nSo there is",

You asked about the time, and I started with people aren't used to just going all the way in to actually trying ideas.\n\n(00:57:16):\nSo there is a little bit of learning how to just face that blank page and start trying things together. What we find is that a three-hour session can be very, very productive to help you figure out what do we already have that are possible approaches to this? What are some major missing things? Like, okay, I've got the calendar dot grid, I've got the agenda idea, but what about multi-day events? Do you know what I mean? So there can be these things, these what abouts. So then maybe we break and we think for a little bit, and somebody sketches some ideas on that and does a spike or two on something, and we come back again for another three hours or we come back the next day. And what I would say is if the project that you're trying to do is doable with, let's say, your existing technology, you're not inventing a new algorithm, you're not inventing some new database or... You know what I mean?\n\n(00:58:25):\nYou're not doing a new AI model. It's more about how do I use the APIs and the frameworks and the tech stack that we have? How do I put that together to build something? Then if the problem is clear and the time is now, you will be able to come to a conclusion about what's possible to build in three sessions, something like that. The key thing is leaning into those sessions and really wrestling with each other. If you have just the product and the designer there and then it's like, well, we'll show this to the technical person later, then it can all blow up. And then you find out it's more complicated than you thought and you have to go back to the drawing board. We need to have all the necessary information in the same room for these sessions to go fast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:17):\nThere's so much genius built into this approach, and it sits on top of human nature. One is just, you need to actually spend... go into the deep edge cases and nuances and not just-\n\nRyan Singer (00:59:31):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:32):\nYeah, that's fine. Let's go with [inaudible 00:59:34].\n\nRyan Singer (00:59:33):\nMore concreteness.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:34):\nVery concrete, very in depth, and then the appetites are... There's just so many elements of this that just connect with the way humans work versus the theory of just like, \"Yeah. Well, let's see how long this will take. It'll be a great... and we'll figure it out as we're building. We don't need to really figure this out. Yeah. We don't have time for that.\"\n\nRyan Singer (00:59:52):\nAnd we're solving a puzzle together, if it needs to be doable in this amount of time. But it also has to hit these points in terms of the problem we're solving. You know what I mean? It has to do these things, but in this time. One other thing that I would mention is that we can't be drawing Figma files. By the way, I'm being very mean to Figma so far in this conversation. There is a time when it's the right time for the Figma file. What we want to do is have that clarity around the... Let's say, we already know where the sink is going in the kitchen and now we can make final calls about the tile and the exact fixture-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:38):\nGrout color.\n\nRyan Singer (01:00:38):\n... and stuff like that. Right, grout color. We don't want to have to throw it all away every time something changes. So there's a time and a place where Figma is amazing and feels good and it's like, oh, now it's beautiful. Now, it's amazing. But in a shaping session, you can't collaborate on something so high fidelity. So we need also some ways to collaborate, and this is where you see these techniques in the book, like breadboarding and fat marker sketching. These are tools to help us express an idea very, very clearly in detail. We're going to hit this button and from this button, go to here. This calculation runs, then we get this answer, and then we have this choice to go here or here. That's the thing that we need to be seeing and that's the level of detail where we can move fast together but still see something real as more this breadboarding level.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:33):\nFat marker session is very evocative of what this whole session is about, is very high level sketches. That's a great term.\n\nRyan Singer (01:01:41):\nThe danger there that I often see is that what we don't want is to say, \"Oh, Figma isn't the right thing at this level. So instead, we're going to do fat marker sketches,\" and what you get is the equivalent of a blurry Figma. Do you know what I mean? Just less detailed. What we need from a fat marker sketch for it to be valuable to us as builders is it has to really communicate the idea. When I look at that, I'm like, \"Oh, now I get it?\" And if it's more this general wire frame of dashboard goes here and there's",

    "content": "isn't the right thing at this level. So instead, we're going to do fat marker sketches,\" and what you get is the equivalent of a blurry Figma. Do you know what I mean? Just less detailed. What we need from a fat marker sketch for it to be valuable to us as builders is it has to really communicate the idea. When I look at that, I'm like, \"Oh, now I get it?\" And if it's more this general wire frame of dashboard goes here and there's going to be four reports, and it's like I still don't know what to build, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:41):\nMm-hmm.\n\nRyan Singer (01:02:23):\nSo if it's not telling me what to build, so maybe this is a way to come back to your question about what's the output of the shaping session, it's like it's shaped if we can give this to a technical person and they say, \"Yeah, I know what to go build now.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:37):\nI'm very happy with our overview of the process. I think we've done a really good job giving people the gist. And obviously, if they want to actually implement it, they can get the book and dive in or work with you, which we'll point people to. Say someone's like, \"This is awesome. I want to do this.\" What would you say is a good first step for a team that's currently... let's say, they're in startup land, and they're just shipping every two weeks, maybe every week? So maybe for that bucket of folks and then also for a larger company, I don't know, Agile Scrum SAFe, and they're just like, \"Oh, let's try something different.\"\n\nRyan Singer (01:03:07):\nSometimes dev teams, they like the idea of not having the Scrum ritual, so they want to take in the six weeks, but unless the engineering and product come together to figure out how to collaboratively shape, like we talked about before, that time box isn't going to go well. So I-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:28):\nThey think they're going to not have to do standups, but now it's a day of hard thinking.\n\nRyan Singer (01:03:33):\nWell, it turns into even more meetings, because we don't know what to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:39):\nAnd the more meetings is just that shaping session specifically. Right?\n\nRyan Singer (01:03:44):\nNo, what I mean is that if we didn't-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:45):\nOh, right. I [inaudible 01:03:46] right.\n\nRyan Singer (01:03:46):\nIf we only adopted the six-week cycle and said we're going to figure it out and we didn't adopt the shaping, then we just don't know what to do. And then we reached the end, and we're basically scrambling to shape it as we go. And then we run out of time, and then we feel like this wasn't... It was nice to get a break from the Scrum rituals, but we can't say that we are knocking the champagne bottle on the boat because we're celebrating the launch or whatever, again and again. Right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:13):\nThat's a good, actually, time to maybe talk about there's obviously the spring kickoff in Scrum. What's main difference for people, because they may be thinking, \"Oh, this is just like a spring kickoff.\" That's-\n\nRyan Singer (01:04:22):\nOh, that's a good one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:23):\n... big deal.\n\nRyan Singer (01:04:24):\nThat's a good one. So what you often see in a Scrum team is that there's somebody who creates these tickets of these are the things that are going to happen inside of the sprint. Really, in my opinion, too many cases, it's not the person who's doing the building who's creating those tickets.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:45):\nSo your product owner.\n\nRyan Singer (01:04:46):\nSo there's a big, big gap there. We could talk a lot about that, but there's gaps in context. The person who's writing the ticket doesn't actually understand the work that's involved. You know what I mean? So there are so many unknowns and time bombs waiting in those tickets that sound reasonable, but they weren't really created by the person who understands the work that needs to happen. So the key difference is two things. So in Scrum, you have a person who's not the builders making tickets, and this is what in the cruel picture is the paper shredder. In the shape-up world, you have a single idea that was shaped. This is the thing we shaped with the two months in the agenda view and da da. Go make your own tasks, because you're the professionals. Do you know what I mean? So the contractors, if you're building a house, they have to know the plans, but you don't have to tell them, \"Now take the hammer and go over here.\"\n\n(01:05:52):\nThat's their, right? So in a shape-up world, a kickoff is, here's the well-shaped idea, and now this time box starts. At Basecamp, it was really, really loose because they are just stocked with senior people. They have so many very senior engineers and all the designers are coding. They're very technical, really, really skilled people. What I found is helpful when the team is a little bit more mixed, if they're not all super senior, is a simple exercise of at kickoff, take whatever was shaped and just draw a grid with nine boxes, and give me nine boxes of the nine major chunks that you think have",

So translate this into nine major scopes of implementation that need to somehow happen over the time box. So really, really useful exercise to kick things off, and we have a lot of teams doing that now.\n\n(01:06:52):\nIf you take six weeks, that's 30 business days. You divide that by nine, it's four days per box. So you're going to get a lot of clarity from a quick exercise. And again, this is done by the builders. This is a really also good exercise for them to notice like, \"Oh, wait a minute, we think there's too much scope here. Even though it seemed reasonable, when we put it into nine boxes, it's like, I don't think we can do this all.\" Or it's also a good moment where somebody who's more junior might describe their implementation approach, and then someone who's senior can review that and say, \"Actually, we've done that before, and we'll run into this trouble if we don't use this other thing.\" So those really nice coaching moments can happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:39):\nIf you were to try this approach and have a shaping session, this is a sign you're heading in a good direction, is if the output, the team that's building it can come up with nine... Does it have to be nine? Is six cool, 10 cool?\n\nRyan Singer (01:07:55):\nWhat I found is if it's more than 10, then you just get into ticket land of, here's a million things I have to do. You know what I mean? If you have 100 things, that doesn't tell me anything. But if it has to be nine or less.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:10):\nNine or less. Okay. Okay, cool.\n\nRyan Singer (01:08:13):\nI actually think... I'm speculating here, but the UX designers in your audience will know about this rule of seven, plus or minus two. It's this cognitive science principle that was found about how many things someone can hold in their head at once. So this nine is the upper limit of seven plus or minus two, and it basically... It's like, do we actually have a picture of what it means to build this that we can also hold in our heads? Can we see the whole castle?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:41):\nSo what I'm hearing is if you're on a, say, Agile Scrum team today, if you want to start trying this out, it's schedule a shaping session, assume it's six weeks to start, try to come into it with a framing of here's the problem we're trying to solve. Is that a good way of thinking about it, like the problem we're trying to solve?\n\nRyan Singer (01:08:59):\nYeah, for sure. The question is what problem are we trying to solve, because the shaping work is more what are our options for the solution? And if the problem is too fuzzy and big, if the problem is just calendar, then the shaping is going to be this ever-expanding, never-ending thing, and we're not going to be able to get anywhere.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:16):\nYeah. Okay. So you spend three hours, maybe six hours in the first session. Would you recommend try to keep it to this many hours when you're first trying it up?\n\nRyan Singer (01:09:26):\nNo, I wouldn't do that. I think the key thing is actually if you get to the point where you're trying to hold a shaping session and you manage to get product and engineering into the same room to do it, you are far along. You're doing great if you're at that point. Oh, so much of the challenge is getting to the point of aligning between product and engineering that we cannot have projects that are dragging and dragging and dragging. We can't keep ending in a place where this is the end of a sprint or the end of a cycle and we still can't see the end of it, or we have to make so many cuts and compromises at the last minute that it's not the quality of... or it's not really matching what it was supposed to be in the first place. When those problems are happening or... Also by the way, this is surfacing at the exact level.\n\n(01:10:22):\nImagine, you're the CPO, you're the CTO, and you are supposed to be answering to, \"How's that work going?\"\n\n(01:10:30):\nAnd it's like, \"Well, actually, we're working on it. I can just think of a couple of times when I needed to go to Jason, and he expected me to be making progress on something and I had gotten nowhere on it. And that feeling when you are with top leadership in the room and you don't have a good answer for where you are on something is like... Oh, it's brutal, right? And then from the CEO's perspective, it's like, \"Where's the movement? We're running a business here. Really, nothing is shipping still?\"\n\n(01:11:03):\nThis can't just keep happening. So there's some recognition somewhere either at the higher levels or within the team of, we don't want to keep dragging, we don't want to keep being lost in the weeds, and then this can be the activation energy",

So there's some recognition somewhere either at the higher levels or within the team of, we don't want to keep dragging, we don't want to keep being lost in the weeds, and then this can be the activation energy. You gather the power to be like, \"Okay, we actually want to try something different.\"\n\n(01:11:26):\nAnd in that case, what I would say is what usually works best is, okay, we're going to try a pilot project, and what we want to do is, as you said, choose a problem that's important enough to all of us that we think it's meaningful, it's going to be worth trying to do well. And it doesn't have to be six weeks. It could be something that is a little bit smaller, maybe you feel comfortable taking on three week thing for the first time. What's important is just matching these things together.\n\n(01:11:55):\nHere's a problem that we actually care about. It's timely, something that we would like to be shipped soon. It's not so small that we're not going to actually learn this new muscle, and it's big enough that it's going to feel like we really achieved something. So maybe that's going to be four weeks, maybe it's going to be six, maybe it's three, I don't know. And then getting to a place where we wrestle a bit with the problem to get the problem narrowed down. We get into our shaping session, and then we do our best. Do you know what I mean? And usually, what happens too is if we have an engineering team that's going to become free to do this work for those X number of weeks, that's the upper limit on how long we can spend to shape, and that's another real life thing, is sometimes we talk about if...\n\n(01:12:51):\nOn the one hand there's this universe of never ending documents back and forth to get feedback and comments, and then on the other hand there's like the team is going to be available. We're trying to actually do this, so actually, we've got a week to shape because engineering needs to kick off next week. Do you know what I mean? That's a little bit more the real scenario when you're actually in this aligned world of we want to ship something now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:16):\nYeah, real life constraints. That's a really helpful way of telling you how much time you have to do this. For people that are just like, \"I don't know, any friends that are using this. It's like weird, this way of working. It's not a thing I hear about all the time.\" What can you say to them to help them be like, \"Okay, I should actually give this a try. Here's how many people are using it. Here's impact that you've seen.\" Anything you can share that would help them get over that hump?\n\nRyan Singer (01:13:40):\nI would say wait until it hurts more. If the unfamiliarity is the big problem with it, then maybe the things are fine. Because it's not like this is the only way. It's more like, changing is really hard, and if there's a good reason to do it and it's like, look, we've done it the old way. We've tried different experiments. We've even already churned through a new head of product, or we've got a different CTO in and we're still having the same problems, then there comes a point where it's like, I know that this is uncomfortable, and I don't know somebody who's done it, but I think we need to try something different because we can't continue this way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:30):\nThat is a great answer. Following that same thread, just what are signs that it's time to try something? What sort of pain do you often see that's like, okay, you shouldn't look into this seriously?\n\nRyan Singer (01:14:44):\nThere are pains all along the journey. So I think the place where it's most obvious is at the end of the line when we thought we were going to be done and this thing is just dragging and dragging and dragging. The teams, we're not shipping things. We're running in place. We keep going in circles on this like we don't see the end. Of course, that's the culmination, but there's also a lot of pain points along the way.\n\n(01:15:11):\nSo if we go all the way upstream, if we go to the source of a project, sales talk to a customer... You know what I mean? Or sales talk to a lead, and they have this idea of this thing we need to build, or the CEO had this idea in the shower the other day, or the product team did a whole bunch of research and they have a big case for why this is the thing that's important to build next. Whatever it is, there's a source from the business perspective of this is the thing we should do next.\n\n(01:15:44):\nIf we just say dashboard and we don't negotiate what that means, if we just say calendar and we don't negotiate what that actually is, then what do we experience? This fuzzy thing where it's really hard to get to a conclusive answer about, yeah, that's what we need to go do. It's like the ever expanding blob. So if you've felt that before, that's already a first pain. And then of course, where does it go from there? So we say calendar, so we don't know what it means, but we say calendar, so now we give it to product and we've either got a whole bunch of Figma files or we have",

So we say calendar, so we don't know what it means, but we say calendar, so now we give it to product and we've either got a whole bunch of Figma files or we have the PRD with a million requirements about what a great calendar is. Of course, I don't want to be cruel to the people who are putting their hearts into that work, because the Figma file is beautiful. It's just coming a little early. And the PRD is full of a lot of true things that are probably really important for decision-making in the project, but the way that it's packaged at that moment isn't something that gets absorbed. You write this document and I'm sorry, who actually reads it? You know what I mean? I know it's painful, but it's like that. And then even when we try to read it, because it wasn't shaped and we didn't get down to it's this, it's that, it's that, and that's how it works, it's hard to walk away from reading that and have anything that's in your head as, this is what we're going to go build. It's like a million puzzle pieces that you're going to have to solve. So what we see is either there's the Figma file and then there's the pushback from engineers. There's the PRD, but then it's like, okay, but we still don't actually know what to build.\n\n(01:17:40):\nThere's all those things where, instead of moving forward, there's more and more questions, more and more pushback, more and more going back to the drawing board. So that's another big indicator that something is going wrong. And then when we're in the building and we thought we knew what we agreed to, we thought we all said, \"Yeah, this is what we want to go make,\" and it's just more and more questions coming out. More and more unexpected complexity, things that we didn't anticipate, and it just doesn't feel like we're getting warmer and coming closer. It just feels like it's getting harder and harder. Those are all the signs that whatever process you use, that there's a lack of clear shaping and there's a lack of clear framing because there's a lack of clarity around what it is that we're doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:26):\nBefore we started recording, you made this interesting point that there's always talk of feature factories and that rarely are they actually efficient factories. They don't actually work. Talk about that.\n\nRyan Singer (01:18:38):\nYeah. Well, I understand what the feature factory critique is supposed to be. It's actually to the framing point of we're not negotiating the value and the outcome we're trying to get from something. We're just taking it and building it. And then of course, in the end, according to the feature factory critique, we just built it because somebody said we should build it, and then people didn't use it and didn't value it, and the product is just getting bloated. The thing is that, I would say if you have a feature factory, meaning you're continually cranking out features, you're probably quite healthy. All you need to do is feed a different input to the beginning of the factory.\n\n(01:19:18):\nWhat most teams are struggling with is that they don't have predictable repeatable shipping of things. At least from my experience, the bigger really widespread struggle is, stuff isn't moving, it's dragging. I can't see the end. I'm losing my... I'm feeling burned out. You know what I mean? It's not exciting to work on this anymore, all that a thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):\nMaybe last question here is what's the sweet spot stage for a company to start using Shape Up? You basically worked in this way from the very beginning when it was just three people. What do you find... Should startups that are just starting out start working in this way, or do you find it's more useful later on?\n\nRyan Singer (01:19:58):\nWe didn't formalize it until we had to, and there was a long time where there wasn't a fixed length for projects. There was just an understanding of the urgency and a feeling of what too long felt like. And it didn't actually click into, oh, this is a cycle length and this is six weeks, and then we pause, and this is who comes together to make the decision of what's the next project, and here's who is mainly doing the shape. You know what I mean? All that stuff didn't get solved until we had reached a certain size. Usually, the main tipping point if we start from smaller to big is there's a phase when the founders are still involved in everything, and so it doesn't matter what your process is, it's going to be fine.\n\n(01:20:40):\nBut then you start to hire the first other people and then for the first time you try to delegate some of those things and the founders try to be less involved, and that's often where a lot of these problems start to appear. And the founders start to ask themselves like, \"We used to be fast, and now we hired people because we needed to scale, but now we're slow. So how do we be fast again? Because we know what-\n\nRyan Singer (01:21:00):\n... well. So like, \"How will we be fast again?\" Because we know what it's like. If we just got back in there as founders and got our hands dirty, like we could make this go. But how do I get the people that we've brought in to make these trade-offs and make these decisions and how do I get the work to",

But how do I get the people that we've brought in to make these trade-offs and make these decisions and how do I get the work to flow again? So that's something that we definitely see there. So that's a really good moment. I'm onboarding new people. I don't know what to tell them how to work. I don't want to introduce a bunch of scrum rituals. Just winging it on Kanban isn't working, because they don't have enough clarity around what to go after. So I have to babysit them all the time. You know what I mean? Like these kinds of things.\n\n(01:21:40):\nThere is another extreme, which is I... We've already gone past that. We've been scrum or whatever for years. The company has been growing, like revenue is coming in, like sales is doing their job, like things are running. But man, nothing is getting out the door. And we're years in and we have an entrenched development. We have like an entrenched engineering team, which is a wall away from an entrenched product team and everybody's apart. And this thing is like, we're like stuck.\n\n(01:22:19):\nAnd that is more where there's going to be some tensions that are starting to appear at the executive level. There's going to be some finger pointing. There's going to be some like, \"Why isn't this moving? Why isn't this happening? How can we be spending so much money in all these engineers and we don't have anything to show for it?\" And that's a point where there can be kind of a... Some hard conversations need to start happening about, \"How do we actually start to negotiate around how we spend time?\" And we can't just have endless refactorings and infrastructure projects, but we need to be actually building things that we can sell again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:54):\nWhat an idea.\n\nRyan Singer (01:22:56):\nYeah. You know? But it can... There are a lot of engineering orgs that have been standing around for a while and it's all refactoring all day and tech debt and stuff like that. And there's reasons why all those things got there, but there comes a point where we have to figure out how to cut through it and make some hard choices so that we can carve out time to build the stuff that's actually going to be needle moving again and not just sustaining us where we are to run in place.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:24):\nI imagine this latter bucket is who you mostly work with, the kind of companies that bring you in.\n\nRyan Singer (01:23:33):\nIt's been a lot of the folks who still remember what it was like to be fast and they're kind of newly too big and they don't like being slow. I've had a lot of that. I think that your intuition is right. That the market for the last category is the biggest, but it's hard to reach them. It's not easy to talk about these things. These are sensitive topics. Do you know what I mean? Like, \"Our engineering team isn't shipping,\" and it's happening at leadership level. There's a ton of complaints happening deeper in the org, but nobody down in the org can change anything. At the end of the day, it's actually the interface at the executive level of being able to say, \"How are we using our time? We have to change something.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:19):\nTo make it even more concrete in that first bucket, what's the size of org that you find is most in need of this? It's like, \"How many engineers?\" Or is it like when they hire the first PM? Like what's kind of the-\n\nRyan Singer (01:24:29):\nI sometimes have the like, \"How the heck do I hire the first PM and what do they do?\" conversation. But usually, it's later than that. It's after they hired the first PM, after they hired the second PM, and maybe even the third. And they're getting to the... Product and engineering together are like 30, 50 people and it's like, \"We thought we put everybody in the right roles. We kind of did what we were supposed to do and everything is just grinding. And why are we so slow?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:57):\nPerfect. So 30 to 50-ish people seems like a good time to... Basically, you're finding that's when things start to really break down.\n\nRyan Singer (01:25:05):\nThat's when they show themselves and I think... I mean, if someone hears this and it all starts to make sense and they're earlier in that wave, then of course the earlier that you can anticipate it, the better, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:16):\nYeah. That's a good point.\n\nRyan Singer (01:25:16):\nSo if you're-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:17):\nWhen it's too late is when they come out so-\n\nRyan Singer (01:25:19):\nI mainly hear about it when it's too late. That's why they're reaching out-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:22):\nGot it. So maybe closer to 30. Okay.\n\nRyan Singer (01:25:26):\nHonestly, I think it starts the first project where, for example, the founding engineer is hands off and then the new hire is taking over responsibility. Or the person who was",

So maybe closer to 30. Okay.\n\nRyan Singer (01:25:26):\nHonestly, I think it starts the first project where, for example, the founding engineer is hands off and then the new hire is taking over responsibility. Or the person who was like sort of founder/CEO is first giving it to a PM to kind of thinking they're going to carry it through. And then, it's not exactly meeting their expectations of what they thought was going to happen. I think that's when those disconnects actually start. It's the first step away from the work where the seeds of all of these problems actually start.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:00):\nI want to talk about Basecamp and how maybe not every company can operate like Basecamp. Before we get there, is there anything else along the lines of Shape Up that you want to add or share?\n\nRyan Singer (01:26:10):\nYeah. There's one key thing, which is the role of the PM. I think what we see today, out of necessity in a lot of teams, is that the PMs spend a lot of time chasing around inside of the build phase, inside the time box, to try and make sure that people aren't stuck and getting lost in the weeds and try and keep things moving. And it can sometimes be too close to project management rather than product management.\n\n(01:26:43):\nAnd what we see in Shape Up teams when they hit their stride is that the PM moves upstream. So the PM is less busy with, \"How do I get this project to not be in a bad state when it's getting built?\" And they're way more in, \"How do I understand the business context? How do I narrow down the problem? How do I negotiate back and forth with maybe the CPO who brought this to me to understand where the core of it is?\" That really getting the deeper understanding of the business and the problem and the customer domain and like what problem is worth solving and what's even slice of that problem is the valuable slice to argue that we should spend a few weeks on. That's the place where the PMs can really contribute a lot in the Shape Up world. That's kind of what they do, rather than shepherding the process or being a ritual master or something like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:42):\nThat sounds pretty wonderful. I've been doing some thinking about what an AI-oriented world does to the role of PM and it feels like very similar to that actually, where the building now is going to happen for you with AI tooling. And that means the bigger question now is like, \"What the hell should I build? And is the thing I've built right and correct and likely to work?\" And it feels like this is similar, it's like the PM spending a lot more time upfront thinking through what to build. And then, the building is a lot more hands off. So hands off it gets done in like five minutes when you're just like, \"Well, build this thing for me.\" \"There it is.\"\n\nRyan Singer (01:28:19):\nYeah. Let's see. Let's see. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:21):\nLet's see.\n\nRyan Singer (01:28:22):\nI'm also very curious. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:25):\nOh, man. What a wild time. Okay. Let's talk about Basecamp. I think we talked about this ahead of the podcast that... You want people to know that Basecamp is very unique and not everyone can work the way Basecamp works. Just talk about your insight there and your advice there when people see all this advice coming out of Basecamp.\n\nRyan Singer (01:28:45):\nI got to tell you, I had no idea how unique we were until I was outside and there are so many things. For example, it's a lot of the things that people ask me about that are not in the book that started to reveal those things to me. That's so many things that I was just taking for granted. I mean, every designer codes.\n\n(01:29:05):\nImagine, if every designer codes and I don't just mean HTML. I mean, like running the app locally, going in to the place where that view is rendered to make that thing look the way that they want it to look or whatever, right? I mean, like really codes, every designer. So every designer codes, where's the wall between design and engineering? Where is the moment where you arrive with the Figma file and then the disappointment and all of your hopes get destroyed because the engineer is telling you no, right? Like those moments don't even exist in that world.\n\n(01:29:42):\nAnd then, also, I think also there was this lack of distance between sort of the business objective, the thing that we're trying to... The reason we want to maybe do this project and the blessing of the founders and the... Like, there wasn't this kind of executives far away with some big targets and then some layer of PM and then some building. I mean, the founders were always there, right there in the problem definition still.\n\n(01:30:14):\nI mean, I can't say today, but I mean up until 2021 when I was still there. So it meant that there was so much clarity all the time around what we're solving and why and why we're making time for it. And then, of course, on the engineering side as well. I mean, imagine, you have no sales org, you have no marketing. That all of selling and marketing is",

So it meant that there was so much clarity all the time around what we're solving and why and why we're making time for it. And then, of course, on the engineering side as well. I mean, imagine, you have no sales org, you have no marketing. That all of selling and marketing is happening by the unicorn founders. So it means that there isn't contention for engineering time, that there isn't like all these different sources of requests that you have to wrestle with,\n\n(01:30:50):\nAnd David did such an extraordinary job of... I mean, the more I see the real world, the more I'm amazed at how every six weeks, there was clear runway in engineering of like, \"We have time for whatever the... Whatever we'd agreed together is the most important thing.\" Just blank check like six weeks at a time. Not a blank check, but you know what I mean? Like a blank six weeks, yeah?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:15):\nYeah.\n\nRyan Singer (01:31:16):\nAgain and again and again, years without end. Keeping that engineering capacity focused on readiness for product and totally leaning into what's exciting to do to build for the product. And not getting lost in all this refactoring and new infrastructure and technical debt and stuff like that. I mean, those are amazing. So those are some really big differences. And it doesn't mean that you have to be Basecamp to do Shape Up. But what it does mean is that when we say, \"Oh, just have a shaping session and if you have the pressure of the time box, then you can make trade-offs together.\" It's like, \"Well, if we are used to having a big wall between, for example, engineering and design, then we're going to have to learn...\" Somebody who wants to start shaping is going to have to learn like, \"Well, oh, I need to figure out who to bring together and how to have that session and how do we interact with each other. So that we are combining all of that knowledge that maybe at Basecamp was all in the same head in a lot of cases.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:18):\nThis is such an important point for people to hear, because there's so many people that come on podcasts like this and share, \"Here's how to do it,\" based on their experience. And there's so many just assumptions about their resources, the people they hire, the way the founders operate. Like no sales team, I think that's like... I don't even think about that.\n\nRyan Singer (01:32:36):\nYeah. Imagine, no such thing as a request from sales, yeah? No such thing as pressure of like, \"We need this thing in order to upsell or to close this deal.\" Never.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:47):\nIt sounds like you're in this Basecamp... By the way, was it called 37signals? Like it's interesting you call it Basecamp not 37signal.\n\nRyan Singer (01:32:54):\nYeah. I mean, so it's just like the timing of when I left. We were originally 37signals and then Basecamp became so big that we renamed ourselves to Basecamp.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:03):\nI didn't know that.\n\nRyan Singer (01:33:04):\nYeah. And then, so for example, on the book, it says Shape Up and there's a Basecamp logo on the bottom, not a 37signals logo. But then, since I went back, so it's 37signals again. So I sometimes struggle with I don't know what to call it but it's both. Whatever people can recognize, it's the same powerhouse.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:24):\nOkay. Cool. I'm glad I'm not the only one that's confused. But 37signal is the current name. Great.\n\nRyan Singer (01:33:29):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:30):\nSo you said that it felt like you left and it was like this bubble you got out of. Was there like a moment where you're like, \"You wrote this book. Everyone...\" You're like, \"Hey, this is how you should work,\" and then you're like, \"Oh, wait. This doesn't actually work in real life for a lot of people.\"? Is there a moment there?\n\nRyan Singer (01:33:44):\nIt wasn't that this doesn't work, I was just in a foreign country. It was like we tried it and it didn't work. One of the common things I would hear is the projects kept running over. \"We weren't finishing them at the end of the cycle. They kept running over and running over.\" And then, I would be like, \"Huh. So can you show me your shaping work?\" And then, they would show me a PRD and I'd be like, \"That doesn't look like what's in the book.\" And again like, \"Can you show me your shaping work?\" And they'd show me like a bunch of Figma files.\n\n(01:34:21):\nAnd then, what I started to understand was like we have some people in a role who were used to making a certain artifact at a certain step and they just kept doing that. And I didn't appreciate... It took me a while to realize like, \"There's no engineer in the picture here.\" And it was when we started to actually do the course, I said... Well, I did actually a couple projects where I helped teams hands-on and I learned that they...\n\n(01:34:50",

Well, I did actually a couple projects where I helped teams hands-on and I learned that they...\n\n(01:34:50):\nIt was the first actually consulting project that I did where I helped a team who was stuck. And what we did was we chose the engineer who was best suited to come over to product and be there in the shaping. And that was the moment when it was like, \"Ah. Now, I'm in the world I know again,\" when we had all of that mixed in the same room again. And so, that was kind of like... That was really something... I mean, it was a total learning curve for me and there's a lot of things like that. But that was, for example, a really big one. It's like, \"Oh, we have to get engineering in there.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:24):\nYou're the type of guest I most love having on this podcast, because you basically work with many, many companies, study what's working, what's not. You're not in the clouds pontificating about something. You're working with teams to make things better. And then, you take all of that learning, put it into a book, and share with us all. And so, the ROI is just incredible for us all because you've spent so much time doing this and you've actually done the work. You're not just in theory about it. So this is amazing. But we're not done yet. One question I wanted to ask is, Jason was tweeting that there's... He's working on a follow-up Shape Up book. What's happening there? Are you involved in that? What's the story?\n\nRyan Singer (01:36:06):\nSo I also saw the tweet. And I have to admit, I was a little surprised when I saw this tweet, but I had had a conversation with Jason a year earlier. And he reached out and he said, \"Hey, we're thinking about doing a second edition of the book.\" And my first reaction... Imagine, I was actually really in the middle of learning all these things that teams need to learn in order to catch up to what was natural for Basecamp to do. And so, for me, it was like, \"Interesting. I have a lot of new things. I have a lot of new ideas. Maybe collaborating on the second edition could make sense.\"\n\n(01:36:46):\nBut what I understood was that what he wanted to do was to make an updated version of how they work, because that's always been a big thing of how... I should use the right name, 37signals, of how they market and also how they lead is they like to really show a clear example. Not like, \"This is how you could do it. This is how some people do it,\" but like, \"This is how we do it.\"\n\n(01:37:09):\nAnd I think it's their strength that they are very, very clear like, \"This is how we do it and take it or leave it.\" What I understood was that if I did another version of the book that was just how Basecamp does it, I think it would leave so much opportunity on the table. Like there's so many people where what they need to learn is more like, \"How can it come closer to where I am? If I have the wall today between product and engineering, how do I bring the right people together into a shaping session? How do we actually do that? How do I overcome all of these little challenges because this is so far from our current way of working?\"\n\n(01:37:44):\nSo the work that I'm doing with, for example, with shaping in real life is all about those gaps. And then, I don't know what's going to be in the second edition because they are... I guess someone there is going to be working on that. But what I'm guessing is it's going to be an update on kind of, \"Up on top of the mountain over here, this is what Basecamp is doing.\" So hopefully, it'll be a cool thing to look at as like, \"Here's a model of what they're doing.\" And then the question is, \"What can I take from that and what do I need in order to actually be able to make it work in the real situation I'm in?\" And that's kind of where... Well, that's my focus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:20):\nThis is so interesting. Thank you for sharing. It sounds like a fork. You forked it and these are going potentially in different directions but inspired by each other.\n\nRyan Singer (01:38:29):\nMm-hmm. Totally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:30):\nSo interesting. Ryan, is there anything else that you want to share before we wrap up?\n\nRyan Singer (01:38:37):\nOne thing I could throw out there is sometimes people reach out to me because their projects aren't shipping, there's a lot of struggle, there's a lot of lack of clarity. But the root cause is actually that the input at the very beginning of the process is too unclear or... Like we don't actually know what's important to customers or we're not actually sure where the value is or this kind of a thing. So there is this link, this framing step that we talked about of, \"What is really the problem?\", before we go into shaping.\n\n(01:39:11):\nThis is the link to product strategy also.

And this is the place where it can be really useful to reach for a lot of, for example, Bob Moesta stuff with the Jobs-to-be-Done and the demand-side work, trying to get clear about big... So that's the tool that I reach for at that phase. And you can think of kind of this... Before the problem definition, there's this question of like, \"What's the demand? Where are people struggling? Where is really the place, the itch they're trying to scratch?\n\n(01:39:42):\nAnd then, a lot of the Shape Up stuff is kind of when I have something where I think there's an opportunity or I think there's something meaningful there because of what we learned from customers or the job to be done, research, or whatever it was. Now, how do I turn that into something that we can actually go do and ship in a reasonable amount of time? That's the supply side. That's where the Shape Up part fits in. So maybe it just might be cool for people to see a link there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:06):\nThat's a great plug for a Bob Moesta episode. We talked in-depth about the Jobs-to-be-Done framework and how to actually apply it. What's the book you'd recommend there? It sounds like basically it's like Shape Up plus this book gives you a lot.\n\nRyan Singer (01:40:19):\nActually, the one that I recommend the most is Demand-Side Sales 101 and it's funny because it's like sales. Especially for a product person, you're like, \"I'm the product person, not the sales person.\" But it's such a good dive into, \"What are people really trying to solve?\" And getting into that mindset of, \"What's the struggle? What's the problem?\" I think that's a really good entry point for that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:43):\nYeah. I don't love that title. I feel like you could have done better there with that book's title because-\n\nRyan Singer (01:40:48):\nIt's-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:49):\nYeah.\n\nRyan Singer (01:40:50):\nWhat's interesting about it is that it's very, very pointy for like if you are trying to make progress on sales, then it's this other kind of sales, this demand side sales. So I think maybe it's more for us who are kind of using it for different purposes. Like we're the product people trying to pull something out of it. That it's a little bit less aligned, but it's still useful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:11):\nYeah. But basically it's like the Jobs-to-be-Done book is what-\n\nRyan Singer (01:41:15):\nYeah. It's kind of like the Jobs-to-be-Done book that's a bit more tactical. If you're really curious about the general spirit of Jobs-to-be-Done, then Competing Against Luck is a really good intro. That's the one that Clay Christensen wrote with a lot of... I think there's a lot of stuff that Bob worked on that's in there. But for a little bit more tactical like, \"What's it look like to do the interview? And how to think about the struggling moment?\" and stuff like that, this Demand-Side Sales is good for this strategy stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:44):\nAwesome. And we'll also link to this episode where you could get the gist of it in one hour's time.\n\nRyan Singer (01:41:48):\nOh, that's right. You did... That episode was great by the way. That's... Yeah-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:52):\nThanks, Ryan. Thanks, Ryan. Okay. We did it. This was amazing. I think this is going to help so many people-\n\nRyan Singer (01:41:58):\nWe got through it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:58):\nWe're not done yet. Two final questions for you. Where can folks find the book, find you if they want to work with you? Anything else that you want to share? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nRyan Singer (01:42:08):\nWell, they can find me at my website. That's ryansinger.co. I'm also on X on RJS. I'm on LinkedIn. So just reach me there. And how can people be useful to me? I love hearing from people who are having these problems. If you're having these problems where it's like, \"Things are dragging,\" or, \"We can't see the end and we're not getting the quality we need,\" and all this stuff like man. I mean, this is how I learned all this stuff is by talking to people who are in it. So even if it's not clear what's the next step yet. If that problem is real, it would be cool to hear about it. I'd love to chat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:46):\nBe careful what you wish for about Moesta. He was just on the podcast and he told me he's got over a hundred LinkedIn DMs with people sharing their struggles with their job search. So here you go.\n\nRyan Singer (01:42:57):\nOh, yeah. Job moves, that's a big one. I think that's a broad appeal. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky",

He was just on the podcast and he told me he's got over a hundred LinkedIn DMs with people sharing their struggles with their job search. So here you go.\n\nRyan Singer (01:42:57):\nOh, yeah. Job moves, that's a big one. I think that's a broad appeal. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:01):\nYeah. That's true. I'm going to ask you to explain that when you do consulting work, just like how does that work? Who's that for? Just because I know that's something else you do.\n\nRyan Singer (01:43:10):\nSo it basically starts with uh, either often first CPO or CTO often reaches out first. And when it works well is when we actually get them together and then they understand that they need to change something or we have like a head of product and a head of engineering, that kind of a thing. If those two are both seeing eye to eye that there's a problem, then we can start a conversation around, \"Okay. So who would be the right people for a pilot team? What are the things that are going on business-wise that could be a good pilot project?\"\n\n(01:43:41):\nAnd then, I can help to figure out like, \"How do we actually...\" So almost like guiding through, like narrowing down that pilot project framing so that they have the support that it's going to be successful in shaping. And then, coaching the team so that they actually learn those shaping skills so that they can get through a session and come out with much more clarity. Like how do they actually run those sessions.\n\n(01:44:03):\nSo it's kind of first working with leadership, \"Who do we need to get to do this work? Who are the right people? How do we bring them into a pilot project?\" Narrowing down, doing some framing work on the pilot, so it's going to be clearer in the shaping. And then, giving some guidance on how to get through that shaping with some feedback rounds. This is usually a good approach.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:22):\nAmazing.

There was this perception that some people were intrinsically really good at strategy and others were not. It was almost as if there was a strategy gene you needed to be born with to be good at it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):\nSay someone's sitting down, okay, I'm going to start developing a strategy for our product. Where do you begin? What does this process look like?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:00:23):\nIn terms of what product strategy is? There is a smallest flavor of it which focuses on solving problems, they're called present forward, and it typically operates in a two-year horizon. We use a five-stage process to get there and it takes about eight to 12 weeks. The reason I think this process works is there is a ton of alignment built in. It goes back to human psychology of just something that comes from you, feels a lot more familiar and easy to accept.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):\nLet's talk about big S strategy. When should you approach strategy this way?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:00:53):\nThere's this interesting quote by Elon Musk, which is-\n\nElon Musk (00:00:56):\n\"Life's got to be about more than just solving problems.\"\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:00:58):\nI think this is true of every sort of company. There needs to be an aspirational and cool component to strategy. What does the product look like in five to 10 years? Why is the world better in 10 years? And what is the most exciting version of that view?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):\nToday my guest is Chandra Janakiraman. Chandra is chief product officer and executive vice president at VRChat. He was a product leader at Meta, chief product officer at Headspace, a GM at Zynga, and a senior PM at Amazon. And the way this podcast episode happened was an avid podcast listener, Karthik Suresh, told me about Chandra at a community meetup. And when I connected with Chandra, it was clear that I needed to get him on the podcast.\n\n(00:01:40):\nChandra is a student of strategy and has spent his career developing what he calls an operator's guide to strategy, which essentially pulls together the best ideas from Good Strategy, Bad Strategy, Playing to Win, Michael Porter and others to create a very clear, reliable and easy-to-follow five-step process to develop a great strategy and a set of next steps for your product and company. After hearing Chandra walk through this in our conversation, I'm basically going to now point everyone who wants to get better at strategy to this episode and Chandra's method. Strategy is at the heart of every great product and team and business, and it's also the source of so much pain if you do it badly. This episode is meant to help you avoid that. A big thank you to Karthik for making this connection. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Chandra Janakiraman.\n\n(00:02:39):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo.

I was at a meetup of my readership, of my community and someone came up to me and they're like, \"Lenny, you need to get this guy Chandra on your podcast. He's the most amazing playbook for developing a strategy.\" He's gone through it with you at a company he worked at with you once, and he's just like, \"People need to learn this because it's so good.\" And to me, if someone can get better at strategy, it feels like it just makes so much of the way the company operates and the way that people work better. So we chatted, we met, I was like, \"I completely agree. We definitely need to get you on this podcast to share your approach to the strategy.\" So we made this happen, and so we're here. So again, thank you for doing this and sharing.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:05:37):\nThank you. Thank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:39):\nFirst of all, I wanted to ask just you're very passionate about strategy and developing a way to consistently create great strategies. What got you so interested in this stuff in the first place? What kind of sparked your interest in this area?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:05:53):\nYeah, yeah, it's a very interesting story. It goes back all the way 10 years ago, but I remember it vividly like it happened yesterday. And I was a relatively new VP of product at Headspace, and we had this amazing company vision and mission that the founders had laid out, and I had come in and established goals for the team in terms of our key metrics, and we had a very buttoned up roadmap in my mind that fed into that company mission and vision. And I was feeling pretty good about how things were shaping up.\n\n(00:06:37):\nAnd on a particular Monday, the founder, CEO pulled me aside, and in his usual disarming style, he sort of made a short but profound statement. He said that, \"Hey, CJ, I'm hearing that a lot of people don't really understand why we are working on what we are working on,\" and that was it. That was really the extent of what he shared. And it was a little bit of a bubble bursting moment for me because we obviously had spent a lot of time building the plan and I was feeling relatively good about the plan.\n\n(00:07:21):\nAnd so I spoke to a few people. I sort of wanted to understand it a little bit deeper, like, \"Hey, what's happening?\" And he was right. He was right. A lot of people didn't really understand why we were working on the things we were working on, and it led to some soul-searching. And basically I was lucky because there was actually a board member of Headspace who had a product background, kind of knew what good looked like, and I came to the conclusion, \"Hey, we needed a strategy for Headspace.\"\n\n(00:07:56):\nSo with extensive work with her, with the board person, we built the first written product strategy for Headspace. And that, and the subsequent actions on the product led to a complete re-imagination of the product. And basically we were able to create a new product, we call it the Next Generation Headspace, which on one hand it could support a comprehensive library of content, not just meditation, but non-meditation content as well. It had the sort of home experience where everything was incredibly personalized for the individuals, and there were several motivational elements built into the whole product experience. And it was very transformational for the company and the product because it changed the product from being a meditation app to a broader health and wellness service and really put the company on a different trajectory. It led to my promotion to the first CPO at Headspace.\n\n(00:09:07):\nAnd most interestingly, I had a chance to, while going through it almost in a sort of out of body way, observed the process of like, okay, how did we put this thing together? And what actually went into it? What really started as almost a personal crisis moment of finding this need to create a strategy for a product and a company led to a bigger sort of quest for me, which is I started noticing that there was a certain mystique and aura about product strategy, and there was this perception that some people were intrinsically really good at strategy and others were not. And it was almost as if there was a strategy gene that you needed to be born with to be good at it. And that bothered me a lot, and I sort of wanted to ask myself, is it possible to break that divide between the haves and the have-nots and make this capability widely accessible through a procedural approach. And I have news for you. The answer is yes, anybody can build product strategy through a clear understanding of what it is and through a friendly and repeatable playbook.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:29):\nAmazing. That's exactly what I want to do here. The point you made about the why, I think everyone listening to this that's been in product for long enough has heard that of just, \"Your team doesn't understand why we're doing this.\" I've heard that a number of times, as much as you",

The point you made about the why, I think everyone listening to this that's been in product for long enough has heard that of just, \"Your team doesn't understand why we're doing this.\" I've heard that a number of times, as much as you think you're killing it, there's always that, you forget sometimes to do that or you aren't doing it great. And I love that basically the solution to that is the strategy solves that problem of helping people connect the dots and understand why this is the roadmap, why this is the strategy. Okay, so before we get into it, just one more context question, what's just the best way to think about what you're about to share and also who's it for? Who needs to hear this briefly?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:11:11):\nSo the way to think about this, the substance is that this is not a new framework or theory that I'm going to be talking about. There are plenty of excellent materials on strategy from ancient texts like The Art of War from Sun Tzu, all of Michael Porter's work, Good Strategy Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt, who's been on your podcast, Playing to Win Lafley and Roger Martin. So there's a ton of extensively researched and well-founded materials out there. So the way I would think about this is, it's more of an operator's interpretation of all the stuff that's out there and are able to package it into something that's friendly and repeatable, particularly for product people who think they are weak at strategy or perhaps have received such feedback.\n\n(00:12:05):\nAnd just in terms of the battle-tested nature of it, I personally use this playbook about five to six times tweaking and optimizing it each time based on what I thought worked, what people thought worked and didn't work, including several times at Meta and usually leading to strong results, both for me achieving senior leadership alignment as well as driving business results for the company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:36):\nOkay, I'm getting more and more excited. Let's get into it, let's get into this playbook. People hear this word strategy a lot. They're told be more strategic, build a better strategy. What's the simplest way to understand what is a strategy?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:12:49):\nYeah, let's start with some basic definitions, which is as you asked, what is product strategy? And if you think back to the Headspace example, this sort of comes to life as well. So product strategy, strategy sits between the mission and vision and the plan. It could be at the company level or at the team level, but it's usually sitting between the mission and vision and the plan. And the plan, you can call the plan the roadmap, which is basically an ordered list of things that you want to get done and the mission and vision is basically sort of the purpose of existence, what does it look like when you achieve your purpose of existence? So it sits between the two and it forces choice to deploy scarce resources to generate maximum impact.\n\n(00:13:40):\nAnd I want to borrow an analogy from the world of physics. There is this concept called resonance, and the concept of resonance is really interesting, and it's actually very close to the concept of strategy. So the concept of resonance works as follows, when you apply a certain frequency to an object and you get pretty close to its natural frequency, you see a disproportionate increase in the amplitude of how that object vibrates. And so it's very interesting, if you apply any other frequency, there's very little effect on the object, but if you get close to its natural frequency, there's this exponential increase in the vibration of the product. So this concept of resonance is interesting.\n\n(00:14:27):\nSo the way to think about it in the context of strategy is, it is selecting that frequency to achieve resonance between the product and the market. And so when you get close to that frequency, you should see tremendous impact in terms of the product landing well in the market. And so that's how I would think about it. It sits between mission, vision and the plan. It forces choice to deploy scarce resources to generate maximum impact, so using resonance as a sort of an example, and it ideally includes three components. The first is a handful of areas to focus on and I call these strategic pillars and then a whole bunch of areas that are explicitly not the focus. And the third component is why. So why are the focus areas, A, B and C? Why are these whole bunch of areas not the focus? And that's the three components. That's really it in terms of product strategy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:32):\nI love it. And I love the things we aren't doing as a core part of this, that comes up a lot on this podcast of being clear is what we're not going to do. We know these could be things we could do, but we're deciding we're not doing these things.\n\n(00:15:42):\nOkay, so let's just talk through how you go about developing a strategy using this method. Say someone's sitting down, \"Okay, I'm going to start developing a strategy for our product.\" Where do you begin? What does this process look like? Let's start talking through it.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:15:59):\nSo I sort of want to first explain this concept called smallest strategy, and I'll sort of talk about what that is and how it's different from another kind. But the basic sort of strategic process I would say takes about eight to 12 weeks long. It's something that I think people often underestimate how",

But the basic sort of strategic process I would say takes about eight to 12 weeks long. It's something that I think people often underestimate how long it takes and eventually end up taking a lot more time. But when they start off, they think, \"Oh, I could probably stand this up in a couple of weeks,\" but usually through iteration it actually ends up taking 8 to 12 weeks anyway. So it's good to start with setting clear expectations that it takes about eight to 12 weeks. And the way to justify the ROI on that is typically a strategy like this can be leveraged for about a couple of years. So relative to that sort of payback period, I think the investment is relatively small. So it's pretty healthy from that sense to manage expectations and say that that's how long it's going to take.\n\n(00:17:00):\nSo within that period, there are five phases. There's the preparation phase, there's a strategy sprint, the design sprint, the document writing and the rollout. And those are the five phases, which I'll explain how one would go through. And basically each of them has a certain sort of time recommendation. For example, the preparation phase I would say is probably about four weeks. The strategy sprint is up to about one week. The design sprint is another one week, document writing maybe one to two weeks, and the rollout is maybe two to three weeks. So that's how you get to that range of eight to 12 weeks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:40):\nEssentially it's like a quarter of work to get to a final great strategy. And of these five phases, the biggest bucket is preparation, which to me sounds like it's not like a full-time team thing. It's starting to gather data and user research-\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:17:56):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:57):\nAs you talk through this, I'm curious just how much of the team is involved in each of these steps. But I think it's an important point, if you want a really good winning strategy, you need to give a time. You can't just say, \"In a month or a week, we need to develop a strategy, go figure it out, write this document.\" Great. Cool. So let's talk about step one preparation.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:18:14):\nThat's correct, Lenny. And I think you, if I forget, remind me that sometimes there is pressure. There's just business pressure, like the CEO might still want a strategy in two weeks, how do you respond to that? And I think we can find some clever shortcuts there, but I think to the extent possible, the leader should push for [inaudible 00:18:39] to make something really great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:40):\nAnd I think part of it is that as a leader, you can start on this before... you know this is coming, so you should get started before it's even asked for.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:18:48):\nThat's correct.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:49):\nYeah, awesome. Okay, let's get into it.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:18:51):\nSo I think you sort of touched on this in terms of the preparation phase being the longest phase, but also not being sort of like a full-time thing. So that's absolutely right. So the preparation phase is really... The way to start this, which is a little different from other approaches I've seen from people is to actually form a strategy working group. This is an important concept. So the strategy working group is sort of a small team. It typically consists of engineering, product design and data at a minimum. And in certain cases, there's a luxury to have other functions like product marketing, user research, that's also part of the strategy working group. But the minimum quorum, I would recommend is engineering, product design and data because design in some ways represents both sort of product design and user research. So you do get the voice of the user from that perspective. And typically the PM is driving the strategy working group and the process, but that working group is actually the team that's going to collaboratively create the strategy doc.\n\n(00:19:59):\nAnd so in the preparation phase, there's usually a kickoff meeting where the PM pulls the team together, talks about the purpose of the process, lays out the different phases, and gives everybody a feel for what's going to happen in the next 8 to 12 weeks. And basically then creates a list of very discrete action items and deliverables for each of the stakeholders in the working group. So specifically, there's an action item around aggregating all the behavioral insights that the team might have around the product. And usually this is a combination of previous analysis that the team has run on the data side and potentially also feature launches and how they have done. So all kind of analytical analysis.\n\n(00:20:50):\nThe ask is really to create a meta analysis of all of the analysis. So the data person on the strategy working group has to scan the historical archives at the company and sort of synthesize and condense that into a very sort of digestible macro themes and learnings about users. So that's sort of one preparation phase item.\n\n(00:21:16):\nThe second is UXR insight. So again, there's probably a lot of soft hard signals about users, not",

So the data person on the strategy working group has to scan the historical archives at the company and sort of synthesize and condense that into a very sort of digestible macro themes and learnings about users. So that's sort of one preparation phase item.\n\n(00:21:16):\nThe second is UXR insight. So again, there's probably a lot of soft hard signals about users, not just based on research that's run by user researchers, but also potentially from the customer service team, social channels, and basically a meta analysis of all of that into one very actionable and synthesized deck on all the insights on users. That's usually led by the design person and with support from their research team. And that's sort of the second action item.\n\n(00:21:53):\nThe third action item is leadership interviews. So I sort of have this fun story of the fruit with leadership strategy reviews, which I want to share. So imagine, this is sort of how sometimes strategy reviews go, which is you bring a fruit to the reviewer and say, \"Hey, here's a mango, what do you think?\" And the reviewer says, \"I actually don't like mangoes.\" And you're like, \"Oh,\" you're sort of sad. You take it back, you bring an apple and you show, \"Hey, what do you think of an apple?\" And then the leader says, \"I actually stopped eating apples last year.\" And so you're disappointed again. You go back, you bring a banana. \"I hated bananas since I was a kid.\" And so it's a bit of a silly caricature of reviews, but there's a bit of grain of truth there, which is, imagine how frustrating that is for both the reviewer and the person who's reviewing.\n\n(00:22:54):\nAnd so it could be made so much better if you just engage with your leaders before you actually build a strategy. It's amazing how few people actually do that. And so the fruit story tells you, hey, imagine if you just asked the reviewer, \"Do you even like fruits?\" How much better the experience would've been for both parties. And so leadership interviews are a very important part of a strategy formulation process. So you can divide and conquer, there's several leaders, like you assign different leaders to different people on the strategy working group and each of them sort talks to that leader. And there are a few questions that I would recommend asking, and it's basically, what does success feel like for the leader? What does failure look like? What is the measure of success? What are principles to keep in mind while going through this process?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:51):\nAnd these are centered around the product that you're working on?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:23:55):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:55):\nFor Headspace, it'd be like, what do you think success looks like for Headspace or the specific feature of Headspace? [inaudible 00:24:03].\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:24:02):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:03):\nOkay, cool.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:24:04):\nThat's right, yeah. And also I think ask them for their favorite or better ideas. It's actually what I've found through this process is a lot of leaders have these better ideas, they just feel shy to share it because they don't want their teams to think of them as micromanage-y. They want their teams to figure out the answer themselves, but then when you ask them, they actually have a pet idea always.\n\n(00:24:29):\nAnd so asking them just takes the mystery out of it. And it also gives them a creative avenue. So some people feel nervous about engaging senior leaders in these conversations in the sense that, hey, is it a waste of their time? What I've found is the exact opposite, senior leaders are, they welcome this because one, it's actually a more fun conversation for them than the other meetings that they have in their day because they're getting a little bit of their creative juices going, and they actually feel happy that somebody actually asked them what they're feeling and thinking about. And so it's actually very, very positive energy when you ask leaders just what they want. And it's also not a sign of weakness. It's actually a sign of strength and humility to ask your leaders what you want. And so keeping that fruit story in mind, I want to just say that this is a very, very positive thing, a very powerful thing.\n\n(00:25:26):\nThe next area is competitive analysis. So if there is a product marketing person, they can do it for you. If there isn't, the PM should do it themselves. And basically the idea is you try to understand who are the comparables or the competitors in the space, and you sort of build a little bit of a head-to-head and sort a stack chart of where's everybody going and what are of the angles of investment for different people based on the explicit signals, which is what are they releasing?\n\n(00:25:59):\nYou don't really know what their strategies are, but you can kind of tell when you look at the features they're putting out that, oh, they seem to be focusing on this particular area. And so that's sort of competitive analysis. And bigger companies, there's also another important input, which is adjacent roadmaps. Are the teams adjacent to you and what are they investing in? Because oftentimes that can have a rub-off effect on your team, and if you're not aligning with other key teams, it's going to be important. So adjacent roadmaps and a summary of that.\n\n(00:26:33):\nAnd last but not least",

So adjacent roadmaps and a summary of that.\n\n(00:26:33):\nAnd last but not least, is what I call user observation. So I like the strategy working group to actually either interview a user or watch a video and report key learnings. And the idea is not to action those insights, it's really to build empathy. When you get somebody in the room with a user, it just changes their mind, it softens them a little bit. It gets them out of their own preconceived notions of what to build, what the strategy should be and...\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:27:00):\n... their own preconceived notions of what to build, what the strategy should be, and it humanizes the whole process. That I think is the purpose, but you still give them the homework of writing down what they learned because it's a little bit of a forcing function.\n\n(00:27:16):\nThe output of all of this is what I call the comprehensive preparation readout. It is a single master deck where you sort of have the behavioral insights meta analysis, you have the UXR insights meta analysis, you have a download of the leadership interviews, you have the competitive stack charts, you have the adjacent roadmaps, and you have a section on user observations. It's a lot of work, but to your point, it can be done in parallel with your day jobs. You can multitask, and that's why you take about four weeks to do that. That sort of concludes the preparation phase. You get the deck, and that rolls into the strategy sprint, which is the next phase. I want to pause and see if you have any questions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:06):\nYeah, I have a million questions, but I'm going to keep myself contained. Just to quickly summarize. Basically you kick off, we're going to start developing strategy for this product, and you were going to touch on this, but it may help just to talk about this right now. I know you have big S Strategy, small S strategy. This process, what's an example of the level of product scale that this process is for? Because I know you have another approach for a larger scale of a product, basically for a company. What's the best way to think about small S strategy, which is what we're going through?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:28:37):\nYeah, I think it's a good question, Lenny. I would say that the process works well at sort of a growth stage company or in a vertical within sort of a larger company. I think it scales pretty well. The main difference between this small S and big S is the time horizon aspect and the aspirational component, which we'll get to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:02):\nOkay, so this is a process you can use for entire company strategy of not a large company, not a massively, and then also just a product within a company?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:29:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:11):\nOkay, perfect. Okay. Hey, we're kicking off strategy for this thing. Let's say VR Chat 2.0. You have this kickoff meeting with your working group. You assign action items and there's six things you ask everyone to do. Gather all the behavioral insights, all the user research insights that you've had, leadership interviews, interview people, ask what they want and see what they're hoping for, what success looks like, competitive analysis, adjacent roadmaps across other teams and user observations, just like watch users, see what's happening. You assign each of these tasks to different people in this working group. You set a deadline. We have to present this in say, four weeks. People go work on it. You meet ongoing as it's coming together, and then the output is a deck that you share. Do you share this deck with just that working group, or who do you share this deck with and read it out to?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:30:02):\nYeah. The deck is an output of the first phase, and then it flows into the second phase, which is a strategy sprint. You don't share the deck with anybody yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:10):\nGot it. This is our secret.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:30:11):\nIn the strategy sprint, it's like a key thing. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:13):\nAwesome. Okay. I love how very concrete and actionable this is with time boxes and action items and the exact output you're looking for. I love this. Okay, cool. Basically what you're trying to do here is gather all of the input that will inform the strategy.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:30:27):\nThat's correct.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:28):\nIt's giving yourself time to do this, because if you think about it, the output is determined by the quality of your input. I love, it feels like a core component of this method is spend time creating, gathering all the input, all the best input, actually spend time there. Don't just make it a half-assed last minute thing. Okay. Amazing. Okay, let's talk about step two, which is the strategy sprint.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:30:52):\nYeah, so the strategy sprint is the",

Don't just make it a half-assed last minute thing. Okay. Amazing. Okay, let's talk about step two, which is the strategy sprint.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:30:52):\nYeah, so the strategy sprint is the heart of the process. This is sort of where you make the decision. If you recall, the definition of strategy is it forces choice to deploy resources into a few areas for maximum impact. The core of strategy is really picking those areas and the areas you're not going invest in. That happens in the strategy sprint, so really it's the heart of the process.\n\n(00:31:22):\nTypically, it's like a three to five day process. The first day is the share out date. Everybody has done some great work. They go in, they share what they've collected, what they've sort of learned. It brings everybody in the working group to the same state of understanding, the same state of consciousness on the state of the union. That's a great process where what I encourage people to do is write down things that you are, as you're listening, write down things that you find are problems for our users, things that are coming in the way of our growth and things that are sort of suboptimal for the business.\n\n(00:32:05):\nPeople take a lot of notes during that time and the people who are presenting are sharing everything they've learned. That's really day one. It's just absorbing a ton of information and writing down a ton of notes so people can kind of understand where all the problems are. It's a very problems focused process, and that's an important point. I'll get back to it when we talk about big S, which is different. Once people have that common awareness, shared knowledge of all the problems, day two is literally the most important day in the entire 8 to 12 weeks because that's where you actually make the choice. The way to flow through it, it's actually really important to flow through it correctly. The first step is really generating a whole bunch of problems, because people have been taking notes the previous day.\n\n(00:32:59):\nYou start the day with, \"Hey, let's collect everybody's thoughts on what the problems are that are holding us back.\" It's a free flowing session. Everybody throws out their observations on what's holding us back, and you just capture all of that in a Google Sheets, for example. Over even an hour, you start to see these patterns emerging of like, there's these clusters of problems that are really holding us back. The next step is you do a joint clustering of related problems and you create these potentially, typically in my experience, I've seen about 10 to 15 clusters form of very related problems. The beauty of it is each of those bigger cluster, you actually know what the sub problems are within that cluster because you sort of generated it very organically.\n\n(00:33:55):\nThen you have, let's say 10 to 15 clusters. What you then do is you, because remember, because it started as a problem generation exercise, each of the clusters also has a name that is a problem, and so the next step is to flip it into an opportunity framing. Let me give you a couple of examples.\n\n(00:34:16):\nLet's say there's a bunch of problems around people don't really know where to find different things in our product, and they don't really know where to go, where to find a certain feature or a certain experience. There's let's say a lot of problems in that area, so difficulty finding things becomes the cluster, the problem cluster and discovery becomes the opportunity sort of framing of it. It's sort of the more positive framing of it.\n\n(00:34:46):\nAnother example could be that people get a lot of content that they don't like. They see a lot of stuff that they don't like, and so they disengage with the product. The opportunity framing of that would be relevance. It's basically stuff that really matters to me. Maybe if it's a social product, then maybe people are finding it difficult to find friends and they are lonely because of that. The opportunity framing would be social connection.\n\n(00:35:20):\nFlipping all of those problem clusters into positive framing and opportunity framing is the next step. Then you're in a great spot because now all you have to do is you have to down select from those 10 to 15 opportunity areas into ideally three, maybe five, but I would recommend three because it creates more clarity and focus. The way to do that is really sort of ranking them on, I would say four or five key dimensions or criteria, and the first is expected impact.\n\n(00:35:56):\nLet's say you actually tackle that area. What is the expected impact to whatever matters to you as a company, as a business, as a product? The second dimension is certainty of impact. Certainty of impact is basically how concrete is the evidence that this is a problem? Sometimes you have really hard data, sometimes you have more anecdotal evidence, and so the confidence really depends on how big the problem's sizing and frequency is. Expected impact, certainty of impact. The third one is also very important, which is clarity of levers.\n\n(00:36:34):\nDo you actually have an idea of how you would solve it? If you don't, it's going to be really difficult to move the needle on it because you should kind of know that, okay, I can imagine these solutions could actually move the needle. I can actually launch this sort of nudge system that can help people find things. I can recommend people. I can recommend friends so that people can form",

I can actually launch this sort of nudge system that can help people find things. I can recommend people. I can recommend friends so that people can form friends quicker on the platform. You should have a sense of how you would solve that particular space. Is there clarity on levers? That's the third dimension.\n\n(00:37:08):\nThe fourth dimension is super important, which is are the levers unique and differentiated to that particular team or company? Which is that if another team or company could build it better than this particular team or company, then it's probably not that differentiated. It's probably going to be pretty generic once you launch it. It's a combination of sort of like, is there a lot of impact here? How confident are we of the problem? Do we have a sense of the solutions? And basically, are we the team or company that has the capabilities and the skills to uniquely build it where other teams cannot?\n\n(00:37:52):\nOnce you have that, and sometimes what happens is you don't have too much data, and so it's okay to have qualitative scores on this like high, medium, low, T-shirt scores, whatever that is. The key is you're doing it together as a strategy working group, and you're debating the scores and you're reasoning why it should be higher versus lower. There's a ton of alignment and collision that's happening when you're doing that, which is very healthy for the eventual outcome.\n\n(00:38:22):\nOnce you do that, basically you can do a simple sort of addition of the scores and a sort, and what you have is basically the top three and you have the remaining 7 or 12 that are basically not the focus. That's the core of the process, is getting those opportunity areas and getting to a shared sense of how do we prioritize them and why?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:51):\nOkay, and this is all done in a week. I know there's more to it. There's a couple more items that help you move from what you just said to the next step, but I love that this is the core of the biggest element of the process, and you do it in a week and you're only able to do it in a week because of the work you did ahead of time. Again, highlighting the importance of that prep step.\n\n(00:39:13):\nJust to share what you've shared so far, and then we'll finish the strategy sprint step. It's basically do the share out so everyone's on the same page about all the information that, all the inputs essentially. Enumerate all the problems, like individual small problems and then cluster them into 10 to 15 problem clusters. Flip it from here's the problem to here's an opportunity we have. Rank them based on, basically there's these four attributes you shared, which I'll actually, I wrote these down. Impact potential, confidence that it will have the impact, clarity of levers and are they differentiated unique levers? Is there something different from what other folks are doing? Those are ways to rank these ideas and problem clusters. You essentially come up with, here's three bets basically we potentially should take. Okay, and then I think that's where you stopped. Is that right?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:40:03):\nThat's totally right, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:06):\nOkay, cool.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:40:06):\nThose three that are at the top of that pile are basically our strategic pillars. We've sort of gotten our strategic pillars and they basically hold up the strategy. That's why they're called strategic pillars. The idea is once you have the strategic pillars, we basically translate that into a few how might we's? Let's say it's a relevance thing. How might we find the best content for a particular user? How might we surface it in the right place? There's a few how might we's, and the how might we's are basically intended to help the next phase of the process, which is the design sprint.\n\n(00:40:43):\nYou generate these areas, these strategic pillars, you generate the how might we's. How might we's are typically pretty straightforward. Once you have the strategic pillars, it takes probably an hour to generate some how might we's for each of them, maybe two or three for each strategic pillar, and then you're done with that stage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:00):\nI just want to highlight real quick, this phrasing is really important. I used exactly the same phrasing. I had a PM that I worked with and his name was Andrew Chen, but not the Andrew Chen people know about, that's an investor, who had this concept of fertile questions that create ideas and spark ideas and solutions. This phrase, \"How might we\", is actually really powerful as a way to come up with ideas to solve problems. It's just like, how might we increase discoverability in our app? How might we improve relevance? There's something magical about that phrasing that it opens up your mind to, how might we? Let's think about it. Versus like, how do we improve discovery? That's a different, your brain works differently hearing this. That is a really powerful phrasing. Just wanted to highlight that.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:41:47):\nYeah, that's awesome. It's also something that designers are familiar with, Lenny, so it flows really well into sort of a design sprint.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:",

It's also something that designers are familiar with, Lenny, so it flows really well into sort of a design sprint.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:56):\nOkay, so you have these how might we'd. You have three pillars, maybe three or four or five how might we's to solve these opportunities/problems, and then what happens after that?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:42:06):\nExactly. Then the third day is it's good to start fresh. The team's accomplished a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:13):\nThis was all the first two days.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:42:14):\nThis is the first two days, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:15):\nWow. Okay. So much done in two days.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:42:18):\nYeah, exactly. The second day is particularly intense on the team, so it's good to give them a break, because it's a lot of really mental sort of wrestling, and so give the team a bit of a break. Then the third day is when people are a little bit refreshed, we get to winning aspiration. Winning aspiration is super interesting because it's a very creative exercise. You basically imagine in two years, because that's the typical time horizon of a smaller strategy, is like 18 months to 24 months. This is what I tell the team. Imagine two years there's a newspaper, there's a journalist that covers this work, and there's a newspaper article that comes out. I want you to imagine the progress on all these strategic pillars and what the headline of that newspaper article looks like. It's called a newspaper headline approach.\n\n(00:43:09):\nBasically, everybody generates a newspaper headline in parallel. It's interesting because you often see there's these common themes that sort of form when people generate these headlines. The forcing function with the headline is also that it has to be somewhat simple and plain speak. It's not too technical. You have to get to a more simple layperson's language and you have to get to the key benefit that ultimately, the impact it has on the world. Those kinds of themes come up often.\n\n(00:43:44):\nThen you do a little bit, you put them all into a blender, you put all of those headlines from the team into a blender, and you mash them together and create the winning aspiration, which is ultimately what does progress on the strategy look like in a couple of years time? That comes from the working group, it's not like one person writing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:09):\nWhat's an example of an aspiration that you've come up with on a project you worked on, a winning aspiration?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:44:14):\nWe did this process for the privacy team when I was at Meta. Really the strategic pillars were around a lot of features that we would build, but the winning aspiration was really like, could we move consumer trust? The newspaper headline is something like, \"Facebook has moved the needle on consumer trust by investing in these areas.\" That's how you create the bigger impact.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:47):\nThat's a great example. Obviously this is similar to the PR Amazon method and what I love about your approach, as you said early on, is you're just pulling together all of these awesome ideas from all these different methods of strategy work to a very methodical step-by-step process. Taking all the best ideas into, and as you described, an operator's playbook for doing this. I love that. Okay. When you say blender, by the way, I was thinking as you were talking, put them into a blender, what I'm inferring is you just take everyone's headlines and you come up with one that kind of covers the gamut of all three pillars being successful.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:45:20):\nThat's exactly right. More tactically what I typically do is I put them all on a slide and start, it's almost like a word cloud, and then you start to see these common words. Then you converge those words as the key elements of the final winning aspiration. Then you try to create a nice statement out of that. It also symbolically, everybody sees their own statement on the deck, and that's how you get to the final model.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:46):\nAwesome. I feel like AI could help with that now.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:45:46):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:48):\nJust put in all your headline ideas and it comes up with some suggestions. Okay, cool. Is that the end of the sprint or is there more to the sprint?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:45:55):\nThat's it for the sprint.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:57):\nOkay. At the end of the sprint, what do you have? What are the outputs?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:46:00):\nYeah, this is a great progress on strategy because now we have the three strategic pillars. We have the how might we associate it with the strategic pillars. You also have the why. Why did you get to those three strategic pillars and what are you not focused on and what are the reasons for it? You also have the winning aspiration. It's great progress. The team's done a great job. I think now we sort of move",

Why did you get to those three strategic pillars and what are you not focused on and what are the reasons for it? You also have the winning aspiration. It's great progress. The team's done a great job. I think now we sort of move on to the design sprint.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:30):\nIn your experience, how often are these three the correct three that you end up going with versus you learn something over the course of the rest of the sprint and adjust?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:46:38):\nIt's a very good question. We'll speak about an example that I had in Meta where typically during the strategy sprint, you don't change it once you go through the strategy sprint, but eventually there are a lot of signals you get through execution where you sort of have to course correct. We'll talk about one very interesting example of how that sort of changed things here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:01):\nAwesome. Okay. Basically, you've developed your strategy at this point, and in your experience it ends up being... Until you hit the market and test, you don't really know what's going on.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:47:01):\nCorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:10):\nBut there's kind of an implication that in your experience doing this, I think you said five or six times, it has been correct and as good as doing it any other approach.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:47:21):\nI would say it's not sort of an empirical study, obviously because of the small sample size, but I would say that it's really opened people's eyes and it's led to really good alignment and eventually good results. Even when it has not, it has led to good organizational buy-in on why and how we are approaching things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:42):\nThis reminds me of, Tomer Cohen was on the podcast, he's CPO of LinkedIn and he has this phrase that always says he says, which is, \"We may be wrong, but we're not confused.\" I love that a core part of this is everyone is completely on the same page, not from the beginning, but once you start this process of here's all the inputs, here's step by step we are working together on narrowing down, so at least everyone understands the why. Which is what sparked your interest in this in the first place, everyone understanding. I know there's a whole rollout at the end too to solve that.\n\n(00:48:14):\nOkay, cool, so we have the sprint. We have basically the three pillars that you're going to invest in, this headline of what it might look like if you're to launch and some solution ideas with how might we's. What comes next?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:48:26):\nYeah. The next phase is the design sprint, and the design sprint can be led by the design person who's in the strategy working group. If you remember, there's engineering, product design and data, so the design person can lead it and the PM can sort of take a bit of a backseat during this process. The input to the design sprint is sort of the three strategic pillars and the how might we's associated with it.\n\n(00:48:50):\nThe goal of the design sprint is not to sort of come up with these are the features we should build. That's not the purpose of the design sprint. The design sprint is to generate a lot of illustrative concepts that bring the strategy to life because a picture is worth a thousand words. Oftentimes, even though you might have the right words in your strategy doc, people might still scratch their head like, \"What do you exactly mean? What are you going to build?\" The illustrative concepts really sort of give people something to latch onto, \"Oh, okay, I get it. This is what you're going to build at the end of the day with this strategy.\"\n\n(00:49:25):\nThe more generative, the better. Then there's the ability to, sometimes if you do the Google Ventures design sprint, you can even test some of it with users and get a little bit of sharpening of things. The goal here is not to build feature-ready designs, it's more to generate concepts. Once you have that, basically the design sprint, and there's different flavors of design sprints, which I won't go into. You can lean on your design lead to decide what's the appropriate way, but the input and the output is what needs to be very emphasized. The input needs to be the strategic pillars. The output needs to be a ton of illustrative concepts to explain each strategic pillar. You could almost have a section where you talk about each strategic pillar and insert those concepts in that section. That's the idea.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:16):\nWe're going to go through a couple examples to make this very real. You mentioned the design sprint method, which we had the authors on the podcast. They actually didn't go through the design sprint method. They have another book called Make Time that's about productivity. We also had their colleague from Google Ventures that designed a bullseye sprint, which is also an interesting sprint. It's a new thing that helps you figure out your ICP and who to focus your product on and how that informs your product.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:50:40):\nOh, that's right. Interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:41):\nIt's another type of sprint you could use here. The input is here's the three things we're going to invest",

The output is here's concepts of what this could look like to get people's minds going. Is it just a bunch of mocks basically in a deck at this point?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:51:00):\nThat's correct. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:01):\nOkay, cool. Okay, amazing. That's a week. That's another sprint. PM could maybe take a little bit of a break.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:51:06):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:07):\nAnd designers take the lead.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:51:09):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:09):\nThe engineers are kind of inputs and thought partners in this, I imagine.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:51:13):\nThey're optional. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:15):\nOptional, but yeah, ideally they're involved because you want all the best ideas in there.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:51:19):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:20):\nOkay, cool. What comes next?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:51:21):\nThen the next step is the document writing. This is sort of a solo activity that the PM should take on, but the great news is the PM is not starting from scratch. There's so much great stuff to write. If you remember, there's a ton of user insights, a ton of behavioral insights, a ton of competitive analysis. There's the three strategic pillars, how might we's, winning aspiration. There's a whole bunch of illustrative concepts.\n\n(00:51:48):\nOftentimes, product leads have this sort of creator's block. That is solved here completely because you have a ton of great material. I have to tell you, it doesn't make the job easier. You still have to weave together a good story. That's why I think it takes a week or two. I think it's really about combining, connecting and editing at this point and telling a cohesive story from all those components, but I think the building blocks are really solid and defensible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:17):\nIs there a template or kind of sections you like to include in your strategy doc? As someone sits down and is trying to write this out, what do you want to see there as headings?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:52:26):\nI think you could almost take the building blocks as a little bit of a steer for the template. You start with the broader context where you talk about what the leaders kind of want from this overall effort. Then you get into key insights and analysis where you have user insights, behavioral insights, competitive analysis. Then you get into the strategic pillars and you explain them. You also explain why. In the appendix, you include the full table that you generated on day two of your strategy sprint. You include the full table in the appendix, including the criteria. That's going to be really important because most people are going to ask, \"Why did you pick these?\" That's basically sort of the defensibility.\n\n(00:53:17):\nThen you have the winning aspiration that's very bold. It's a big part of the heart of the deck, and you sort of embed the illustrative concepts into the actual each of the strategic pillars so that it flows well. Then finally, you end with some kind of alignment questions like, \"Hey, do these feel right? Are there things we are missing?\" So that it creates that framework for alignment in the subsequent meetings.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:45):\nI'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:53:52):\nYes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:54):\nWhat is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies, like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:00):\n... and to scale and watershed, I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.\n\nChristina (00:54:09):\nYes, so we just launched one scheme of file feeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes, as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder.\n\n(00:54:18):\nWe see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of without involving their engineering team at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:31):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap, and instead use something like OneSchema, and not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever?\n\nChristina (00:54:",

We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations.\n\n(00:54:55):\nWe have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:02):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us, and if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.\n\n(00:55:17):\nI pulled up Playing to Win, which I know you also pull ideas from, and actually Roger Martin was on the podcast talking about this stuff. And one way I think about it as you're describing a way to break up your strategy doc, is he has these five questions that you ask.\n\n(00:55:31):\nThe first is actually what's your winning aspiration? So I love that you're pulling that in. This is one approach your doc would be. What's your winning aspiration? Where will you play? What market are you going after? How will you win? What capabilities must be in place for you to win? And then what management systems are required?\n\n(00:55:46):\nWe'll link to this framework just in case people want that as a crutch in their thinking strategy, but is there anything that we could link folks to that describe how you like to think about this doc? And if not, it'd be cool if you make a template that folks could borrow.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:56:00):\nI'm happy to share of the flowchart of the process and the template as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:05):\nAwesome. Okay. So this is how long of a process, this writing of the document?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:56:10):\nIt's about one to two weeks, and I think it's mostly solo work and hopefully by the end of it there's a very tight doc, and that's what we use to roll out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:21):\nAnd by solo work, I imagine you're looping in this working team to get their feedback as you're pulling it together, or is it just you sit there in a room and then...\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:56:27):\nI would minimize pulling them in, because they've all contributed so much to the process already. So, I would say that at the end of it, obviously, once you have a draft, it's good to share with them, but I wouldn't tap their cycles too much at this point, because they've given a lot already.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:47):\nI see. Okay.\n\n(00:56:48):\nAnd how many pages do you see this doc being, roughly? What's a heuristic?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:56:52):\nIt's not too long. I would say probably three or four pages and then an appendix has a lot of additional... Like, the table I spoke about and a lot of additional maybe illustrative concepts. Maybe you can only use a few illustrative concepts in the main section so that there could be others there.\n\n(00:57:09):\nI think usually there's a desire from leaders to say, \"Okay, what are we building next?\" And it's important not to include a roadmap as part of a strategy doc, because a strategy doc is meant to be separate from the roadmap. It's meant to be a companion to your roadmap. And even though there's interest, maybe sometimes you can include a illustrative roadmap in the appendix, but I would try to keep it clean and try to keep it focused on just the strategy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:40):\nSo at this point you basically developed your strategy, the next step, I think you call rollout, where you just start actually rolling this out, so let's talk about that. But it's important to note how many weeks in this is. This is like six-ish weeks of work and you've got a strategy for your company/product?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:57:58):\nThat's exactly right. So I think you're probably in the last two to three weeks of the process, and pretty important final step is the rollout, and I would start with what I call gatekeepers. And these are people who are absolutely... You have to get their one-on-one alignment and blessing on this before it moves forward. And it's probably not too many, probably two or three people. So I would pre-flight it with them and get their alignment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:28):\nSo these are one-on-one meetings with these gatekeepers?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:58:29):\nThese are one-on-one meetings. Exactly.\n\n(00:58:31):\nAnd then there's a larger group of what I call key stakeholders, people who are impacted by it, different functional leaders, et cetera. And that can be done either async or through a group review. And then there's probably a rolling of list of team roadshows. There's different ways to do this,",

And that can be done either async or through a group review. And then there's probably a rolling of list of team roadshows. There's different ways to do this, but the one that I feel is most effective is the roadshow where you have about eight to 10 people in each session, so people feel more comfortable to ask questions and it's more conversational.\n\n(00:59:06):\nSo the purpose of this stage is to land it. It's not to seek too much feedback, so it's a delicate balance. At the same time, you don't want to appear just being too inflexible. So it's a very delicate balance. When people ask questions, you can clarify it, and you can add clarifications to the doc, but I wouldn't change... The most important thing, three strategic pillars, I wouldn't change that. I would defend it using the framework, but if people are like, \"there's really good arguments about the criteria that led to your ranking,\" then it's okay to reconsider it. I've not seeing it happen in my five to six attempts, but it's possible, theoretically possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:47):\nThe core of this approach it sounds like, is you've done a lot of the pre-work where you land in a generally correct place.\n\n(00:59:55):\nOkay, so this is the rollout. So what I'm thinking as you talk, say you're like a PM on a team, say you're working on privacy, it's like an IC, your ICPM, working on strategy. How do you think about including, say, your manager because through this process, when do you start to like, \"Hey, here's what we're planning, here's what we're thinking,\" making sure they're on board? Because I could see this working team off to the side working, working, working. \"Okay, we're ready to roll it out.\" Oftentimes there's like, \"No, wait. There's all this other stuff happening at the company, we don't have resources.\" Where do you loop them in? How do you think about that kind of stakeholder?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:00:29):\nThe the more attuned PMs who understand organizational dynamics, probably keep the manager pretty in sync through the process. I think, definitely, the manager becomes a person who you interview as part of the leadership interviews, so you know what the manager's looking for from the effort.\n\n(01:00:49):\nAnd then once you get to the strategic pillars on day two of the strategy sprint, you probably want to just quickly pre-flight it with the manager and say, \"Hey, look, this is how it's trending, and these are the things we are probably not going to do\" and any issues with that. And then eventually you actually want your manager to support you in some of these bigger meetings, so you enlist their help. So I would say that it's probably each individual style, but I would keep them pretty aligned through the process. But you don't have to be too heavy [inaudible 01:01:23], just be super light.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:24):\nGreat. Makes a lot of sense to me. There's like a...\n\n(01:01:26):\nWe're not going to solve everyone's problems with this one framework, maybe just quickly touch on resourcing. As you think about this. Like a part of a strategy includes like, oh, we also need these resources. Just any thoughts on how to include that? And then I want to get into some examples of how you've actually implemented this.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:01:42):\nSo I actually don't recommend thinking about resources in the strategy phase, because what you're saying is, \"these are the areas of focus\" and the resourcing question becomes more relevant from a road mapping standpoint.\n\n(01:01:55):\nBecause then you say, \"Okay, what percentage of our engineering do we put on strategic pillar A, versus B, versus C? And what are the specific things we build?\" So it becomes a road-mapping question as opposed to a strategy question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:08):\nAnd so by the end of this, the rollout, the part of the rollout is developing the actual roadmap. We're not going to get deep into that. That could be part two, solve every PM's problems, teach them all the steps of the process, but we're going to cut it off at, here's you have a strategy that is starting to be rolled out.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:02:24):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:25):\nCool.\n\n(01:02:25):\nLet's go through a couple examples where you actually move into this to make this even more real. I know there's a couple companies you were thinking about sharing, strategies you worked on.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:02:35):\nI think there's just three quick notes to close off this process and I'll share two examples, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:44):\nPerfect.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:02:46):\nSo the reason I think this process works, the first is because there is a ton of alignment built in within team alignment and leadership alignment built in. And it's not seen as, \"Oh, this PM went off and wrote this strategy doc and I don't agree with most of it.\" And part of this is actually very...\n\n(01:03:09",

And it's not seen as, \"Oh, this PM went off and wrote this strategy doc and I don't agree with most of it.\" And part of this is actually very...\n\n(01:03:09):\nIt goes back to human psychology of just something that comes from you, feels a lot more familiar and easy to accept. So this doc is actually not from the PM, the PM is facilitating it, but it's actually from the strategy working group. And the strategy working group are the leads of the team. And so it's actually... And the leadership inputs have been baked in, so it's actually very team representative. And so hopefully there isn't too much misalignment when you roll it out. And I have seen that, I've seen that work out.\n\n(01:03:43):\nThe second is there's just better results. You get to better problem articulation, you get a better strategic pillar, because there's just more minds on it than if it was just a product lead.\n\n(01:03:55):\nAnd the third thing is you have clearly defensible criteria and outputs, and if you want to change it, like I said, you have to go back to the criteria and the scoring and then say, \"Okay, why do we believe this has to be changed?\" And even a change is easy to justify once you do that. So it creates a lot of benefits, but ultimately, and we'll get to this a little bit more, it has to be tested with execution, and that's the most important thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:22):\nI think it's important to highlight, no framework playbook [inaudible 01:04:26] method is going to guarantee you have the correct strategy that will win and your company will thrive. It's always just the best effort at plan.\n\n(01:04:35):\nAs the quote, \"no good plan survives first contact with the customer.\"\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:04:41):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:42):\nCool. Let's talk through some examples.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:04:45):\nso the first example I wanted to talk about is at Zynga. I was at Zynga a very long time ago, and this was the heyday of social gaming on Facebook. The thing that I was extremely impressed about Zynga was the strategic clarity and strategic encoding at the company. And this was not attributable to me, by the way, this was already there when I got there as a entry-level PM, but the kind of strategic clarity there was really, really impressive and it was very evident and observable from all the games.\n\n(01:05:22):\nSo if you look at all the games, there were three elements that were very common across all the games. The first was viral game loops. There's these game loops that just required you to have a social and active social network to be successful and play, and it was very tightly and fictionally integrated into the core of the gameplay. That was the first one.\n\n(01:05:47):\nThe second one was there was this idea of paying to complete things. So you're not paying to skip a whole experience, what you're paying is just to complete it. So what happens then is different people, depending on how much time they have, complete different percentages of a progression task, or a part of the gameplay, and you only had to pay the rest to get through the experience. And it was this interesting experience where people put a lot of investment into it, and they didn't mind paying for the last 20% or 30%, which was very interesting, because it created this market for different elasticity of spend, different times that people had in their lives. And it was very, very clever. So that was again, very common across all the games.\n\n(01:06:38):\nAnd then the third was network. So all of Zynga games had this cross-promotional component at the top of the game and they would promote other games, and it's like the Zynga network was the most important thing, and not an individual game. And those were the three in our parlance now strategic pillars, and there were non-focus areas. It wasn't like...\n\n(01:07:05):\nThe focus wasn't on high-fidelity graphics, it wasn't on complex game mechanics, and this was extremely clear and hard-coded into the company culture and operations. And it was perfectly tuned to the environment at the time. Facebook platform afforded strong support with social graph, and channels, and basically the game studios contributed through different games in a very network accretive way.\n\n(01:07:31):\nSo for example, I was at Zynga San Diego, and we took the company into net new game genres like action strategy, match three puzzle games, but we stayed true to the strategic pillars of the company, and we had to invent new mechanics so that the strategic pillars would work in the new genres that we introduced to the company. And what was fascinating is the company actually had systems to reinforce these strategic pillars.\n\n(01:07:57):\nAnd, for example, the data infrastructure was very incredible at the time, and really reinforced these strategic pillars. There was this function called Central Product Management, which basically propagated best practices, made sure that games were network accretive and all these things worked in harmony to enhance those strategic pillars and reinforce it, and it worked really well. The company, if I remember right, got to a billion dollars, it was the fastest to get to a billion dollars in the",

And temporarily... Basically, if you go back to that resonance concept, that deep resonance between the product and the market was temporarily lost once that shift happened to mobile.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:51):\nSo there's a lot here. I think one interesting note here is, as you said, the strategy work you're doing, which sounds like a lot of time, eight to 12 weeks potentially, this lasted a long time for Zynga. And so I think it's important to remember the work you're doing here, even though...\n\n(01:09:06):\nOn the one hand it feels like a long time, on the other hand, it feels like very little time to come up with the things that will most help your business grow. In this case, these three elements for Zynga. And by the way, these three pillars, they didn't emerge from this method, but it helped you see the power of being very clear...\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:09:24):\nClear, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:25):\nAnd having everything centered around, we all agree, these are the three ways we win. Okay, cool. And then I think the number three, again, I just want to highlight the power of just very few bets in investments. So it's always three. I've always suggested three as well. Some people are like, \"three to five,\" but I think it's... You just find, in general, three is the right number as much? Try very, very hard to make it three?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:09:46):\nI agree.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:47):\nOkay, cool.\n\n(01:09:48):\nAnd then I think there's also this element of differentiation being really important. So these three elements you shared for Zynga are just like they're unique and differentiated for Zynga. Network, powers of apps driving other apps, paying to complete, these are things Zynga has figured out, \"this is how we\" win versus other products in the market.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:10:08):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:09):\nSweet. Anything else along those lines with Zynga?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:10:13):\nThat was in hindsight reflection, Lenny, I was pretty naive when I was there, and I realized how... And this was, in fact, what led to my blind spot when I joined Headspace from Zynga, that you even need a strategy. That's the story I said at the beginning.\n\n(01:10:33):\nThe reason is because Zynga had it figured out so well that I didn't actually have a need to exercise that muscle at Zynga, and we just had to come up with new games that applied that strategy. And so it was a net new muscle I had to develop when I got to Headspace.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:48):\nIt's like that parable of the fish swimming in the water where the older fish swims by and he's like, \"How's the water?\" And they're like, \"Hmm?\" And then he leaves and he's like, \"What's water?\" You just don't realize what you're in. You don't realize what you're surrounded by until it's gone.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:11:06):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:07):\nMaybe one other thing I just want to highlight while we're on this topic is just the power of focus. In the case of Zynga, just this focus on everything we do needs to get these things, these three things, everything we do, we need to do in order to win. And I think that's a recurring theme in what you're talking about, is just focus. The steps of the process are focus on this one part for now. So I think that's a really interesting thread is just the power of focus.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:11:32):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:33):\nOkay, cool.\n\n(01:11:35):\nAnd now you have another example of your time at Meta.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:11:37):\nAt Meta there's this fascinating example, which I think illustrates a different point, which is...\n\n(01:11:46):\nBasically I was standing up the product strategy for a couple of product growth teams in Reality Labs, Oculus, which was coming up with the Quest II at the time. This is a standalone headset, and then Portal, which was our video conferencing product. And we stood up these teams to go after product growth, which is basically driving hardware sales through software features. And we went through this process that I just described. We stood up strategic pillars, and the strategic pillars were fairly similar for both Portal, which is our video conferencing product, and Oculus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:24):\nI love Portal by the way.

We stood up strategic pillars, and the strategic pillars were fairly similar for both Portal, which is our video conferencing product, and Oculus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:24):\nI love Portal by the way. I was a big fan of... Sad that it's no longer around.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:12:31):\nAnd that led to features that are known to everybody, like the Oculus Referrals Program, the Portal Memories Integration, where you see one of your Facebook memories on the Portal, sponsored ad in your Facebook feed. And also we had this section on the Facebook app, which is also from Facebook at the time, and then eventually also from Meta, which is these other products from the Facebook ecosystem. And all those came out of that effort.\n\n(01:13:01):\nAnd about 18 months into it, they actually had very different outcomes. So on one hand the Oculus effort was incredibly successful, and we graduated it into the VR division at Meta, and till today it continues to be an incredibly successful effort. The Portal effort actually didn't move the needle as much as we wanted to, and we sunset it, and we basically redeployed that team to other initiatives. And that's super interesting. Basically it was like the same strategy process. We got the nearly identical strategic pillars, but eventually completely different outcomes.\n\n(01:13:49):\nAnd I think that that illustrates the most important point about strategy, which is intrinsically strategy has no business value. It's basically a document with a few words. And I think it starts accumulating value as you generate business impact and results. And that happens when you actually test strategy with execution.\n\n(01:14:15):\nAnd so ultimately any strategy is only as good as the results it produces. And so one has to have the intellectual honesty, and the humility, and the courage to say when it's working and when it's not. And sometimes what happens is parts of your strategy might work, parts might not, and you have to pivot away from some and double down on some. But I do think there's that evaluation that's really critical and testing strategy with execution.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:44):\nSuch a great point. Just a strategy sitting there in a doc is worthless, where the worth comes from, is it actually having impact and being successful. Makes me think about a product manager also, just a PM is not worth anything until they help you drive impact.\n\n(01:15:02):\nI think an important, to trickle down from that point, is that you don't want to spend too long just thinking about strategy, you want to spend as little time as possible to get to a strong hypothesis, basically to start learning if this is the right path. And so I love that your approach is like this middle ground between give it real time, but don't spend three, four or five months working on this one document that just maybe one day you'll use.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:15:31):\nExactly.\n\n(01:15:31):\nAnd there is room for a six-month process, which we'll get to in a moment. But for small S I wouldn't recommend more than two or three months.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:39):\nAnd again, small S strategy is for a couple of years out, not like Exactly. It's like a timeframe. Okay, cool.\n\n(01:15:47):\nOkay. Anything else along those lines of the examples of Meta or Zynga?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:15:53):\nThose are pretty good lessons I would say.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:55):\nOkay, sweet.\n\n(01:15:56):\nSo, let's talk about big-S strategy. When should you approach strategy this way and what are just the steps of it?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:16:06):\nSo everything we've spoken about so far is what I would call small S, and it's very problem focused. It's basically what I call present forward.\n\n(01:16:17):\nIt's like you have something, you have a product out there, it has a bunch of problems. How do we make it better for... What are the areas we tackle for maximum impact? Typically led by product managers. And there's this interesting quote by Elon Musk, which is, \"Life has to be about more than just solving problems.\" And he says it in the context of the aspiration to become a multi-planetary species, but I think this is true of every company, big or small. And there needs to be an aspirational and cool component to strategy. And I call this big-S strategy.\n\n(01:16:56):\nI'll run through this at a higher level because I think this is a little bit more fluid in how you build the big-S strategy. And it typically takes longer, potentially up to about six months. The approach is a bit different from small S. And you start with the company mission and vision, and there is a little bit of groundwork that is done on long-term cultural trends, social trends, competitive trends, technological trends, and those are all the backdrop to trigger ideas. And what you do with that backdrop is you, again, do these leadership interviews, but with a different goal of generating long-term futures.\n\n(01:17:41):\nAnd some of the questions you can ask during these interviews are \"What does a day in the life of a user look like in five years? What does the product look like in five to 10 years? Why is the world better in",

What does the product look like in five to 10 years? Why is the world better in 10 years? And what is the most exciting version of that view?\" And basically take all of that input and cluster it into I would say, three cohesive holes.\n\n(01:18:05):\nAnd what I mean by that is three, at least fairly distinct, descriptions of the future. So to give you almost a very simple example, imagine you doing big S for the future of travel. You could have a future that is talking all about fully autonomous travel, where there's very little human involvement in going from A to B. You could talk about another future where there's extreme speed, where you can get from A to B really fast across the world that is really fast. You could talk about a third where there is no travel, it's virtual travel, and you still have the feeling of travel, and you accomplish the same goals.\n\n(01:18:45):\nBut those are different futures, they have different properties, like different elements to them. And once you generate those distinct futures, you actually generate prototypes with learning goals. And think of these prototypes as concept cars. And the automobile industry uses this notion of concept cars. Concept cars, the interesting thing about concept cars is they're never commercialized. They're often produced for inspiration, and to potentially take some part of them, like maybe a technology or a feature, and that is brought into mainstream production.\n\n(01:19:23):\nSo think of these prototypes as these concept cars that really drive inspiration and potentially give you some small nuggets that you can run with. And then you start doing research with them with potential users, you answer key questions, and you uncover certain elements that resonate with people. So you eliminate a whole bunch of stuff, you combine a whole bunch of stuff, and you establish some winning components that are interesting.\n\n(01:19:48):\nAnd then what you do is you push stuff that is winning into the product, live product, testing. So this is actually something that you actually want to start testing your way into and understanding if it works from a scalable standpoint. And this whole thing is typically led not by the PM team, but by design and UXR. And intentionally it's a little bit more open-ended and green field. And it actually is a very different mind space that people have when they approach big. So the roadmap is really built through a combination of small-S and big-S work. And, for example, at VRChat, we are doing both small-S and big-S work, Lenny. And they are run as parallel work streams. The product management team is leading the charge of the small-S work, and the design team is leading the charge on the big-S work. And it's really exciting stuff. What's coming out of both work streams is really exciting and really different. And so we are building the bridge from both sides and both work streams ultimately flow into one roadmap. It's almost like two tributaries that ultimately merge into one river. That's how I would think about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:02):\nThere's so many things here that are so...\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:21:01):\nThat's how I would think about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:02):\nThere's so many things here that are so interesting. One is we've had this conversation on the podcast a couple of times, this point that people think and see the world differently. Some people are very open-minded and creative, and think big, blue sky people. Some people, me, just like, \"What are we doing next? How do we move this metric? Let's talk about concrete things that we can do?\" For this big S approach, I think what I'm hearing is make sure the people leading it are very open-minded, creative, blue sky type people. If you're the person that's like, \"How will this move our metric?\" Maybe you shouldn't be leading it and give someone else the reins.\n\n(01:21:40):\nCool. And then with these timelines of doing both at once, it's probably hard to align them fully. So what I'm hearing is it's like these are kind of ongoing sometimes.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:21:49):\nCorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:50):\nAnd they'll both inform what you're doing. You don't need to have this perfect timeline of-\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:21:54):\nI agree to this. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:56):\nSweet. And the big thinking I love, because sometimes, you may experience this, designers often are like, \"Oh, we just work on all this boring, incremental optimization stuff. I want to think bigger.\" Which is great, and this is a really good lever to allow for that in a contained environment. Cool. Let's just go crazy. Let's think about what this could be in the future. Still, let's make sure we're moving some metrics short-term, but let's give us opportunity to think big. And oftentimes the biggest ideas come out of that. So I love it's giving space for both types of thinking, thinking bigger and thinking long term.\n\n(01:22:30):\nAnything else about these two methods that might be interesting to share? Otherwise, I want to talk about AI a little bit, just how that impacts things and a couple other things.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01",

Otherwise, I want to talk about AI a little bit, just how that impacts things and a couple other things.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:22:39):\nYeah, yeah. I'll end on one short sort of note on how this all feels when you do it, and then we can segue into AI-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:47):\nGreat, great.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:22:48):\n... Lenny. So I think that whether it's big S or small S, these are incredibly satisfying processes to go through in the end. So once you get to the end, they're incredibly deeply satisfying. But with anything in life that is very deeply satisfying at the end, they have a ton of challenge, frustration, and dead ends while you go through it where you kind of get a lot of self-doubt like, \"Hey, will you ever reach the end?\" And I just want to sort of normalize that. That's actually normal and I want people to expect that as they go through it. And I think that's what makes it even more rewarding when you get to that sort of point where you start to see things connecting.\n\n(01:23:33):\nThe second thing is I would say that the person who's leading the charge on these efforts has to be really good at connecting diverse viewpoints and keeping them all moving forward. And it's not easy, it's very hard because sometimes you have people who take you in different directions and you have to keep it all hanging together.\n\n(01:23:57):\nSo in terms of picking people who have that skill, who are good integrators, who are good connect the dots, I think it's critical for these to be successful. And in some ways low ego because it's not like... They do get to introduce their own ideas, but truly, it's about bringing the team together. So that's the skill that you should look for for these leads.\n\n(01:24:22):\nAnd then the third piece is I would say that I would just approach these with a little bit of a lighter touch and more playful sort of approach, because it's an intensive process, it's a long process. And people can get tired, they can find it grindy. So just having a little bit of playfulness along the way goes a long way in making it feel more tolerable for the people going through it. So those are some thoughts about either of these processes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:48):\nThat was really important context, especially this will be frustrating throughout. It sounds really beautiful and great and smooth as you describe it. In reality, there's a lot of pain that goes into... Because you're making hard decisions. A lot of people have opinions, they have perspectives, there's data that's... Rarely is there clear answer from the beginning, so I think that's really important context.\n\n(01:25:08):\nI wanted to actually come back to your point you made about how Elon made this point about life shouldn't just be about solving problems. I think part of that quote is just like we should work on things that are awesome and exciting and inspiring, that aren't just immediately pain solvers. And he's very good at that, just inspiring people to what could be, and we should be thinking much bigger than we are.\n\n(01:25:32):\nI was actually at an interview with Zuck where he said the same thing. He's probably inspired by Elon. He's like, \"I've just gotten to a point in my career where I want to work on awesome stuff, stuff that is just awe inspiring, not just-\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:25:43):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:44):\n... another social feature.\" so I think that's a really important point. And there's a lot of power in that. People get really excited about holy moly, I did not imagine this is what Headspace could become, what VRChat could become, what Meta could become. It's just really powerful, getting people really inspired. And I love this process they shared of how to do that.\n\n(01:26:03):\nAnd I didn't actually summarize it, so I have it right here in front of me. I'll just share the five steps of the biggest process. So it's preparation, mission, you figure [inaudible 01:26:10] mission, vision, trends, interview people about where they think things are going. Then you come up with three distinct futures of what the future might look like if you were to do the things you're thinking. Then you build prototypes of what might this look like? And then you actually test these in your product, which I love, to start de-risking these ideas. That helps you converge to here's actual plan we want to execute, and then you turn that into roadmap.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:26:36):\nYeah, yeah. And the first testing of the prototypes is with UXR, so it's more sort of concept testing or prototype testing with a handful of users. And then you use that as synthesizing to a live product test.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:50):\nGreat.

Let's try.\" Sweet. Okay, so just two more things. One is I want to talk about AI briefly, of how that impacts this work. And then two, just maybe a recap of the framework for people that are listening, you're like, \"Oh my god, I have so much. I wrote all these notes.\" Let's give them a summary so they could remember to use it.\n\n(01:27:14):\nOkay, cool. So let's talk about AI briefly. How has AI tooling helped you evolve this process? How can people use AI to make this easier?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:27:24):\nSo the first disclaimer is I'm not sort of an AI futurist, but I read all the emerging stuff that's coming out, most of the emerging stuff that's coming out and use some of the tools. And it's fascinating what's happening. And I think it will definitely have an impact on strategy formulation. So what I'll share is what resonates for me in the context of strategy formulation with AI.\n\n(01:27:52):\nSo right away, I think the basic idea is everybody should be using assistance in the strategy formulation process with the basic tools that we have. And there are two ways to get AI to assist you in the strategy formulation process. The first is to support the preparation phase in terms of research. And this could be competitive analysis and, for example, you could do trend analysis from a vast library of competitors' release notes. And you can sort of say, \"Okay, what are the themes of investment of a competitor's release notes?\" Or you could do a reviews analysis of a competitor product and sort of understand what's resonating for users, what's not. And you could also ask a tool like ChatGPT to do a head-to-head comparison between a few players on a certain dimension and really give you a heat map of how they all stack up. And you could also ask an open-ended question like, \"Hey, why is this new product so successful? Why is it getting so many users?\" And there's some good hypothesis that you usually get. So really leverage in sort of the preparation phase from a competitive analysis standpoint.\n\n(01:29:12):\nThe second one is in this idea called generating mock strategies. And I know Claire Rowe at your summit spoke about this, and I think this is absolutely right and should be a critical input into the strategy process, which is asking these tools for a mock strategy. And I call this a mock strategy because it's kind of almost the answer but not quite the answer. So what I've found is that these mock strategies, like let's say I support VRChat now and I ask it like, \"Hey, what should VRChat do? How should we grow?\" And it generates a mock strategy.\n\n(01:29:49):\nWhat I've found is that it's, one, surprisingly good. It's incredibly well-informed and well-articulated. I've also found that its biggest strength is also somewhat its weakness, which is these mock strategies tend to be pretty comprehensive and extensive, and there's an investment recommendation in a vast number of areas. So basically, if you remember, the core of strategy is really to be very targeted and to be very focused. So these mock strategies become an interesting input and the burden is still on the team to down-select into the most important areas for investment. So forcing that choice still, I think, is a human element and needs that layer of additional judgment, which is very context specific to the company. So this is sort of right away, I think people should be doing this.\n\n(01:30:44):\nI think more medium term and probably not too distant future and likely sooner than we all think, there's probably going to be, sort of the model that resonates with me is sort of the multi-agent model, which is you probably have different components of the strategy workflow automated. So you probably have a strategy agent, you probably have a roadmap or feature agent, you have maybe a engineering agent, and these can communicate amongst each other to cycle through results and iterate. And I think Armand Ruiz from IBM has some good definitional frameworks on some of the stuff. He shares it often on LinkedIn.\n\n(01:31:27):\nBut let's take a simple example. I can easily imagine something like this for a topic like onboarding. So every company and product team obsesses about their onboarding experience. And today, there are advanced experimentation frameworks. So imagine you're expecting a large surge in traffic. There's these sort of experimental frameworks like multi-armed bandits that can really help you get to the optimal sort of variation very quickly in real time. And there are variations of that, like contextual multi-armed bandits, there's combinatorial bandits.\n\n(01:32:04):\nBut the interesting thing is they still rely on human design of the variations, the different variations that you test. Even though the experimentation framework is very sophisticated, the variations are still human generated. Now imagine if those variations could actually be generated through generative AI and could be plugged into the advanced experimentation frameworks. The possibilities become infinite. And really, you might be surprised by what you find is the winning onboarding experience that you couldn't even have humanly imagined. And it might be different for every user, different for every sort of territory, etc.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:44):\nThat is such a cool idea, I just want to say.",

And it might be different for every user, different for every sort of territory, etc.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:44):\nThat is such a cool idea, I just want to say. This agent that's just running, thinking about ways to optimize your onboarding, coming up with concepts that you probably review, like, \"Cool, let's try it.\" And then it does it, ships an experiment to run it and just is constantly optimizing your onboarding. Holy shit, that's an awesome idea. I think everyone will have this.\n\n(01:33:06):\nAnd then what that makes me think there's going to be some company that's built the best onboarding agent. That's what you're going to be paying for.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:33:14):\nTotally. Totally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:14):\nOh my god, that's so good. Okay. Great. Great idea.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:33:16):\nYeah, yeah. So then the question becomes, hey, what is our job? Our job becomes architecting bigger and bigger pieces of the product to take advantage of these agents. And there will be a sequential increase in the complexity of workloads that get automated over time. Onboarding is probably relatively on the easier side in terms of complexity of workload. And you get into deeper experiences, eventually AI will get there.\n\n(01:33:44):\nSo funnily enough, when that happens, some of the manual processes I describe about will seem archaic. But I think the fundamentals will still have a long shelf life, and as you think about these automated frameworks as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:59):\nMan, this could be its own podcast. I have this whole post about how AI, how PMs are the best position, role in tech to thrive in a world of AI, which I'll link to that makes people, I find, feel better when they hear you talk about how much might get done through agents in AI.\n\n(01:34:14):\nThe other quick thought I had, and I want to get to the wrap up, is I have this ongoing debate with a friend about strategy in AI. My feeling is in theory, an AI tool will be incredibly good at coming up with your strategy for you because it's just, here's all the data, here's everything you need to know, how do we win? And to me, that feels like the ultimate way AI is good, is just here's data, here's what I found as a path to a winning. But my friend's also arguing that's the one thing that AI will be least good at because that's where we need people and context and discussion, all these things.\n\n(01:34:53):\nI don't know, it's like one or the other. Either AI will be incredibly good at helping you figure out your strategy or the worst.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:34:58):\nInteresting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:00):\nI'm curious. I'm curious, I guess, do you have any quick thoughts on that? Where do you side?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:35:05):\nI think there is a crossover point where the human judgment will be inferior to something that's able to process multiple signals simultaneously. There's an element of lateral thinking as well here, and I'll sort of share a simple example.\n\n(01:35:24):\nFor those who drive Tesla cars with the fully self-driving capabilities, when you make a turn, humans have this fairly narrow field of vision. So you have to look both ways and you have to make a decision combining both those signals, right? Whereas the car has six cameras, which is simultaneously processing and it can make a decision not in sequence, but in parallel. And it moves with confidence at turnings because of that. So there is this crossover point where some of these, the ability to hold multiple signals in the head, it's going to be more... It's going to be stronger.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:09):\nThat makes total sense. What it makes me think about, there's going to be a strategy agent just sitting around always looking for ways to improve your strategy and point you all in a different direction. Oh my god, future is wild, as I've said before.\n\n(01:36:21):\nOkay, let's do a quick wrap up of the process for folks that are taking notes and they're like, \"Cool, here's the overview.\" So let's just do that and then let's go to get to the exciting lightning round.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:36:31):\nI think the quick recap of everything we've covered is that product strategy definitionally sits between mission vision at the top and plan at the bottom. So it sits between those two either at the company level or at the team level. What it does is it forces choice to deploy scarce resources towards maximum impact. And think about the frequency selection and resonance as an analogy, and it ideally includes three components. A handful of areas to focus on, which we call strategic pillars, and several areas that are explicitly not the focus and why. That's really it in terms of what product strategy is.\n\n(01:37:12):\nThere is a smallest flavor of it which focuses on solving problems. It's what I call present forward, and it typically operates in a two-year horizon. We use a five-stage process to get there, and it takes about eight to 12 weeks. There is a biggest process that focuses on an aspirational future, is future",

There is a biggest process that focuses on an aspirational future, is future backward and typically has a three, five, 10-year horizon, also a five-stage process, and can be ongoing up to a six-month period to give it enough space to generate something exciting.\n\n(01:37:47):\nAnd the roadmap for the company or the team is built from a combination of smallest and biggest work, which is like building a bridge from both sides of a river. And ultimately, any strategy is only as good as the results it can produce. So test and iterate through execution and double down on what's working and pivot away from what's not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:10):\nIncredible. I'm glad we did that. Anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:38:18):\nJust all the best with strategy work and ultimately individual and business success.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:26):\nAmazing. And when I asked you at the beginning, before we started recording, what your goal was for this conversation, your answer was just to create a ripple of success across companies and teams, and I feel like we've done that.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:38:36):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:37):\nOkay. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning ground. Chandra, are you ready?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:38:41):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:43):\nLet's do it. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:38:47):\nYeah, I love books on creativity and innovation, Lenny, and some of my classic favorites are Walt Disney's biography. And there's several out there, but I think the one that I like the most is the Triumph of the American Imagination. And what's interesting is it talks about how Walt Disney actually loved the theme parks more than the movies. And the reason for that was he could actually tinker with the theme parks. He could make changes to where the rides were, he could change rides in and out, and then he could observe real sort of changes to reactions of people flowing into the theme parks, which he couldn't do with the movies because once it was produced, it was done, it was out of his control. And it was interesting, he was basically A-B testing long before the term was coined. And it's just a fascinating look into how his brain worked, way ahead of its time.\n\n(01:39:46):\nThe other classic is Ed Catmull's Creativity Inc, and it talks about all the negative forces that eat away at creativity in an organization. How do you, as the leader, have to keep them at bay and make sure the team can innovate?\n\n(01:40:01):\nAnd then there's this probably less popular book, but really good one from Tom Kelly of IDEO, which is The Ten Faces of Innovation. It talks about different archetypes that you need on the team that are essential for creating something special. And you actually need, I think there's the devil's advocate, you need the researcher, you need the ethnographer, you need the stage setter. There's all these interesting personalities that you need to actually make something successful. So I would say those are some of the ones that I usually recommend, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:37):\nThat's a really cool... That third book is really interesting, I haven't heard of that. And Creativity Inc, something I want to highlight real quick is to your point, that a lot of it is how to avoid killing good ideas. And my favorite metaphor from that book is the ugly baby metaphor where every new idea is an ugly baby that people just want to get rid of. Get rid of this ugly baby, we don't want this around here. And just every new idea is ugly when it starts, and you need to protect the ugly baby, basically. Although I don't know who's hurting ugly babies, that's not-\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:41:06):\nYeah, yeah, it feels a bit... Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:08):\nFeels aggressive.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:41:08):\nHarsh.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:11):\nYeah, harsh. Yeah. But it's memorable because I've never forgotten that.\n\n(01:41:14):\nOkay, next question. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:41:19):\nYeah, yeah. We watch a lot of animated films with the kids. But were a couple of good movies this year. We really liked If, Imaginary Friend, it's about growing up and forgetting these memories of your younger days, is was a really nice movie. And then of course, we enjoyed Dune II as well. It was a fun watch. But most of our time is dominated by the kids sort of animated folks at home or the cinema.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:53):\nThere's a new Dune TV show, I don't know if you've been watching it. It just started recently on HBO. It's not the best thing",

I think there's a third movie coming out.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:42:04):\nI see.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:06):\nThird question, do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:42:10):\nYeah, yeah. I've been playing this cute little game for the last few days. It's called Capybara Go! It's a tab-based strategy RPG game. It's got really humorous writing and this cute capybara that goes off on an adventure. It's very well-paced and it's a very well-produced game. It's one game I've been playing recently.\n\n(01:42:37):\nI've also been poking around Bluesky. Bluesky is interesting. I haven't gotten into a habit yet, but it's super interesting concept of empowering the community with these community-generated feeds. It's very different experience. But it's also interesting, there's a trade-off with the simplicity of the product and what you get with the additional complexity. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out, how it scales.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:05):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work or in life?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:43:10):\nSo there was this 1995 interview of Steve Jobs where he talks about this idea of there's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product, and it sort of stuck with me over the years. And the simple way to think about that is it takes a lot of effort to make something special. And conversely, if it's easy, it's probably not that special or not that great. And it's something that I sort of think about when we build product, is there sufficient pain here where it's sort of a proxy for, are we creating something great, is interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:53):\nWow. It makes me think about founder mode a little bit. Like people talk about founder mode. The reason founder mode I think is important is the people that are most committed and passionate and driven to go through that pain and continue to make it... To take it from just an ugly baby idea to an awesome winning product oftentimes needs to be the founder. And that's why I think it's kind of emerged as a trend is it's important to have that drive, to just-\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:43:54):\nSurely. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:22):\n... continue to refine it and not just like, \"I had the idea, go build it now.\"\n\n(01:44:27):\nOkay, final question. You have an amazing background behind you. [inaudible 01:44:31] if people are on YouTube, it's just a beautiful book background, a bunch of objects and books. I'm curious if there's an object on there or a book on there that might be fun to highlight that you're especially into or proud of. And feel free to turn around if you want to look around. Curious if there's one thing that stands out, like, \"Oh, here's this thing, [inaudible 01:44:48].\"\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:44:48):\nOh, well, it's the picture of my kids right in the center, which is without doubt the most important and memorable thing there. It's also caught it a unique time when they were incredibly... They were sort of super embracing each other and it's a phase where they've grown out of it. Now there's a lot more, I think rivalry and then sibling tussles. But that moment is my favorite.\n\n(01:45:18):\nI also have a bunch of fun stuff, like a big sort of Snoopy fan, and so it is... Also a big Beetles fan, so that picture is actually an interesting blend between Snoopy walking, crossing the road and then the Beetles crossing the other way. And then a bunch of books that are more memorable over the years. You'll see Creativity Inc there, you'll see The Ten Phases of Innovation, all of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:45:45):\nAmazing. Thank you for sharing... Your kids' photo's blocked when you're in the center, so it's like a little Easter egg. Thank you for sharing that. Chandra, this was incredible. It was everything I was hoping it'd be. I think we're going to create that ripple that you were hoping for.\n\n(01:45:57):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:46:02):\nA reasonable choice would be LinkedIn to reach me, and I really, like you and I discussed earlier, I'd be really happy if this creates that kind of ripple effect of successes, both for individuals and for products. And I want everybody to think of this, the stuff I shared as a bit of an open source model. So test some of the concepts, modify it,",

You've been the CEO of Ancestry now for the past three and a half years. This is a career path that a lot of people dream of.\n\nDeb Liu (00:00:11):\nSome of the best PMs I have ever worked with are terrible PMs for their career. They just drift from job to job. \"Hey, should I take this role or this role? How do I think about this?\" But if I said you had to write a spec for your career, what does success look like? How are you going to get there?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):\nYou wrote this awesome post about introverts and how hard it is to be successful as an introvert.\n\nDeb Liu (00:00:28):\nThe workplace is really favoring people who can speak up. It looks like self-promotion. I wouldn't want to do that because it's self-promotion. But instead, what if I called it educating about all the great work your team has been doing? Helping people see why your team should get more resources, you have to actually share what you do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):\nIs there something that you believe that you think most other people don't believe?\n\nDeb Liu (00:00:49):\nThe most important career decision you make is who you marry. Is this person lifting you up or pushing you back? You will have a much more successful career if your home life is in balance. It's like a yin and a yang.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):\nToday, my guest is Deb Liu. Deb was VP of product at Facebook where she spent over 11 years and while they're created and led Facebook marketplace, which is now used by over 1 billion people monthly, she also led the development of Facebook's first mobile ad product for apps and its mobile ad network. Also built the company's games business and payments platform, including Facebook Pay.\n\n(00:01:23):\nPrior to Facebook, she was director at both PayPal and eBay. She's on the board of Intuit and for the past three and a half years, she's been the CEO of Ancestry. I actually generally have a rule of no CEOs on this podcast, but to me, Deb is a great exception because she's a product person at heart. In our conversation, Deb shares a ton of tactical career advice, including why resilience is so key to career success, how to PM your career like you PM your product, how to be successful in business as an introvert, what she's learned about building multiple billion dollars zero to one businesses within a large company like Facebook and so much more.\n\n(00:01:59):\nDeb is so full of wisdom and I'm really excited to share her insights with more people. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Deb Liu.\n\n(00:02:18):\nDeb, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nDeb Liu (00:02:21):\nIt's wonderful to be here, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:23):\nIt's wonderful to have you here. You have had such an incredible career. You're VP of product at Facebook. You're director at eBay and PayPal. You're on the board of Intuit. You've been the CEO of Ancestry now for the past three and a half years. This is a career path that a lot of people dream of and honestly just like one of those roles is a dream for a lot of people. And so I wanted to start with just this question and I want to see where the conversation takes us. If you could give one specific piece of advice to someone that's looking to do well in their career or to do better in their career based on what has worked well for you, what would that be?\n\nDeb Liu (00:03:02):\nAlways be learning, and I tell this to everybody, so I often tell people, someone who's always learning is always going to exceed someone who's the expert today. You're going to find people... The one thing about school is that we go to school and there's such a thing as getting a hundred on the test, a perfect score on the SAT, graduating with a 4.0. Well, there's nothing like that in careers, right? We think it's actually a non-linear experience and there's always something better than you at speaking or presenting or strategy or execution. But if you're always learning, learning from the best, getting feedback, you're always going to get better every single day.\n\n(00:03:35):\nAnd that's what I have always held, which is each job I took, I didn't necessarily qualify for it. I wasn't necessarily the very best at it, and so it became the student of being better at that job. And once I mastered that, I was a student for something else, something else and something else. And so I always balanced learning and impact, which was you can have the most impact, the job you know the best, but then you stop learning. And if you're learning all the time, you're not necessarily having impact.\n\n(00:04:00):\nSo how do you keep going back and forth and back and forth so that you're not going straight up a lot or you're actually laddering back and forth into different things where you're having an amazing time where you know everything and then you're the newbie again and learning new things, and you're incorporating what you used to know into what you're learning and the impact that you have today and so",

That's workos.com.\n\n(00:07:03):\nYou talked about you got into a new job maybe you weren't ready for and you had to learn on the job. So either maybe share story one of those experiences or just like how do you actually do this? So someone's listening, they're like, how do I learn? What am I learning?\n\nDeb Liu (00:07:14):\nWe'll start with my career in tech. So I had worked in consulting before business school. I went to Stanford for business school, came out to California, didn't know that much about tech, but I really loved using eBay. So I interned there my first year in business school and then when it came to finding a job, I really wasn't sure what we wanted to do, but we wanted to move back to the East Coast. And so I wasn't looking and I couldn't find a job. I think it was really hard. It was 2002. And so I ran into Tim Wenzel and Catherine Wu. So Catherine Wu was from Airbnb as you might know her. And Tim Wenzel put together the PayPal Mafia. He was the recruiter for PayPal.\n\n(00:07:51):\nWent to this table and I said, \"Absolutely love PayPal, use it all the time. I'm a big seller on eBay,\" and he's like, \"Do you want a job?\" I'm like, \"No, I'm actually going back east. \"And he's like, \"Just come in and talk to us.\" And so I said, \"Okay. Well, what kind of jobs do you have?\" And he's like, \"I have jobs in product and I have jobs in marketing.\" Now, I've taken marketing class obviously in business school, and I said, \"I wonder what this other product job is.\"\n\n(00:08:12):\nSo I look over at Catherine and I've seen her around Stanford before, so she was a year ahead of me and I said, \"Well, what do you do?\" She said, \"Product.\" I'm like, \"That sounds good. I'll do that.\" And that's actually how I fell into product management. Well, I actually, and I'm embarrassed to say faked my way through those interviews, because during the interviews they're like, \"Well, what would you build?\" And since I was an avid user of both products, I could really richly say, \"Here's the product feedback I have. Here are the new products you should build. Here's my feedback on things that we should be doing differently.\"\n\n(",

Here are the new products you should build. Here's my feedback on things that we should be doing differently.\"\n\n(00:08:39):\nAnd they said, \"Congratulations.\" And they gave me the job. And embarrassingly I went to the first day of work and I said to Amy Clement, who was the VP of product at the time, and I said, \"Okay, I literally have no idea what this product job is.\"\n\n(00:08:54):\nShe showed me the ropes and she was so incredible. She actually showed me, she said, \"All those ideas you had, all that energy you've had around building these things, we go do that. Let's go do it.\" And I said, \"Well, how do you do that?\" And she said, \"Well, you write down what you want to build and you work with the engineers to do it.\" And I just remember thinking, \"This is crazy. I have no idea what I'm doing.\"\n\n(00:09:14):\nIt was such an incredible adventure though. Those first few years, I just learned so much about the craft of building, how to really think through product use cases, how to think through what customers wanted, not just the customer of one, myself, but really what true customers and customer cohorts wanted. And so it was really a time when I felt like I was really blossoming, but I didn't come in with mastery. I came with a curiosity and I think that's what made me a great product manager was that I didn't have a set way of doing things. There wasn't some playbook I was trying to play. There wasn't some framework, but instead I was willing to learn.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:46):\nSo one takeaway might be from this, the phrase, fake it till you make it. Any thoughts on just how to... I imagine many people right now are like, \"Oh, I'm trying to get a job as a pm. How do I do this? That sounds great. I'm going to pass this interview, figure out the job after I joined.\"\n\nDeb Liu (00:10:02):\nComing in with humbleness was really important, but during the interview process, actually, I didn't realize this, but they asked me questions as if I was a product manager, as if I knew what I was doing. I think when you have passion around a product or passion around a company or around a business model or around something, it shows. And so it's not necessarily faking the enthusiasm or faking the idea that you want to work there, but you don't have to know how to write this spec or PRD or briefings or anything like that. You don't know how to do customer research or do data analytics or read reports, but instead show your passion around the product itself, around the use case, around the customer.\n\n(00:10:41):\nShow who you are and why you care. I think sometimes people just say, \"I want a product job.\" But you have to be able to fall in love with the problem. You have to fall in love, not with the product, but I said the problem, right? The use case. What problem are you trying to solve? And if you can do that, you can be a great product manager even without a lot of experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:00):\nThat's an awesome piece of advice. So just lean into the passion. First of all, part of it is you have to be excited about the thing you're trying to work on or thinking about the company you're thinking about joining. Sounds like that's a prerequisite here. We have a podcast episode with Uri Levine who has a whole book called Fall in Love with the Problem, which is all about that same idea actually for startup founders.\n\nDeb Liu (00:11:20):\nI'll have to read it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:20):\nYeah, he always wears a shirt, fall in love with the problem, not the solution.\n\nDeb Liu (00:11:23):\nYes, is absolutely the most important skill for a product leader.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:27):\nSomething else I've heard you talk about in terms of something that contributed to your success is being okay with failure and just bouncing back quickly versus avoiding failure. Is that something that you can come back to a lot?\n\nDeb Liu (00:11:40):\nWell, here's what I noticed about everybody. I've coached a ton of people in my life. I have managed big teens and the people who are most successful are not the people who had no failures, who were lived charm lives, head up into the right careers and got promoted every cycle. The people who were most successful were the ones who actually through adversity, learned to turn stumbling blocks into stepping stones. They were the ones who got hard feedback and then came back stronger because now they learned what to do differently.\n\n(00:12:09):\nThey were the ones who products failed, but they said, \"You know what? I'm going to turn this failure into success. I'm going to take those lessons and make this company stronger.\" When you live a charmed product life, you always work on everything that's easy. You don't actually... Trees are strong because they bend in the wind, because they're tested, because it's cold, because it's windy, because there's conditions.\n\n(00:12:31):\nAnd that's how a tree goes",

Trees are strong because they bend in the wind, because they're tested, because it's cold, because it's windy, because there's conditions.\n\n(00:12:31):\nAnd that's how a tree goes grow strong and tall over many generations. And I think sometimes we think, \"Oh yeah, I wish I lived a charm life.\" And that is not what we want. You want to have enough adversity that you learn to overcome so that you can build stronger over time and build resilience in your career.\n\n(00:12:50):\nI've seen that so much, which is the best product leaders I ever worked with are the ones that have the toughest stories, that had the hardest feedback, but also the ones who were able to bounce back quickly and make it happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:02):\nWe have a segment on this podcast called Failure Corner where people share a failure they went through kind of along the same lines and something we learned from that experience. Is there an example of that from your career where a failure made you stronger?\n\nDeb Liu (00:13:13):\nYeah. I remember there was a job that I really wanted at Facebook and I'd been there for a long time. I had been leading different teams. I was a VP of product and then GM. There was one job that I never got to do, so I got to do all the jobs I wanted and Mark gave it to someone else. I told him at the time when he gave it to the first person who was amazing at it, I said, \"If this job were open, I'd like to be considered for it.\"\n\n(00:13:37):\nThe job opened up later, gave it to someone else. And I said to Mark, again, \"I really wanted that job.\" And he said, \"Not only will I not give you that job, you'll never have that job at this company.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:49):\nWhat?\n\nDeb Liu (00:13:51):\nHe didn't say it harshly. But he was giving me feedback about something which he did not see me in that role, in a role that I really wanted. And I had to decide each time like, \"What do I do with this information?\" This is my dream job. Actually, I decided I was going to turn the job I had and the job I wanted, and that's a choice. I could have said, you know what? I can't have that job. I could go do something else, but I didn't. I took the job I had with the team I had and I turned it into this thing that was going to be something we wanted.\n\n(00:14:20):\nAnd so I think sometimes it's not... I think that that experience was a very humbling experience because to be told no and then to say that this will never happen was really hard. But at the same time it was a reminder that you're not right for every job even if you think you are. And that you can take the raw materials of what you have and turn it into what you want.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:40):\nAre you able to share what those jobs were that you wanted to get that you never got?\n\nDeb Liu (00:14:44):\nI never actually shared it publicly, but it's something which I had always had a role where I did new things for the company and there was a role where it was running something which more of an existing business, but I had always been kind of the innovator, the new stuff person. I had taken over so many new things. And so maybe that wasn't the right thing at the right time for me, but it was something that was really incredible and a turning point for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:08):\nGreat segue to an area I wanted to spend some time on which is building zero to one stuff within a larger company. So from what I can tell you built 2 billion businesses within a large company, Facebook marketplace, and then the ads platform within Facebook and maybe more. I don't know, the payments stuff, the games. I don't know. Maybe there's billions of dollars there I don't even know about. And this is very rare and very hard, and it's something we talk a little bit on this podcast, just the skills to build something new.\n\n(00:15:38):\nI know with marketplace it was not something people believed in for a long time. It took a lot of work to convince people to actually give it a shot. So I guess the question here is just what have you found are key tactics to start something new and allow it to continue to exist and get to a place where people start to believe it? What has worked for you?\n\nDeb Liu (00:15:57):\nSo first, I didn't build the ads platform. I actually built the first direct response ad product company ever had. But we'll talk about how that led to why direct response is a vast majority of the ads revenue for the company. But one thing that it was really interesting is that I really saw my opportunity in Facebook to be somebody that zigged when other people zagged. There were amazing people who did a lot of the really core products working on feed, photos, videos.\n\n(00:16:25):\nI came in actually on the payments team and we worked on payments and eventually built games, which was the first billion dollar business. It was very successful. We worked with the likes of all the game companies that were on the Canvas games platform",

It was very successful. We worked with the likes of all the game companies that were on the Canvas games platform. And it was just an incredible opportunity to start from scratch and built something really cool. We built Facebook credits, which eventually became the Facebook payment system.\n\n(00:16:47):\nAnd then from there on I built the first direct response ads product. And again, leveraging the skills that we had, we had a lot of relationships with game companies because of my time and payments. And so we just said, \"Hey look, what ad product do you want?\" And they said, \"Actually, your biggest challenge is the shift to mobile. Build us a mobile acquisition engine.\" And we said, \"That's doable.\"\n\n(00:17:09):\nAt the time the company was very brand oriented. Most of the ads... Actually almost all the ads on the platform were brand and we were not even on the ads team. So we actually worked on this team called the platform team. We said, \"Okay, we'll build an ads product for the Facebook feed, the new mobile Facebook feed.\" And suddenly it became a billion dollar business within about 18 months, which was such an incredible journey.\n\n(00:17:30):\nWe worked on the mobile advertising platform, so basically the mobile ads network. That was a great experience. And so each time I worked on something, it was just... The thing that you have to remember is the failure rate for something like this is very high. You start something and the amount of iteration... People think, \"Oh yeah, it's easy.\" You start something and it's linear because you have all the resources of this company behind you. But actually everything in the company is like, \"Let's do the most important thing.\"\n\n(00:17:58):\nThese are seeds and we'll just let them... And so if you do that, you have to know that you don't get a lot of resources, you get a lot of attention. And I appreciated that because I think I work best when people aren't... There is not a lot of scrutiny. I think sometimes large companies, they say, \"Well this innovation team,\" and then they check in on them way too much. They're like, \"Week to week progress, where are you going? What's your strategy?\" But so much as you know of building something new is the iteration process. It's the failing a lot.\n\n(00:18:27):\nWe actually tested five or six versions of the ads product before we got it to take off and it took months, and then we were on the verge of death multiple times. In fact, I actually went back to run the payments team while I was working on that product because the team we had gathered still want to continue working on it, but I needed a second job back on the payments team because they asked me, \"We don't think this thing is going to work. You should go run your old team again.\" And I thought, \"Well, I will do both.\"\n\n(00:18:52):\nAnd so I did both for a while until it really took off. The thing that I think a lot of large companies don't realize is that you can love something to death. And so with every new product, I'd rather do it out of the limelight, do it with the minimal resources and have the freedom to fail because success and failure really is... In startups, failing fast is really important or succeeding fast.\n\n(00:19:18):\nIt's the long slog that makes it really hard. In a company, you end up getting cut if you're the long slog product. And so being able to just say, \"You know what? We're pruning this. We're doing the next thing, the next thing.\" And then having the time to iterate and grow is really critical.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:33):\nSo as a leader trying to do this and create space for this, is there something you've learned about how to allow for, \"Don't over scrutinize us, don't look at us too carefully. We don't want to be in the limelight. Don't put too many resources on this yet.\" Is it just like, \"Hey, Mark. Here's what I think.\" I imagine it's not as easy as that. There's a lot of influence and that kind of work. Is there any tactics that you could share to create this sort of environment?\n\nDeb Liu (00:19:59):\nI think the most important part of the environment is really patience. And again, this is a portfolio strategy and I tell every PM who... I used to do a new hire PM class and I say, \"Look, a lot of you are going to go into the core product and your job is to grow X by 3 to 5% every six months. Growing engagement or growing sessions or maybe growing video views or whatever your metric is, you're trying to grow something 5% and then you exceed expectations.\"\n\n(00:20:27):\nAnd I said, \"And then a bunch of you are like, 'I want to do something new. I want to build something from scratch.'\" And I said, \"By the way, a very, very successful company for a new set of products has a 50% hit rate. So half of you are going to come back in a year and have a different job because that did not work out. Do you have the resilience to do that?\" And I think somebody, you enter a large company... By the way",

By the way, you can have an amazing career building core products because that is an incredible journey within... Because you learn so much about the mechanics of what that takes.\n\n(00:20:59):\nAnd yet at the same time, I found a lot of energy from doing something that someone hasn't done before. And so I really enjoyed the, \"Hey, this thing could fail. Let's pivot. Let's try to figure out. Let's prune this. Let's try that.\" And not everything I did there succeeded, but a lot of the things that are the lasting products are once that gotten really big. And so for me it was a greater reward and it made a journey so much more interesting.\n\n(00:21:24):\nBut for others, I think work on the core product, learn the skills. It is absolutely respectable as well. But if you choose to be the person who works on innovation new products, expect in a year, you might literally have nothing to show for it, but the lessons that you learned. And I think those lessons are really precious and we often underestimate that too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:42):\nAlong those lines, do you think it's a good career move to do a zero to one thing within a bigger company? Or is it often a bad idea? Do you have any advice there for folks?\n\nDeb Liu (00:21:52):\nIt depends. It depends on your personality in the company. So the one thing I realized about my role was that I did a lot of... I had five different careers at the company over 11 years. And so most people don't realize that when you work on new things, you're constantly adding to your portfolio, subtracting from it, growing things, pruning them. And so you could just work on so many cool things except everything has similar... It's like it rhymes, but it's not exactly the same.\n\n(00:22:19):\nSo you learn the lessons of how to get things done, how to get resource, how to get support when the product is not working, how to not get prunes in the next culling. And those are really, really important skills. But I think for people who are just starting out of the career, it is a very high risk thing to do. So if you're very early in the career, I encourage people just learn the core skills first. You can learn the core skills when there's a lot of stability. This product is growing X percent, like 5%, and you're going to grow at 10. That's amazing.\n\n(00:22:47):\nThat is because you are there, you're going to change your trajectory of the product, or this thing has a hundred thousand users, you're going to get it to 200,000. Those are the kinds of things that are going to be successful for you and you can put on your resume. But I think it reaches a point in your career where you have to decide, when am I going to take the big swing? Because the big swings are the things that you write your career stories about. They're not just, I moved this metric X, but I changed your trajectory in this way.\n\n(00:23:17):\nAnd so the big swings though have a lot of failures along the way. And so you have to understand you're making trade-offs in that. I encourage everybody to take some time, two, three years in their career when they're ready for the big swing, where if it doesn't work... If it works, you run the team, you run this amazing product. It doesn't work, you can always go back and go back to the core products.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:39):\nIt's interesting how your strategy here is very similar to a product portfolio strategy where as a team should have a few big bets and then a lot of incremental stuff. And it reminds me about this awesome post called You Are in Control of Your Career. And the argument in your post is you should PM your career the way you PM your product. So there's a lot of synergy here. So maybe just diving into this post and advice around this, how should someone be PMing their career, the way they PM a product? What's your take there?\n\nDeb Liu (00:24:05):\nBy the way, for your PM audience, I want to say this, which is a lot of the greatest PMs are the worst PMs of their careers. They love products. They love the crafts. They love the customer research, the data. They have plans, they have timelines. And then when it comes to career, they have none of those things. They just drift from job to job. \"Hey, should I take this role or this role? How do I think about this?\" But if I said you had to write a spec for your career, what's in there? What are your milestones? What are the skills? What are the features that you want to have of your career? How are you going to get there? What does success look like?\n\n(00:24:41):\nYou actually have metrics for your product, and yet you don't have metrics for your career. I coach a lot of people and when I coach them, I ask them, \"Well, where do you want to see yourself in five years? Where do you want to go?\" And half the people have no idea. I",

I coach a lot of people and when I coach them, I ask them, \"Well, where do you want to see yourself in five years? Where do you want to go?\" And half the people have no idea. I think that's really tragic because when you PM your career, it's about intentionality. But I'll tell you the story of my career and how I was the accidental PM and then eventually... I told you how I accidentally fell into PM, but also fell into so many of the things that happened in my PM career.\n\n(00:25:10):\nAnd if I had to go back, I would think much more deeply about what I want to accomplish. So I ended up at PayPal working for a guy named Dave Lee who reported to Amy Clement, and then he left. And so she offered me his role. I had only managed people for, I don't know, 15 seconds. I was two years out of business school and I was definitely not qualified to do his job. He was the director of product. I wasn't even a director and I was running the team for eBay.\n\n(00:25:34):\nSo basically the PayPal part of eBay, which was basically half the company's revenues and profits. Totally unqualified. I ended up in this job and I do a good job. I ended up doing it for several years. I built up the team and we have a great relationship with eBay. Our team was very close and we were able to actually build something really lasting that worked really well. And then I had a baby. And so this happens in a lot of women's careers. I was turning 30, I had my son, and I had to leave for six months.\n\n(00:26:08):\nSo I handed my product to my successor, Mike Woo and he ended up taking over. He did such a good job while I was gone, I didn't want to displace him when I got back. And so I thought, \"Well, I'll go and look for another role.\" I couldn't really find a product role I liked, I mean, because there weren't that many product director roles. And so I ended up in corporate strategy. So I worked for the amazing Rajiv who was CEO at the time. He since passed and I wrote his speeches, worked on strategies, I worked on digital goods and charity, and ended up building that into a vertical for the company. So charity, social commerce and digital goods.\n\n(00:26:40):\nAnd I thought, \"Okay, this is an interesting job.\" So I create the job, have a couple product managers, wasn't really sure where this was going, and then one day I was like, \"You know what? I'm not feeling this. I have a child at home.\" I had gotten into what Cheryl Sandberg calls that kind of between kids situation where I was bored of my job.\n\n(00:26:59):\nI was working one of the VPs I worked with and I resigned. I said, \"I'm leaving tech, just I'm going to stay home and maybe start something small.\" He convinced me to hold off and he said, I'll find you a job. He calls me a week later and he said, \"Found you a job with Stephanie Tilenius leading the buyer experience at eBay product.\" And I said, \"Oh, that sounds interesting.\" So I said, \"Sure, as you notice, I do not have a plan. I'm just drifting. I'm so fortunate that I had amazing mentors who gave me opportunities, but end up working for Greg Fant and Stephanie Tilenius at eBay for two years.\n\n(00:27:34):\nI led the buyer experience. We did some really good work there. And then went on maternity leave again. And I get a call from a friend, my old engineering manager from PayPal, \"Hey, I'm at Facebook. Do you want to come? You can't come into product. You need a CS degree for that, but we have a product marketing job open.\" I was like, \"Sounds good.\" Drop into Facebook. And so again, no idea what I'm doing back in product marketing. So I spent a few years doing that. Eventually was invited into product and so on and so forth.\n\n(00:28:02):\nAnd each job that came along was organic, but also kind of accidental. I see that happen in a lot of careers, which is my story when you look back, looks great. It looks like it all worked out, but I had almost zero intentionality in any of these. And I think that had I had more agency and I thought about what I wanted, I could actually measure is this the thing that would get me further or not?\n\n(00:28:24):\nI ended up extremely lucky, but not everybody does. And so I think having a plan allows you to compare every decision. It's not like when you're offered an admission to college, we're looking at three different offers maybe with financial aid or not, and you can make a decision, \"Oh, they're offering me this department, but I can't get into this department.\" This is how far it is from home. But jobs and roles or nothing like that. Someone calls you one day, \"Hey, I'm at Facebook. Do you want to come? I'm actually on maternity leave.\" And he's like, \"Just come talk to me.\" I'm like, \"Why not.\"\n\n(00:29:00):\nAnd you end up dropping into different parts of your life and I think sometimes by saying, \"Here's where I want to go and here's how I want to",

And so I do encourage everybody to do this and to think about what does success look like in five years and how far am I from that and am I heading in the right direction?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:20):\nWhat's interesting is I also had a similar path to you where I had zero plan or intention or goal and also just follow things and things worked out. I wonder how often that happens and I wonder if this idea of having intention and planning a roadmap is something you do if things aren't working out because maybe there's some good to not overthinking it and just following pull. I don't know.\n\nDeb Liu (00:29:45):\nWell, I think the problem is this with you and me, Lenny, is that hindsight bias is a problem. We made it because we weren't intentional in a lot of ways, but for how many people, is that true? For how many people who aren't... You don't have a plan and you get there. I always tell people, if you are sure what your destination is, that's definitely where you're going to end up. But if you actually aim in the right direction, you can shape your learnings, you can shape your roles you take, you can shape your skills towards the place that you want to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:16):\nWhen you talk about getting this offer from Facebook, usually those are like you have three days to decide.\n\nDeb Liu (00:30:21):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:22):\nAnd it feels like that's when the things you've done ahead of time of here's what I want would be most helpful.\n\nDeb Liu (00:30:29):\nAlso, I think the thing about job opportunities in particular is they tend to come serially. It's only you presented these offers. It's like one role is so different from another and they often don't happen at the same time. They might say, \"Well, you have to decide in two weeks.\" And then you say, \"Well, there's this other company I'm talking to and you get a lot of pressure to say yes to this versus this.\"\n\n(00:30:49):\nAnd to really having a measuring stick is this getting me closer or further away from where I go? Can allow you to actually take serial decision making to a place where you're measuring against a long-term goal.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:01):\nI did a meditation retreat once and when you're meditating, there's this kind of guidance of don't try too hard, don't push yourself to go into a direction, \"Oh, I'm not doing a good job. I need to get to this enlightened state.\" And instead their advice is just push your cart in a direction and think about that's the direction you want head, but you don't need to grasp on to here's where I need to land, here's where I need to go. And I wonder if just having a thought of here's where I want my career to go. I want to be on boards in the future. I want to start a company in the future. I want to become a designer in the future. At least start there maybe just like a direction that you're heading.\n\nDeb Liu (00:31:40):\nYeah. There's a woman who I worked with in product and now she's the founder, very successful founder, and she said to me, \"I want to join the board of this Fortune 100 company.\" She told me the company, and I said, \"Okay, that's a lot.\" So she said, \"How can I get there?\" And I said, \"First, it's probably going to take you 10 years because look at who's on the board. I happen to know a couple people on the board.\" And I said, \"Why don't I introduce you to one of them? And they can tell you how to get there.\n\n(00:32:04):\nBut the point is she knew where she wanted to go and she said, \"I'm willing to take it first step today.\" And I said, \"First, you've never been on a board. You were very successful, but this is not... There's so many steps before you get there. It's like before you go to Harvard, you have to graduate from elementary school to middle school. You have to take the SAT, you have to apply. I said, \"Let's start from the first step and let's break this problem down.\"\n\n(00:32:29):\nBut I love that she knew where she wanted to go and she's like, \"Even if I don't make it there, I'll be happier having made this journey.\" And I love that for her. And I think she's still earlier in her career, she has so much time ahead of her, but it's really incredible to see her kind of on this path and to know that that's her dream, and that I can help her a little bit along the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:48):\nIt also relates very much to your idea of thinking of your career like a PM thinks about their product where one of the tactics is to imagine the ideal scenario and work backwards from that versus incrementally what's the next thing? What's the next thing? So in this case, she was thinking, \"Here's where I want to head. Okay,",

Can you just talk about of your insight, what you've seen around this and how and your advice to introverts like me about how to be successful in business, what you need to change?\n\nDeb Liu (00:34:22):\nWell, first, I love the book, Quiet by Susan Cain. She talks about the power of introverts. Unfortunately, the world doesn't see the way the world the way she does. I wrote this post. It was the secret bias no one talks about, which is the workplace is really favoring people who can speak up. And I tell the story of somebody on my team who's just an amazing product manager, and yet every time she came up for promotion or calibration, people were like, \"Oh, what does she do?\" And it was because she was not good at broadcasting or explaining what she does.\n\n(00:34:54):\nI would take her to executive meetings and she was really bad at answering questions or talking. And so we would prep and prep and prep. I just knew her skills and I could see her every day moving the product forward. But for some reason people... Because your peers also have influence over people's ratings and their promotions, and I was constantly just trying to figure out how to get them to see her brilliance. I asked her once, I said, \"I noticed that you never answer questions when we do these presentations.\" She's like, \"Yeah, because I'm a processor. And by the time I process, I feel like the conversation has moved on.\"\n\n(00:35:28):\nAnd so I really feel like the world, it's not built for somebody like her who's a brilliant product leader, but people couldn't see it. And I realized that so much of what products and just general leadership is, is not just doing the work, but actually... It's not just having the product, it's having great product marketing to go with it. Let's call it that. Okay, so I've been in product and I've been product marketing. You make a light bulb, but you're selling light.\n\n(00:35:53):\nI really think about how that she was making amazing number of light bulbs. She was lighting up all the houses, but she was not marketing the light. And I think that was the thing that was really missing. Is that fair? Absolutely not. There are a lot of people who are born introverted. Is it fair that a product manager who isn't introverted, isn't extroverted is struggling with that? No, but that's the world we live in. And so it's one of those things where you get to choose what you do.\n\n(00:36:21):\nFirst, I think for the individual is realizing that you are your own best marketer. You have to actually share what you do. If a great product is out in the world, but no one is told about it, did it exist? And so one of the things that's very important is really to get that product marketing.\n\n(00:36:39):\nThe second part is we should change our workplaces so everyone can be successful. And I think that that's a really important skill. As more introverts get into leadership, they need to actually change the world to make more space for people like them as well. So one of the things that I found was in my leadership teams over the last several years, we had this thing where we all vote, but we vote offline in a document and we put a number in and then we put our comments in.\n\n(00:37:05):\nAnd that way everyone has an equal voice in this document. And then when we talk about it, usually, of course the extroverts speak first, but everyone has a vote and we can actually see what people's point of views are. And I love that. I love that when there's something we used to do at Facebook is we used to go around in a circle and everybody would give their opinion in a meeting. I do that still today. I ask every single person as a business leader at this company, would you do this?\n\n(00:37:30):\nAnd even I joke with our chief legal officer, Greg, I say, \"You are a business leader and the lawyer. You",

You can't just say, well, legal advises X.\" I'm like, \"But what would you do?\" And so nobody can take a backseat to decision making. Everybody has a voice. So there's so many of these kind of bias interrupters, things that we can do to actually make the world easier for those who weren't speaking up and taking 80% of the air in the room. And I do think that we have to craft a workplace where everyone can be their best.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:59):\nIn the post, you also talk about as much as we want to change the way people run their companies and think. I love your advice of you also still have to learn how to speak up and act more extroverted even though it's not natural to you. Is that right?\n\nDeb Liu (00:38:14):\nI think we do a disservice when we say we're not good at speaking up because it's a skill like any other. And if I told you the difference between your product being successful and not being successful is you giving this presentation, they're going to kill your product if you don't sell this to the executives. You would figure out a way to stand in front of those executives and defend the freaking heck out of your product. But why aren't you doing that every day?\n\n(00:38:35):\nAnd I think sometimes we forget that not everything is as essential as they're going to cut your product if you can't convince them to keep it. But every day you're actually building credibility for your team, getting more resources, getting more people to talk about your product inside your company, getting more press for the product outside. All of those things combined into momentum for your product. And don't you want the best thing for your product and your customers?\n\n(00:38:58):\nSo if you think about it that way, it's not, well, I'm uncomfortable. I hear this a lot where people say, \"Well, you wouldn't understand. I'm an introvert.\" And I'm like, \"So was I.\" But instead I just said, \"Okay, this is a necessary skill and it's a learnable skill. You don't have to be comfortable with it. You don't have to love it, but you just have to do it.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:19):\nWhat about from another perspective of why people don't do this, which is it feels like self-promotion and it feels like icky like, \"I'm just sitting around promoting myself. I don't want to be doing that.\" Anything there that helps people get over that piece?\n\nDeb Liu (00:39:31):\nWell, I just remember I was talking to this ERG group and I was asking about... There was an upcoming calibration and self reviews were due in a couple of days. And I said, \"Well, what are you doing for your self-review?\" And somebody raised their hand and said, \"Well, I'm really bad at self-promotion. What advice would you have for me?\" And I said, \"If you think your self-review is self-promotion, you're just not going to do a great job at it.\"\n\n(00:39:56):\nWhat if I called it educating your manager about all the great work your team has been doing? What if I called it helping people see why your team should get more resources? Suddenly you're cracking open, you're changing the question right from, \"Oh, I was self-promoting to actually I'm helping my team get more resources and support.\" And suddenly she was like, \"Oh yeah, I never thought about it that way.\"\n\n(00:40:22):\nBut I think often if you frame it one way, it looks like self-promotion. I wouldn't want to do that because of self-promotion. But at the same time, if it's education, what if I said, \"I was talking to a PM who's really incredible. I've mentored him and sponsored him for a long time.\" And I said, \"I don't understand why you don't have more of a voice. You've learned so much about the craft. You've done this at multiple companies.\" And he said exactly what you said which is I'm not really self-promoting.\n\n(00:40:46):\nAnd I said, \"If you see it as self-promoting, you will never do it.\" And so let's talk about why you don't actually do this. And he said, \"I've seen a lot of people who are really great on LinkedIn write these articles, but they have nothing to back it up.\" And I don't want to be like them. And I said, \"Okay. Well, you read my blog, you follow me on LinkedIn, do you think I have nothing to black back it up?\" And he's like, \"No, of course not.\"\n\n(00:41:07):\nAnd I said, \"Well, then why do you put yourself in his category instead of mine?\" And I think it was just a moment where we just came to an understanding where he in his mind was like, \"I don't want to be that person. It's an empty vessel that has no substance behind it.\" And I said, \"Do you think the things I write have no substance?\" But it was an interesting conversation because he had taken this mantle that it was self-promotion and that behind what if people think I'm nothing behind it?\"\n\n(00",

I have been your manager. I have worked with you for many years, but you see how just reframing it has really changed his way of thinking about it.\" Still working on him. But I actually think he has so much to give and I think he has learned so much about the craft, and I wish that more product managers feel comfortable that they have something to give to the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:53):\nI think what you're saying right now will resonate with a lot of people when they see people posting. I feel the still of just like, \"I don't want to be this guy that's just posting nonsense on LinkedIn just to get likes,\" even though it's kind of what I do now full time. Hopefully it's not nonsense.\n\nDeb Liu (00:42:08):\nBut it is all substance. So, Lenny, we know the substance behind it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:11):\nI tried, but I think there's posting on LinkedIn, posting on Twitter. There's like an innate just doing this because I want to get attention when often... And the way I started this is just like things I've learned that I think are useful, I'm just going to put them out there. So just to double click a little bit, I think this is a really powerful point. What actually have you found helps people get over that? Is it someone like you and his corner being like, \"You have really great stuff to share, you should actually do it. Don't be as worried as you are, as you think you might be.\" Is there anything else that works there?\n\nDeb Liu (00:42:41):\nActually what worked for me was I was working with Bos and I talk about our relationship in my book, but we made a contract when I started reporting to him. And Bos, for those of you don't know, is currently the CTO of Meta. At the time he was the head of ads and then our team moved into his team. And so I was reorged into his organization. And as I said we did not have the best relationship before that. And so we made a contract to work together and I had written like, \"Here's how I want you to take care of my team. Here's how I want you to support our products.\" And I wrote them this long, my part of the commitment.\n\n(00:43:13):\nThen he wrote back, \"Here's what I'm asking of you. I want you to write and publish something every month.\" I was like, \"What are you talking about? Why would you say that?\" He said, \"You have so much to teach people. Just do it.\" I said, \"I don't really have that much to say.\" And he's like, \"Just trust me on this. You'll figure it out.\" His advice was write what you repeat. If you say something more than once, just write it down. And then the next time someone asks you, you can just hand them.\n\n(00:43:40):\nHe has a great blog if you have read it. I just normally thinking that is a weird thing for your new manager to say after you had a lot of conflict together before that. But he took my contract, which was... By the way, he's like, \"Oh, do you want to codify this in some way?\" I'm like, \"No, I just...\" But every month from then on, I would literally just write something and it was my promise to him. And I did it faithfully and I published it internally. So I didn't publish it externally for a long time.\n\n(00:44:04):\nAnd then sometimes they would ask me if I want to publish it externally for the company and I would say yes. And so I did it for years. I reported to him for years. And then we switched managers. He moved over to Reality Labs and then I had a new manager and I continued and I continued this. Then I started doing a publicly, and then obviously I wrote a book. Because of him and his encouragement, it got me to a totally different place. And part of it was just the commitment. I now had accountability because I knew he was watching. I'm not actually sure if he was actually watching every month. But I felt the accountability to do this and I've done it every single month since.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:37):\nSo it's interesting that that's another example of your manager giving you the space slash forcing you to share publicly being a really good lever to get someone over this fear.\n\nDeb Liu (00:44:48):\nI think sometimes just doing it gets you over the hump. For example, my friend, Ami Vora. She writes an incredible blog. You have not read her Substack, you should. But she's an incredible writer. She'd write all these things internally and I said, \"You should publish this externally.\" Now she does that and it's really great. And I think part of it was just seeing her just put it out there because she is one of the wisest career coaches that I have and managers that I have ever worked with. And so I'm like, \"You have so much to say and to share.\"\n\n(00:45:16):\nSo to see",

And so I'm like, \"You have so much to say and to share.\"\n\n(00:45:16):\nSo to see it out there, I feel like for years we all got the benefit of it because we knew her. But the world was not getting the benefit. So in some ways just having accountability. So we created a little accountability group to help each other write, and it was just a reminder, \"Hey, did you do it?\" And so I think it's sometimes what's necessary to get over that hump is either having someone forcing you, like your manager who you made a commitment to, or just having a friend to say, \"Hey, by the way, where's this month's post?\"\n\n(00:45:41):\nThose things matter because now you got over the hump of, \"I have to do it.\" And now it's just about how good you're going to make it and how much time you're going to put into it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:49):\nAwesome advice. And by the way, folks don't know we've had both Bos and Ami on the podcast in the past.\n\nDeb Liu (00:45:55):\nAren't they both amazing?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:56):\nAmazing. And Ami's episode is one of the most popular episodes. More popular than Bos, CTO of Meta.\n\nDeb Liu (00:45:56):\nI know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:56):\nWho would've thought?\n\nDeb Liu (00:46:06):\nShe has a lot of coaching wisdom I think that everyone should hear.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:08):\nYeah, she's amazing. She has a great Substack. We'll link to it again in the show notes. We'll link to your Substack as well.\n\nDeb Liu (00:46:13):\nYeah, please do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:15):\nGo Substack. I want to move in a slightly different direction. Talk about growth for a little bit. You have a really nice perspective on how to think about growth. I think a lot of people think of growth as like, \"Here's a magic bullet. We're going to do this thing. It's going to go, \"Wow, we're going to win.\" And your approach is, you talk about it, it's a game of inches. Growth is a game of inches. Can you talk about your perspective there?\n\nDeb Liu (00:46:34):\nYeah. Sometimes we think it's like what is the huge step function? But actually most companies are like... We call it points of growth, right? It's like if you can move things 1% a little bit faster every single week, think about the amount of growth you get at the end. And so it's not just, \"Okay, what's going to get you the 3X? You can get to 3X 1% at a time, 5% at a time. Single digit growth. And sometimes it is the small things that matter the most. And so we think about product-led growth, it's really about finding the aha moments, the opportunities. And sometimes opportunities are things that seem really silly.\n\n(00:47:10):\nI heard the story at Facebook that one of the big things was just adding the, next to ads, they put the word create an ad, was one of the biggest growth drivers. And that was it just putting a link because people just didn't know how to get to the ads flow. It was things like that where you can actually bend the curve of choices that you make. Same thing, each of the growth teams I've ever worked on, it's like really the small things adding up. It is a list we used to work on payments growth and we had a list of a hundred things we were working on hypotheses.\n\n(00:47:42):\nAnd then we would pick and we would grow them by picking the first 10 and we would start working on them, the next 10, the next 10, and we would go through these sprint cycles. And the same thing when we were growing the ads product as well. Marketplace, each of them were just like, \"What are the small things that add up to big things?\" And I think sometimes we overthink it.\n\n(00:48:00):\nInstead, you probably have a hundred ideas. And by the way, it is absolutely okay if the 80% of them don't work. I tell people sometimes we overthink as product manager if we just had the perfect plan, the perfect battle plan, but instead imagine you're a team and you can ship, I don't know, let's say four things. But what if you're a team that can ship 20 things with the same with a 20% success. You get just as much output and yet you know what doesn't work also.\n\n(00:48:30):\nWhat if you can move it from 20% to 30%? Suddenly six things work, not just four things. And so in the same amount of time you have all the lessons of what didn't work, plus you're getting 50% more output. And so you thinking about growth as this engine of, it's a learning machine of what doesn't work, what you reiterate on, what you change, and you're constantly getting better and better and better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:50):\nI think what you're saying will resonate with a lot",

Still sucks, boring. Let's take some big bets.\" And in my experience, and sounds like in your experience, a lot of the wins actually... And Facebook is famous for this, just relentlessly looking for ways to grow, optimize, optimize, optimize because that's where a lot of growth comes from.\n\n(00:49:14):\nAt the same time, obviously you need to take some big bets and take some swings and look for step function changes. But I guess for someone that's just like... I don't know. Is there any advice on just creating that culture of like, \"It's okay to optimize for a long time, there's a lot of opportunity optimizing\"? Is there anything you've learned there or is it just bringing in a Deb and it has to be a top down?\n\nDeb Liu (00:49:32):\nI treat growth like, let's say, a product marketing team. It is an augmentation for a product that works. So if you have a core product that works, you have a team that's working on... So for us at Ancestry, it's like search and hints of the core. What is the mechanics? You want people to add people to their family tree. You want them to add stories, okay? There's teams that make sure that the uptime is good, that the hints are working, the search delivers results.\n\n(00:49:57):\nAnd you need those teams, you need those core teams kind of functioning. But growth is actually optimization on top. It is making it so that you get to the search flow faster. The hints are surfacing better, that people are accepting them, that if we put the button here versus here, that people are going to discover things faster. And so it's really taking the core engine and actually wrapping it around the user interface around the experience, around the flows so that people can get to it faster, they can have more satisfaction, they can have more impact. And that's what I see growth as. It's not the core product. It is the cherry on top, making that product more accessible and more usable and better every single day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):\nAlong these lines, I think it surprised people to learn. There's at least a hundred people at our Airbnb just working on pricing, optimizing pricing recommendations. There's endless opportunity to just make all these core components of an experience better and better and better over time. Okay. Last thing I want to talk about, and this is completely unrelated to everything we've been talking about mostly, which is your 30, 60, 90-day plan.\n\n(00:51:00):\nSo you wrote this post a while ago, just like, here's a great 30, 60, 90-day plan when you join a company. I've heard that many people use this. It's really effective for helping someone onboard and be successful. And I think it's mostly for execs or is this for just anyone joining a company?\n\nDeb Liu (00:51:16):\nIt's for anyone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:17):\nOkay, anyone.\n\nDeb Liu (00:51:18):\nI created, it's actually when I joined Ancestry because I hadn't started a real new job in 11 years. And I thought, I'm going to be a student of how to land well. So I read a bunch of things, I read and I decided I was going to adapt all of those things into a summary and then I was going to try it real time in my blog.\n\n(00:51:38):\nSo in my blog I write, \"Here's what I'm going to do,\" and then I tell you what I did and how it worked and some things. And then I actually do a look back as to all the mistakes I made. And so I did this live. It was not planned quite as well as I would thought, but I put it together and I wrote the 30, 60, 90-day plan and I have a template. I always tell people it's focused on listening and learning first and then doing. So that's the crux of it, which is in those 90-days it's like you got to get used to the environment. You want to have some impact at the start. You want to have a couple quick wins, but you want to understand the lay of the land and you want to listen because you have something to contribute.\n\n(00:52:19):\nBut if you don't understand the language, you don't understand the culture, you might actually make huge mistakes. And so for the first 30 days, I did a listening tour. I talked to over 60 people in 30 days and then I summarized a state of the union. Here's what I'm hearing, here are the challenges people feel like we're facing. Here's what people's wishlists are. And by the way, one person sent me a wishlist of five things and at that year, I think it took me till year two to finish his five things. And then I sent him a note. I said, \"By the way, the first time we met, these five things you wanted to see, we just finished the last one.\"\n\n(00:52:50):\nAnd he's like, \"I can't believe you remember.\" I took extensive notes and I",

I think it's important because people want to hear that you hear them. And you don't have to be a manager or CEO to do that. I think people on teams often feel like there's no outlet for the things that they want to say. I encourage, especially product leaders, especially if you're joining an existing team, to listen really behind what people are saying and then offer to help them do one thing.\n\n(00:53:17):\nSo especially when you're meeting with a new engineering team for the first time, actually ask them, what is one thing I can do to help you this week? I always say one thing, it's limited. This week, so getting 15 new headcount. Probably not going to happen. And it's like, how can I give back? And suddenly you're building a reciprocal relationship. And so a lot of this 30, 60, 90-day plan is really to help you find your footing and then to start having impact immediately.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:43):\nSay you join a company and you're like, \"I'm going to do 30 days listening,\" and then your boss is like, \"No, we need to ship stuff. Get on it, ship this stuff.\" Is there any advice for trying to push back on that, create space for listening when there's deadlines, things aren't [inaudible 00:53:56]?\n\nDeb Liu (00:53:57):\nI encourage everybody to get on the same page on this 30, 60, 90-day plan with their manager. So actually don't just keep it to yourself. Share it with as many people as you can. So I think it's very important that everyone sees what you're trying to accomplish and what your output is going to be. Because if you don't know the output, is success there? The second part is with your manager say, \"Okay. I would like to carve 20% of my time listening and I'm happy to do this work 80% of the time.\" Therefore every morning from nine to 10, I want to talk to somebody in the organization.\n\n(00:54:28):\nJust make sure you say, \"I will do a better job and have more impact if I have this time to make sure that I'm not accidentally making mistake or I don't get a chance, I'm asking something of somebody, but I've never met them.\" And to really carve out space because it's really important. Once you're in it, people give you the new person card for maybe a month or two and then suddenly it's all the problems are your problems.\n\n(00:54:53):\nBut what if you don't know what the problems are? And so I always say diagnose before you treat. So make sure you understand so that you can help and deliver what your manager is actually expecting of you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:04):\nI'm looking at your template. So just to share the bucket. So first 30 days learning focus, second 30 days is aligning on vision for the future, and the last 30 days of the 90 days is executing, setting up, actually starting to get stuff done. Awesome. Anything else along these lines of this?\n\nDeb Liu (00:55:23):\nThe one thing about having a plan also is that you don't feel rushed to do something that you're not ready for because I do think sometimes you feel like you need to have impact. I always tell people, \"Do something small, give back in some ways that people see you making.\" But when you actually reflect, one of the biggest things I could do was actually reflect back to the organization, \"Here's what I heard from all of you. I'm listening, I hear this and here's what I want to do about it.\"\n\n(00:55:53):\nAnd then in aligning it's like, \"Do we agree this is a set of problems we want to tackle?\" And then an execution is like, \"Do we agree that this is how we want to move forward?\" And I think that is such an important part of building into a team. When you enter an organization, you're also entering a team and you're part of a dance that's going around. What role do you play? And people are dancing around you and if you actually make a mistake, you could trip other people up as well. So really finding your place in the dance is really important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:21):\nAnd as a PM, the way I always think about is people won't assume they should trust you. You're just this person that's coming in to tell them what to do and so much of your first month, two, three is building that trust with people so that they can actually feel comfortable listening to your guidance and not just like, \"Oh my god. This person is getting in my way.\"\n\nDeb Liu (00:56:40):\nAnd earning that trust, sometimes people really... You'd be really surprised, a lot of people feel like they're not heard and even just coming in and listening is a trust building exercise.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:51):\nSuch a good point. As we wrap up our conversation, just a couple more questions here. So first is I want to take us to Contrarian Corner, which is a segment on this podcast. And my question is there something that you",

You'd be really surprised, a lot of people feel like they're not heard and even just coming in and listening is a trust building exercise.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:51):\nSuch a good point. As we wrap up our conversation, just a couple more questions here. So first is I want to take us to Contrarian Corner, which is a segment on this podcast. And my question is there something that you believe that you think most other people don't believe? Something that you think is a contrarian perspective?\n\nDeb Liu (00:57:10):\nI don't know if this is a contrarian perspective, but I go to speak in a lot of universities. So I speak at Stanford and I'm going to speak at Duke. And I always tell people, especially young people, the most important career decision you make is who you marry. And it's not something we think that much about, especially I started dating... I met my husband when I was 18, my first weekend in college. Started dating when I was 19. We had no idea what our life was going to be like and yet every single day like this week we had our board meeting, I was in Utah the whole week. I come home and he's taking care of everything.\n\n(00:57:43):\nYou will have a much more successful career if your home life is in balance. It's like a yin and a yang. If something is out of balance, it engulfs the other side. Both your job and your home life. And especially, we have three kids. Really balancing that is very hard over both of us having demanding careers. It's not something that's contrarian, but it's something which we don't think about at all when we make that decision. We think is this person fun to be with? Is this person somebody we see ourselves with? But my question is what is the impact of this relationship on your career?\n\n(00:58:14):\nIs this person lifting you up or pushing you back? Is this person someone who's going to be your greatest cheerleader or are they going to be the greatest weight on you? How do you think that that's going to manifest itself 20 years, 30 years from now? And I think it's just something I wish we thought about more and I encourage especially young people to think about that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:33):\nSuch a great point. What I want now is a guide for vetting these things when you're dating. Deb's guide to dating.\n\nDeb Liu (00:58:44):\nI need to write that. Although I've only really dated him, the one person, so maybe I am like the worst person to tell.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:49):\nBut it worked, so you're maybe the best person and now you look back.\n\nDeb Liu (00:58:49):\nThat's right. That's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:53):\nAnd here's the questions I asked that worked. That's so funny. Okay, so before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you think might be helpful to share, something you might want to leave listeners with? Any other nuggets of wisdom or advice?\n\nDeb Liu (00:59:08):\nWell, there's one quote which I share, I thought about when you were speaking earlier, which is about people who are resilient, which is life... This is a quote from Chuck Swindoll, he's a Christian writer I used to read a lot and it was, \"Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.\" And I just looked him up recently and he actually published a book with that quote. He actually had that quote in a previous book from 20 years ago.\n\n(00:59:34):\nAnd I just think that's so important. You don't get to choose everything that happens in your life. So much is just, it just happens, but it's the people who choose a way forward to turn stumbling blocks and the stepping stones. As I said, \"Somebody who actually says, 'you know what? I didn't get the job that I wanted and I'm just going to figure out another path,' those are the people who have the most successful and satisfying careers.\" They're thinking when other people are zagging vice versa. And I think that there are the ones who are the most resilient and happy in the long term.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:06):\nIt's such a good circle back to one of your first pieces of advice of just most successful people are people that are resilient and don't avoid failure, but embrace it and find a way to turn that around. I think it's such an important point. It's so hard to do. I guess just, I don't know, just to follow this thread a little bit, is there anything that has helped you build that? Has that always been the way your mind worked? I imagine coaching helps this, helps people with this.\" Is there anything just like that?\n\nDeb Liu (01:00:29):\nCoaching is incredible for that. We joke it's work therapy, but really I think it's... For a long time I saw failure as this catastrophic thing. I was one of those kids who's like, \"You never got a B until...\" Then I got to college and I was like, \"Wow, this is harder than I thought.\" And so I got two B's in college and I'm like, \"I'm never doing that again.\" But I was that kid who always got the A, who got the great scores. I just thought that my life would end if I got a B which by the way is super unhealthy.\n\n(01:01:00):\nAnd looking back, I realized that work is not like",

I just thought that my life would end if I got a B which by the way is super unhealthy.\n\n(01:01:00):\nAnd looking back, I realized that work is not like that at all. And every time I got bad feedback I'm like, \"This is catastrophic.\" But if you look at feedback as an opportunity, then it's very different. It's like this is a gift. I would be crushed. Every time I get a review no matter what rating I got, I would read the things that people would say and I was like, \"Oh my gosh, I'm a terrible person.\" And I had to really rethink that. And I think coaching, leadership coaching has really helped me through that to say, \"No, how do you process this and how do you get to the other side?\"\n\n(01:01:33):\nAnd that has been so transformative for me is to have that outlet to actually talk through. No, no, no. What they're saying is not that you're a bad product person, it's that you need to do a better job communicating or connecting. And I really struggled with that. I was very transactional. I was not a connector. I was not warm. I really struggled with relationships. And a lot of the feedback I received for many years is this relationship issue. And it took me a long time to realize that people aren't saying this because I'm a bad person or that they hate me, but because they want to connect.\n\n(01:02:03):\nI was actually making it hard. And I think sometimes we take things so personally that it becomes kind of this thing. It is your white whale. It's like the thing you're chasing, but then what if you say, \"You know what, I don't need to do that. I don't need to chase that. Instead I need to figure out what's behind the feedback and what are they trying to say?\" And then actually change yourself over a long period of time towards that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:26):\nI had similar challenges where I had this pretty real imposter syndrome for a while when I started doing well. And a coach was the key for me to help me get over that and see that if I made a mistake. Things wouldn't crumble. And that it's very normal to make mistakes. Nobody will-\n\nDeb Liu (01:02:43):\nAnd by the way, I think perfectionism is a curse we place on ourselves. And it's a very dangerous thing, particularly for product leaders because product managers, you know things are going to go wrong. That's literally part of your job. And yet when we have perfectionism, it is a lack of trust in our ability to bounce back and our ability to actually adapt. But the more adaptable you are, the less you have to be perfect every single time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:09):\nJust to leave people with a tactical piece of advice, say they are like, \"Oh man, I need a coach,\" do you have any advice for how to find a coach? How to explore that route?\n\nDeb Liu (01:03:17):\nSo I actually wrote an article, because one of the things I struggle with coaching is very expensive often, and not every company provides it. My husband actually works at a coaching company called Sounding Board to make it more accessible. But one of the things I encourage people to do is there are other ways to get coaches. I'm in a lean-in group and we are just like, we support each other. I'm in a coaching circle in YPO, so that's a group of CEOs. And I'm in a number of these coaching circles, which give you an opportunity to learn from each other and to get pure coaching. And I think that's a great place to start, especially early in your career when you're seeing the same people making the same mistakes.\n\n(01:03:54):\nI think as you get more senior, having an individual coach helps because the situations are so much more unique. But I do think that having that outlet, having a place to say, \"Hey, is it me or is this situation not right? And how should I think through this?\" That's so incredibly important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:10):\nI'm listening to this book, or reading a book called Listen right now that a previous guest recommended. It's a parenting book and it's about just the power of listening and how much that solves many problems with your challenges or with your child. When your child is having a problem just listening to them. There's a lot of power. This came from a coach that was on the podcast recently. [inaudible 01:04:31]\n\nDeb Liu (01:04:30):\nSounds great. I'll definitely, I'll read it or listen to it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:34):\nI know it's weird. I'm like reading, it's called Listen. He's like, \"This is the only parenting book you need really. It solves all the problems that we deal with.\" So anyway, that was an awesome final nugget that I'm glad we got there. With that though, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nDeb Liu (01:04:52):\nLet's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:53):\nLet's do it. First question, what are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people?\n\nDeb Liu (01:04:59):\nSo I love the book from Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer. I speak in his class",

First question, what are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people?\n\nDeb Liu (01:04:59):\nSo I love the book from Professor Jeffrey Pfeffer. I speak in his class now that I read it way before that, it's called Power: Who Has It and Why. I love the book. He actually has the more practical one, 7 Rules of Power, which came out more recently. And so it's a book that reminds us that power is not accidental, that people often get it for different reasons and how you should think about the playing field.\n\n(01:05:23):\nAnother book is The Conversation, Dr. Livingston wrote that about race in America, and I just love that it's a very honest assessment of race in America. It's hard to have that conversation and I love that he uses a lot of facts and encourages people to open up and have conversations around it. And then the last one I would say is, well, Susan Cain's Quiet. I adore the book because I do have introverted kids. I myself am introverted and just to read the power of introverts as a reminder that we do have amazing people who don't communicate the same way.\n\n(01:05:59):\nI love that it's a tribute to the success of those. Even if our workplace is not adapted to it, I do think we need to adapt to it so that we can bring the best in everybody. But her book is a reminder that there's so much power even in silence.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:13):\nThe first book you mentioned Jeffrey Pfeffer, he's been on the podcast. I think he may have mentioned you in our conversation or-\n\nDeb Liu (01:06:17):\nI love Professor Pfeffer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:19):\nThat was a fun conversation because I came into it very nervous for what his advice would be and then came up with it being like, \"This is great. This is-\"\n\nDeb Liu (01:06:28):\nHe is very wise,\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:29):\nHe's very wise and just very, \"I don't care what you think, I'm just going to tell you the reality of the world.\" Oh man. Okay. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nDeb Liu (01:06:41):\nOkay. I know this is a fandom thing, but I love Fallout. So I played the game Fallout 4 last year, and then the show came out and it was amazing. And I know that sounds so nerdy, but it was incredible. And I know that video game movie annotations tend to be terrible, but it was so great and having played the game it was even better. Is that super nerdy?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:06):\nNo, I watched Fallout. I don't know anything about the game, but the show itself was really fun. Just I had no idea what I was even getting into. So no. Acceptable nerdy level. I don't know if you can get too nerdy on this show. Next question, do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you just really like?\n\nDeb Liu (01:07:26):\nWell, so actually what's really interesting is I never got into Twitter. I just couldn't figure it out. Recently I really got into Threads and I didn't think I would. I was like, \"Well, just post some stuff on it,\" but really I just love... I could never figure out Twitter. You follow the wrong person and the whole thing, it's terrible. If somebody is posting too much or too little, but there's something about the Threads algorithm that's really worked. The first few months wasn't quite there, but I just feel like it's spot on and now I see the magic of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:59):\nThat's so interesting. I've seen some stats that it's bigger than X now slash Twitter and I wonder if that's true. I got to look that up, but I've seen more activity on Threads. So maybe I need to go back there. I spent some time around-\n\nDeb Liu (01:08:10):\nCheering from the sidelines that it's successful because I use it a lot now. And I guess I had never had a place for realtime news and it's not exactly meant to be newsy, but maybe it's just who I follow, but I love just seeing like, \"Here's five headlines you probably missed.\" And I was like, \"Oh.\" I know they're trying to downplay politics, but I just love that it feels like you get a glimpse of what's going on in the world in five minutes.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:35):\nOkay. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about, come back to, share with friends or family find useful in work or in life?\n\nDeb Liu (01:08:42):\nOoh, that's a good question. Well, actually, I would say that it's very similar to the Chuck Swindoll one about life. So we can use that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:52):\nGreat. That's what I imagined because you shared that one early on. And I imagine that was going to be your answer. Final question, you started Facebook Marketplace, you built it. Now, it has a billion users, more than that. What's the most interesting thing that you have bought or sold on Facebook",

Now, it has a billion users, more than that. What's the most interesting thing that you have bought or sold on Facebook Marketplace?\n\nDeb Liu (01:09:07):\nThe best thing I ever sold on there was I sold my minivan on it and in four days. I made my husband do it because I wanted him to test the product. We were selling our minivan and I'm like, \"Just try Facebook Marketplace.\" He's like, \"I don't know about this.\" And he's like, \"There's too many people contacting me. I needed it to stop.\" So it worked really well for us. I think I have bought so many things on there. It's actually sort of embarrassing.\n\n(01:09:30):\nRecently, my daughter wanted the same desk as I had for her new room and they no longer sell it at Costco. And I found it for half the price from a woman who was moving and she's like, \"Here,\" and I love it. So I bought probably way too many things on Facebook Marketplace actually. But it's a great thing. I actually use it as a great rental for kid stuff because you buy a kid's bike and then when they outgrow it, you sell it back.\n\n(01:09:56):\nAnd the rental fee is almost free and I don't have the store all of it. So I love every part of it. I still am an admin user and I send a lot of feedback back to that team still.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:06):\nThat's amazing. Deb, this was amazing. I'm so happy we made time for this. Thank you so much for coming on. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out, maybe read about stuff you're doing? Where's your Substack and anything else people can check out?\n\nDeb Liu (01:10:18):\nYeah, so debliu.substack if you want to look. I post probably about once a week. I'm on LinkedIn, I'm on Threads, so please do find me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:27):\nAnd then the actual final question, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nDeb Liu (01:10:33):\nWell, I would just love to hear what you heard from today that resonated with you and what you're going to do with it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:37):\nAnd how would they share that LinkedIn or at Threads?\n\nDeb Liu (01:10:41):\nI'm happy to read your comments or send it if you want to-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:41):\nThere we go.\n\nDeb Liu (01:10:43):\n... send it to me. If you've actually subscribed to my Substack, you can just reply to the first email and then I get it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:48):\nAwesome.

I think that's what many, many founders are looking for is how do I avoid pain?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:00:11):\nTo be a founder is a state of being, it's an attitude. To be a CEO is a craft. The more founders who can accept that those are two separate things and they're both equally important to build an ascendant startup, the better all of us will be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):\nI'm kind of tired of talking about founder mode, but it feels like what you're describing is founder mode and manager mode.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:00:30):\nFounder mode gets me angry. That article just got me hot. It really felt like an excuse. We were giving founders a permission to not learn the job. It's not manager mode is bad, it's the greatest CEOs know when to calibrate which one is needed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:46):\nSomething you talk about, there's these two phases to a startup journey and most people focus on the first phase.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:00:51):\nPhase one is build something people want to buy. Phase two, the one we don't talk about is now you have to build a company around that thing people want to buy. Building a company is always the same. I don't care if it's MedTech or fintech or hardware or consumer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):\nYou've come up with this methodology that you call the Magic Box paradigm that helps founders think about how to lead to a successful exit long-term.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:01:11):\nThis is a traditional sales process. You build a list of the companies that might want to acquire you, you ping them and you hope you get a deal. Magic Box argues that the best outcomes for early-stage startups don't happen that way. You're never for sale. In fact, you have seduced a buyer. They see the fantasy, they fall in love.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):\nToday, my guest is Jonathan Lowenhar. Jonathan runs a firm called Enjoy The Work, which I've heard amazing things about from so many people over the years. Their firm has a singular mission, to help founders become great CEOs. They do this through a blend of mentoring and advising services, which are rooted in their study of how the best startups operate. They take these lessons and fold them into frameworks and advice and training that they offer their CEOs, their insight, which you'll hear in our conversation, is that most founders don't come into the job knowing how to be a CEO, which includes learning how to do hiring, how to manage financials, figure out growth strategy, road mapping, planning, people management, and so many other skills that nobody teaches a founder.\n\n(00:02:16):\nIn our conversation, Jonathan shares the most common CEO failure modes that he and his team have seen, the Magic Box paradigm for successfully selling your startup, a bunch of advice for finding and hiring the best talent, a framework for building a repeatable go-to-market motion, why and how you should learn to trust your intuition more as a founder and so much more. We could have gone on for so many more hours. Maybe he'll be back to share more advice. If you're a founder or hope to be a founder one day, this episode is for you.

Welcome to the podcast,\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:03:03):\nLenny, I am damn excited.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:05):\nSo am I. The reason I'm excited to have you in this podcast is that you basically spend all your time working with founders, and through that studying, what causes them pain, what causes them to fail, what causes them to struggle, and then you take that and you create frameworks and training and you use that in your work with founders, and I think that's what many, many founders are looking for is how do I avoid pain? How do I avoid these things that I'm going to probably run into? To build on that, briefly, can you just help people understand what it is you do, what it is your organization does with founders, how you work with founders?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:03:38):\nYeah, thank you. I'll tell a bit of origin story that I think ends up answering that question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:43):\nLet's do it.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:03:45):\nI had run a bunch of different types of companies and they were really different ones. I ran a big division for a public company, then I was a private equity CEO, then I did back-to-back startups. The first one didn't get very far, but we sold it, and the second one got really far. When I left the second one, I was like many founders, grossly unhealthy, 25 pounds overweight, wasn't sleeping enough, all the things. I took a few months to get healthy and then reflect on those parts of my career. One of the things that I noticed at the time was all of those companies, when they got to a good place, when they started to run well, they were all run well in the same way. How could this be? How could public company, private equity, startups",

    "content": "the second one, I was like many founders, grossly unhealthy, 25 pounds overweight, wasn't sleeping enough, all the things. I took a few months to get healthy and then reflect on those parts of my career. One of the things that I noticed at the time was all of those companies, when they got to a good place, when they started to run well, they were all run well in the same way. How could this be? How could public company, private equity, startups, early stage, growth stage, when they were run well, they were all run well the same way?\n\n(00:04:35):\nI started to obsess about this question, and what it led me to realize is that every well-run company has a rhythm. It's unmistakable, you can't miss it. You can't not see it. You just spend a couple of days through a spy cam watching a business, you'll see the pattern. How come some startups get there and some don't? How does a founder learn the rhythm? How do they learn how to run a company well? I started to ask investors obsessively, and I asked them, Lenny, I asked them all three questions, same three over and over and over again.\n\n(00:05:14):\nFirst question was, well, describe to me your ideal founder. What's a great founder? The answers universally were the same. Investors would use words that meant grit and tenacity and courage and insight, and I'd say, \"Great. Question number two, describe to me a great startup CEO,\" and they use none of those words. How can that possibly be true? Instead, they describe skills. This is a person who knows how to build stuff and sell stuff and recruit people and raise capital and organize humans and financially plan. Question number three, my final one, well, how does a founder learn those skills while doing the job? I got blank fucking stares, over and over again. It led me down this path that I'm now 10 years into with my colleagues of, well, how do we help founders learn those skills so that their venture investors don't fire them, so that they can actually go build whatever company they want to build and stay in the job for as long as they want to stay in the job? That's origin, that's what got me going.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:27):\nThis episode is brought to you by Pendo, the only all-in-one product experience platform for any type of application.

Hi, Christina.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:07:57):\nYes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:59):\nWhat is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies, like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:08:15):\nYes, so we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:37):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema and not just to build it but also to maintain it forever?\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:08:48):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:08):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust.

I'm kind of tired of talking about founder mode, but it feels like what you're describing is founder mode and manager mode. You basically have to be good at both. This latter part is almost manager mode. Is that a way to think about it?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:09:34):\nYes. Founder mode gets me angry. That article just got me hot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:39):\nDo share.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:09:42):\nIt really felt like an excuse. We were giving founders a permission to not learn the job. If we think about an ascending startup, there's this phase of I have to invent something. I now have to figure out how to get my customer in front of this invention and see if it works, and then I have to build a business model around that to see if there's some repeatable way to attract, win, deploy my customer and thrill them with whatever the solution is. Okay, now I have to go build an enormous amount of demand and then I have to build up an operation that can handle all that demand. Oh, and by the way, at some point, figure out how to turn positive revenues into positive cash flows. The idea that the founder who's writing code by themselves doesn't have to advance their skills to learn how to do all those things, and that in fact what the article even implies is learning how to do those other things is a negative is bananas to me.\n\n(00:10:52):\nThe things required to launch a company are not the same as grow a company as scale a company as exit a company, and the best startup CEOs learn them all along the way. There are lots of ways to learn them. I'm not suggesting there's only one path, but founder mode was almost an excuse not to. I do think what's unique about a founder that felt perhaps where that article was trying to go is that unlike the professional mercenary CEO that gets dropped in, the founder knows everything about what built this company and they can drop in at the most granular level and play anywhere. They can drop into a product feature, they can drop into a customer conversation or a partner conversation or with a long-time employee that's still in IC and be impactful and then rise back up if they've gone the training and get back into a cockpit to run the company again. That's to me the distinction. It's not manager mode is bad, it's the greatest CEOs know when to calibrate which one is needed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):\nI love that. I'm glad we got there. I wasn't planning to talk about founder mode, but I think this is really helpful for folks to hear that are founders and people working for founders too. Along these same lines, you have a really helpful and really funny also mental model for how to think about common failure modes of founders. You have these labels that I love, and this is actually the first thing I heard about Enjoy The Work is these labels that you guys use, and you also, a similar mental model for failure modes for a startup. Can you just share these modes that you've come up with?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:12:31):\nWe do take a bit of a comical approach to some of this. As I've shared with you previously, the name of our company is not an accident. If we can't be playful, we can take the work seriously and not ourselves, so we do fuck around quite a bit. I think if I would separate failure modes for companies versus CEOs for a minute, the company ones are not quite as comedic, but they are ones we see all the time. One is you chose the wrong market. I don't think we need to belabor that one. Lots of your prior guests have talked about the importance of getting that part right or nothing else really matters.\n\n(00:13:05):\nSecond, back to what we were discussing a minute ago, build something people want to buy, got to go build the right thing. Cool. Third one, founder's function. We like to joke that more companies die from suicide than homicide, and it's grim, but also if the two or three people in charge of the business can't get along, nothing else matters. It's all going to break apart. Then fourth, execution, and execution now leads back to CEO. Okay, so now we have a bunch of playful ones here. We have the robot CEO, who believes emotion should not ever exist at a startup, at which point we train them on a very simple formula. Emotions are messy, humans have emotions, startups need humans, therefore startups are messy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):\nI love how engineering-oriented that advice is, which makes sense for robots. Yeah.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:14:03):\nAlso, a little bit more graceful of an answer there is also our CEOs want urgency and passion and excitement from their teams. They want them working enormously hard for below market comp more often than not with this promise of equity that might return value five or 10 or 12 years later. They want them to bring all of that emotion, but they're supposed to figure out how to surgically cut off the emotions that are inconvenient. That's the robot CEO who believes that we can just have",

They want them working enormously hard for below market comp more often than not with this promise of equity that might return value five or 10 or 12 years later. They want them to bring all of that emotion, but they're supposed to figure out how to surgically cut off the emotions that are inconvenient. That's the robot CEO who believes that we can just have several robots working for us and you just press a button and they do a thing. Second one is a pleaser CEO. This is the person who is far more concerned with being liked than running a business, so they can't tell anyone hard news. They can't break ties, they want a consensus on everything, and that's not possible.\n\n(00:14:56):\nIf you have a group of thoughtful people working for you, they're going to fight, they're going to debate and you want them to. Then at some point you have to call it and say, \"No, we're going left not right.\" Or, \"The two of you need to go get in a room and deal with something.\" Or, \"Hey, the way you just showed up is not the way I want you to show up.\" The pleaser CEO won't do any of that. They will simply hide and pray It goes away and it won't go away. Next one is a perfectionist CEO. I'd like to say that these are the CEOs with the most beautiful product to be delivered minutes before they file for bankruptcy. This is the person who is far more concerned with being right and believing that there's always a right answer than just moving forward.\n\n(00:15:36):\nIt creates two problems in a business. One is you're just slow and the other one is you'll never take any bets because you will build a team that realizes the CEO is not allowed to be wrong, so you can't disagree, you can't use intuition, you can't use gut. Everything has to be utterly factual and that is simply not possible. In early-stage startups, you have more questions than you do answers. Everything is circumstantial. It's not like watching CSI entrepreneurship and you get to see a video to say, \"Oh, look, the guy did it.\" No, we have a bunch of little data points you have to come to a conclusion. The next one is the angry CEO.\n\n(00:16:15):\nI had a founder of mine a bunch of years ago and we were seeing a pattern across the leadership team and he and I get on the phone one morning and I said, \"I have a theory for you. It might be a story, I might be wrong, but I want to share.\" He said, \" Okay.\" I said, \"I think you wake up in the morning angry and you don't know it, and then you get to the office and you beat the crap out of the first employee that crosses paths with you over something utterly unrelated because you're angry. You realize that a few hours later and you apologize and your team hasn't quit yet because they believe you're a good human who doesn't have good self-control.\" Then I shared with him, \"And you just had your first child. My guess is because I'm not a psychologist, I'm not a therapist, that you are modeling something that's happened in your life. Is this something you want to change?\"\n\n(00:17:09):\nHis answer is yes, and I said, \"Great. I have good news and bad news. The good news is because you said yes, we can do something about it, and the bad news is I don't know what to fucking do. That's not my job.\" The point being, no one wants to work for the angry person. I don't care what the equity potential is worth, no one wants to work for that person, and the moment they see greener pastures elsewhere, they're leaving. The next one is the one that drives me particularly crazy, it's the laissez-faire CEO, who insanely believes that I can just hire great people and utterly ignore them and let markets take care of themselves and they will do all the right things. I have never met anyone, Lenny, that didn't benefit from good management and the laissez-faire CEO believes that management is not required, and so what they ultimately find is they have really, really good people doing utterly disconnected things and goals are not achieved.\n\n(00:17:59):\nEvery CEO we can reductively reduce to one of two characters. They're either comfortable with the brake or comfortable with the accelerator. The challenge with those who are comfortable with the brake, what I mean by that is they don't want to spend any money, so they're driving this beautiful sports car and they're just leaning on the brake the whole time. Yes, they won't run any money, and yes, they will also get lapped by everyone else and miss the opportunity. Where their opportunity is, is where can you take bets? Where can you actually downshift that car in such a way where you give yourself a chance in the market? Separate, those who ride the accelerator, we've all met this one. They're going to run out of money really fast, and this connects to one of our other challenging CEO types, the ready, fire, aim.\n\n(00:18:49):\nMost CEOs are really bad at planning and that's because there's this little-known secret in the Bay area, most CEOs have never run a business before. Planning doesn't have to be some heavy bureaucratic multi-month exercise that begins in August and ends in February, but a little bit of bottoms up planning to say, what are we trying to achieve? How do we quantify it? What resources are required? What humans are going to do what? How do we shorten feedback loops so we know in a week, in a month and two months, whether we're on the right trajectory? The ready, fire,",

The ready, fire, aim CEO says, \"I don't want to do any of that because they're improvisational and they just want to take bets and they want to take shots,\" and that's what got the company started, and that's also what will have the company go bankrupt. The micromanager one is the opposite of laissez-faire. They believe that no matter how many employees they have, they can do the job better.\n\n(00:19:42):\nThe challenge with this one is it is massively disrespectful to those who work for you. We think that, and this is a bit insulting, that everyone that works for a founder can be fit into one or two chunks. They're either an adult or a child. I have a three-year-old, my little girl is amazing. I'm utterly in love. If she doesn't have a lot of structure and a lot of supervision, she's going to run into things, man. Into things, off things, through things, but adults don't need to be given utter instruction and watched all the time. In fact, it needs to be the opposite. We agree on what success is, what resources are, and you let them go and they'll come back to you when they have questions. The micromanager CEO doesn't see the difference between those two humans. They don't trust anybody and that's actually the thing under the thing under the thing, so they want to do everyone's work and that will succeed right up into the point everyone quits.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:39):\nThis is amazing. Okay, so let me recap these labels that you have just for folks. I have them written down here. There's the robot CEO, perfectionist CEO, pleaser CEO, micromanager, laissez-faire, ready, fire, aim, riding the brake and then riding the gas, and as you said, the ever-popular angry CEO.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:21:03):\nYou got them all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:04):\nAs people hear this, I imagine people self-identify a few of these, like I have some of this, I have some of that, and it's not like black or white. No one is like, \"I'm a 100% robot CEO, and I need to fix that.\" It's like a pie chart kind of, I don't know, what's a visual of this? Everyone's got a little bit of this, basically.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:21:24):\nThat's right. I enjoy giving this talk on stage and watching different founders in the audience cringe at different moments, but it doesn't mean that they're all one or the other. If they were all one of these and then didn't want to even accept the possibility that there's a little bit of a lot of these that they could work on, they're probably not coachable and they're not going to be in the talk anyway.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:45):\nIt's like I imagine each of these is very particular and it's this journey you go on to work on yourself. Let me just ask, what's the most common issue that you've found across these labels of type CEOs? What's the most common one and what do you often recommend someone to work on specifically to help them through that?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:22:02):\nI think ready, fire, aim is the most common that we've seen, and that has been an affliction that's been growing in the last number of years. It wasn't long ago that CEOs could paper over poor execution with easy access to capital. Suddenly, over the last number of years, we're expecting founders to be better operators. Better operators means eventually being on a path when more cash comes into the business and out of the business. That doesn't happen by accident. The ready, fire, aim CEO has probably suffered this pain where they took lots and lots of bets. Maybe they measured the outcome after the fact and they were wrong and they were wrong and they were wrong in ways that were expensive, and they've raised their hand to say, \"I see it. I want to get better at this.\" Basic, basic business design and business planning is not some corporate effort. It's some thoughtful exercise that starts with what are we working backwards from?\n\n(00:23:02):\nBecause in any given time, Lenny, companies are working backwards from one of four things, whether they like it or not. I am working backwards from an exit. I'm working backwards from a next fundraise. I'm working backwards from profitability or I'm working backwards from winding down. We don't talk about the fourth one that much, but I got to choose one. I got to choose the top of the mountain. More often than not, they're choosing a fundraise. Then we'll ask that founder, you know your market, you know your investors, you know the next set of investors, we've done some intel. What has to be true to unlock the next fundraise? That's a qualitative and quantitative answer, but we write it down. We need to get better at go to market. We need to land our first partner. We need to launch next iteration of the product and show this level of efficacy, engagement, what have you. Can we codify that? Yes. Can we talk through what actions would be required on what cadence to unlock that quantified set of results? Yes.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:24:00):\n...",

Do we understand what resources would be required to do those things? Recognize we might have to squint through some of it, but again, the answer is yes. [inaudible 00:24:13] now aimed. If we have a culture that has some accountability, that has a communication architecture, so there's some rituals about how we meet and how we share information and how we talk through problems, and how we work through bottlenecks, well, now we have a plan and now we have accountability. I now no longer have to just guess all the time. And this only works for the CEO who says, \"My improvisational efforts got me here, but I don't think they'll get me there.\"\n\n(00:24:47):\nThere's a guy I worked for a long time ago, and he had this phrase... He had like seven or eight phrases, he would use them over and over and over again. It was hard not to commit them all to memory, and one of them was, \"If you keep doing what you're doing, you keep getting what you're getting.\" And for the ready, fire, aim folks who realize the weakness of that at scale, the way to counteract that, is to start with good planning.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:12):\nIt's interesting that's the most common type of CO, when with Founder Mode, it feels like it just accelerates that further. The whole meme of Founder Mode, which are what makes you upset. Makes sense. Great.\n\n(00:25:26):\nOkay, so I love that you talked about exiting as basically one of these four working backwards paths, because that's where I wanted to go next. I want to talk about some of these specific frameworks and skills and methodologies that you teach, and one of them... I want to almost go to the end of selling your company. And the reason I'm excited to talk about this, is if you think about, and tell me if I'm wrong, but it feels like most startups that succeed end up selling their company. That's the most likely success, right?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:25:58):\nYes, by far.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:01):\nGreat. Yeah, because the other option is IPO or just run this privately forever. Or fail, basically, and fold. So of the successful options, the most common is selling. At the same time, founders have never done this before, they don't know what they're doing. The other side, often, has done it many times, and so it's a pretty treacherous and scary and high-stakes thing to do and to learn on the spot. And you've come up with this methodology that you call the Magic Box Paradigm that I love, that helps founders think about how to lead to a successful exit long term. Can you talk about what this is?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:26:36):\nI can, and I want to give credit where it's due. There's a book by this name, it's called Magic Box Paradigm, written by an independent banker named Ezra Roizen. And the book's fantastic, and Ezra is fantastic.\n\n(00:26:46):\nWhat we've done, is we've operationalized it so that we could teach founders over, and over, and over again. If the founder wants to hire a banker for this particular process, because we're not bankers, we're not BD, we don't get paid that way, we're teachers. But if wanted to hire a banker, go hire Ezra. But the methodology itself is a inversion for how venture and venture boards have thought about startups being ready for sale for a long, long time. It's utterly counter to so much advice that founders have heard. There are two ways you can get acquired. This is purposely reductive. One is you put up a for-sale sign. This is a traditional sales process. You build a list of the companies that might want to acquire you. You figure out the categories of buyers, the companies there, the contact list within that. You ping them and say, \"We're open to a transaction,\" or some euphemism the like. You contact them and say, \"I'll give you some information now. Sign an NDA. Give me an indication of interest by this date.\" And you work through a process, and you pray you have more than one person at the end of the game, try and ratchet them up, sign a term sheet. They will then re-trade along the way, right up until the point you die and you hope you get a deal done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:05):\nSounds very familiar.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:28:08):\nAnd it's one that often will just hit the nervous system of any founder that's been through it a couple of times. Because man, is it a fraught exercise? What Magic Box argues, is that the best outcomes for early-stage startups don't happen that way. You're never for sale. In fact, you have seduced a buyer. You have brought someone in. And there are three stages to Magic Box work. There is learn the fantasy, there's prove the fantasy, and there's quantify the fantasy.\n\n(00:28:43):\nAll right, so what the hell do I mean by a fantasy? You're an early-stage",

You have brought someone in. And there are three stages to Magic Box work. There is learn the fantasy, there's prove the fantasy, and there's quantify the fantasy.\n\n(00:28:43):\nAll right, so what the hell do I mean by a fantasy? You're an early-stage startup, and you meet a company that is in your space, in your vertical, what have you, and they're much more advanced than you. It's a large business. Generally speaking, another oversimplification here, large companies are interested in small companies because they're technology. And small companies are interested in large companies because they're distribution. And there's someone at the large company who becomes fascinated with you.\n\n(00:29:12):\nWhat's the fascination? What they see in their head is, \"Oh, interesting. If I buy your company, this thing happens.\" The classic example of this is Instagram. This is the number one example of this. Lenny, do you remember how much revenue they had when they got acquired by now Meta?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:33):\nI think it was zero.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:29:34):\nI think it was zero.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:35):\nOkay.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:29:36):\nDo you remember the acquisition price?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:37):\nA billion dollars, which was absurd at that point.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:29:41):\nThere was no math Facebook could use, historically speaking, that would justify a billion dollars. It had to be a model on the future. This is Magic Box to a T. They had a fantasy that adding Instagram would expand ad revenue. They figured out some way to prove it. I'll explain more on what I mean by proof. And then their quantification was based on the future. And that's the difference between a Magic Box approach and traditional approaches. Traditional approaches are based on the past, Magic Box is on the future.\n\n(00:30:14):\nLet me tell a story. In one of our companies in construction tech, their technology was able to suck in video camera data from construction sites for project planning. No one was doing this yet. And the business was doing pretty well. We helped the founders launch the company. We got first product in market. We raised a couple of rounds of capital. The product mostly worked. But we weren't sure it was venture scale as we were going along. And we had some large construction tech companies and real estate companies and development companies leaning into us. And one particular company then said, \"Huh, we're really good at construction planning, and we've collected all of this video data that we don't use at all.\" And the champion on the other side in the product org, he has a fantasy. \"Oh, shit. We take your video analytics platform and plug it into what we do, and this is what happens to my business.\"\n\n(00:31:18):\nNow, the person on the other side is a person. And the reason I'm being specific about that, is because you don't sell to a company. Magic Box is about finding the person. You're finding the champion on the other side, the person who has motivated for their own reasons, career, money, reputation, what have you. They see the fantasy. They fall in love. And this person says, \"I am in love with this idea. If I can grab security data into my product organization. Now I have to prove the fantasy.\"\n\n(00:31:53):\nWhat's different about a champion in this kind of process, is they want to find a way to say yes. They're not looking for a way to say no. And this brings us to the four characters you're going to meet along the path of Magic Box. There might be a fifth. You're going to meet your champion, you're going to meet your advocates, you're going to meet your blockers, and you're going to meet your buyer. You might meet Corp Dev along the way.\n\n(00:32:20):\nLet me talk about each of those folks. The champion is the one who's fallen in love. They're the ones with the fantasy. They're the ones who are arguing on your behalf. They're the ones fighting for you when you're not in the room. They are texting you, they're telling you things about the business that they're probably not supposed to tell you.\n\n(00:32:33):\nThe buyer. All they care about is math. It might be a committee, it might be a group, the IC, the EC, the investment group, what have you. They're the ones who actually can sign off on a deal. They care about business case.\n\n(00:32:45):\nAdvocates... Lenny, do you play chess?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:49):\nI have played chess, yes.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:32:50):\nYou have played chess. So advocates are pawns. They don't matter at all until they matter enormously. These are folks that, like, you are the CEO doing a meeting with your potential buyer, and there are somehow 12 people on the Zoom call, but only two do the talking. The other 10 might be advocates. They're rooting for you, but they will take no political risk. Their value is in giving you intel.\n\n(00:33:16):\nBlocker. This is the person who can't say yes, but they can say no. This is OPSEC, this is Procurement, this is Legal. You're going to meet all these characters during the Magic Box dance. Your",

Their value is in giving you intel.\n\n(00:33:16):\nBlocker. This is the person who can't say yes, but they can say no. This is OPSEC, this is Procurement, this is Legal. You're going to meet all these characters during the Magic Box dance. Your champion just wants you to get the deal done so in love. So what happens, is they've come up with a fantasy and you as a CEO need to lean into it. This isn't enterprise selling. I'm not trying to sell you this thing that I have. I'm just trying to find ways to say yes.\n\n(00:33:47):\nSo when, in my story, the person says, \"Could we provide you all of our video data that we've collected forever and you now could enhance our ability to predict whether large- scale construction projects are on time\"? I don't want the CEO saying anything other than, \"We can do that.\"\n\n(00:34:07):\nNow, phase two, I need to prove it. Okay, because I have a champion who wants to say yes, proof can be really easy. And the reason the proof is so important, is not to convince the champion they're in love with the fantasy. They're already convinced. It's because in almost all cases, big company is buying little company and your champion doesn't have unilateral authority. They're going to socialize the deal. They have to get buy-in from who? The aforementioned buyer. They have to be able to survive the aforementioned blockers.\n\n(00:34:43):\nSo eventually, when they pitch this to whatever committee is in charge, that committee is going to say, \"What proof do we have that it works?\" And we just want to be able to provide the champion with enough evidence that it works. So in this case, we said to the champion, \" Well, give us video data, and we will provide you the evidence that you need.\" Because we're dealing with a champion who's not a cynic, because champions aren't, we could tell them, \"And provide us the data in this way, in this fashion, and here's what we'll send you after. Are we in agreement?\" We know we're already going to win the proof, and it's critically important in these dances.\n\n(00:35:27):\nNumber three, quantify. At this point, we're not up for sale, but we're spending a lot of calories on somebody, and they know it. So we have our CEOs say the following phrase to them: \"My board is asking questions. They're wondering why we're spending so many calories on this when it's not really core and we're not selling you our product. I'm convinced of how exciting this could be, together, but I think we need to do some math. So I can explain to my board why this might matter. So let's imagine all this works, because it's going to work, and it's a year from now or five years from now. What changes about your business?\" And the champion will tell you, \"Retention does this, or deal size goes like this, or market share goes like this.\" And you'll say to them, \"Fantastic. Look, I'm going to build some shitty verse version of the model. You tell me what I got right and what I got wrong, but I have a board meeting in 16 days, and I need to be able to walk them through the justify why I am spending so many calories on this exercise.\"\n\n(00:36:34):\nYou build the model, you hand it to them. If they in any way respond to your model, you've won. Because you have now divorced history from future, and you are now playing in future, you are playing the Instagram game in this case. The ending of the story for the company that I was describing, it was a business sub 2 million in revenue. Our prospects of raising series B felt low. We were not yet profitable, and that was an exit that was generational wealth for the co-founders and their families. The CEO went on and spent two-plus years with the now public company that did this acquisition. The technology did get integrated, but it took a long time and they had to do a lot of changes to it, certainly beyond what was envisioned during the diligence process. But all parties are happy. And if we hadn't done it this way and we had just been up for sale, we'd get a dollar for that company.\n\n(00:37:40):\nA couple of other side points that are really important here. For any of you founders out there that are thinking about working backwards from an exit, there are two things that I really want to stress. One is the fantasy is beyond just, \"What is the business change you can have?\" The fantasy is, \"Your books are in order.\" Your fantasy is all of your investors will sign off on the deal and you will have unanimous consent, that the key members of your team are going to stick around, that you're a joy to work with. Please God, founder, do not puncture the fantasy at any time.\n\n(00:38:21):\nSo whatever is starting to shape in your buyer's mind, get to know it. Live that everybody wins from that game. Second, Corp Dev, they will probably show up in the stands. Corp Dev make deals. They're not deal sponsors, they're not a champion, they're not a buyer. They are an expert negotiator. Their job is to facilitate deals and get deals done. The most important things to understand is that they can be a leverage point to have a deal move with some process and some pace and some urgency. Because either deals have momentum or they die, and Corp Dev can help there.\n\n(00:39",

Because either deals have momentum or they die, and Corp Dev can help there.\n\n(00:39:04):\nSecond, they are way better at negotiating than you. So anytime dealing with a superior negotiator, the only thing you can do to try and even the scales, is move the negotiation async. So founders, repeat after me, I'm talking to you directly now. You'll say to Corp Dev, \"You know I'm not alone in this decision. I love what you just said and I'm excited about this opportunity. Once I see it in writing, I can socialize it with advisors, lawyers, co-founders, whoever.\" But don't negotiate live. You will lose.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:39):\nLet me just say that was extremely delightful to listen to. I've never heard like a M&A strategy be this fun. And it makes me want to sell a company. It's like, \"Okay, let's do this. I'm hyped.\" I think you got it all. I have a few questions.\n\n(00:39:56):\nInterestingly, the middle part is... It feels a lot like enterprise sales, which a lot of founders are used to. Understand the stakeholders move things forward. Here's your champion, here's your blockers, here's the buyer. Is there anything there you want to say, what's maybe most different from enterprise sales, which I think a lot of founders are maybe used to? Or is it pretty similar?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:40:14):\nYeah, I think three things. One is there are a lot of moments in enterprise sales where we're trying to push for a compelling event. That doesn't work in seduction. The playful metaphor that we'll often use, is you've been dating for a while, this person could be the person, but they're not quite convinced yet that it should be a life together, and you're sitting at dinner. And in enterprise sales, you're eager to get it done. You're eager to move the relationship forward and move in and get engaged, what have you. And so you might be inclined to say, \"Hey, either we move this relationship the next step, or there are a whole bunch of people eyeing me, and I'm going to go date someone else.\"\n\n(00:41:06):\nThat conversation never goes well, and in Magic Box founders are eager to do the same thing, thinking that competition will improve their deal size, when in fact I think more often than not, that is a negative signal until the very end of the dance. So instead in enterprise selling where I'm pushing, in Magic Box, I'm always trying to entice, I'm never, ever trying to push. So instead I might say things like, \"Hey, I'm going to raise my next round in Q1, because I've been intending to do this business independently. Now all I really want to do, is win. I just want my product in as many customers' hands as possible. Whether I do that on my own as I was planning, in partnership with someone, or under someone else's roof, honestly I don't care. But I have a company to run and I'm going to go raise my next round in Q1. And if I do that, probably too expensive for this deal to make sense anymore, and my board will want me to move on anyway.\" I'm enticing. I'm never trying to push.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:15):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

Now you can assess risk, secure the trust of your customers and automate compliance for SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA and more, with a single platform, Vanta.\n\n(00:42:36):\nVanta's market-leading trust management platform helps you continuously monitor compliance alongside reporting and tracking risk.

Any advice you could share for a founder that's like, \"We probably need to sell this company\"? What can they do to start creating these relationships, find this person, create this fantasy in their minds?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:43:28):\nEzra does this really well in the book. Again, it has to be not solicitous. So one of our companies, we had maybe 20 months of capital left, and the two co-founders and our team were convinced, \"This isn't a venture business. We thought it might be a venture business. It's not a venture business. It takes too long to do a deal that's not that interesting with each of our enterprise customers.\" It was disappointing, but at least we were honest about it. \"Okay, so who are we going to sell to? Let's go play this game.\"\n\n(00:44:04):\nSo we started with categories, categories of buyers. It could be, for this particular example that was in my head, ERP companies could be a buyer, large banks could be a buyer, the big software companies like Microsoft could be a buyer",

It could be, for this particular example that was in my head, ERP companies could be a buyer, large banks could be a buyer, the big software companies like Microsoft could be a buyer. There were a few different categories. And we said, \"Great. Who are the companies within those categories that make sense?\" They're acquisitive, they have the balance sheet for it. There's a Corp Dev department, so we know that they actually know what they're talking about here. Ideally, there's an existing relationship with core team or advisors or board members. Make a list.\n\n(00:44:45):\nNow, how do we meet them in a way without selling them? So one of the examples in the book, which I love, is small startup wants to meet the luminaries in a space, and they have their PR agency set up a panel where they contact the CEOs of the potential buyers and say, \"We're putting together a panel of the world's foremost experts in X. We're going to put four people on the panel, and it's going to be you and famous person number two and famous person number three, and this fourth person,\" that is a luminary to us. And it's our startup CEO. And suddenly you're at the table as a peer. It's a completely different conversation.\n\n(00:45:32):\nThe second one, and this is going to sound a little silly, but I am not exaggerating, it works. If you are a CEO founder and you have that title on LinkedIn, it's amazing the responses you'll get. So we made this list and we just started to send connection requests to the CEOs or CPOs or CFOs on our target list, and said something as simple as this, \"You're doing something really cool. So are we. You game just for a 30-minute chat? Because I don't know where it'll go, but I think it'll be fun.\" Keep it that informal. It's peer to peer. I'm not selling you anything.\n\n(00:46:10):\nIf you can draw a line to some post that they had or some speech that they gave, even better. But we found without fail, there would be math that would show up, one out of four, one out of five, or one out of six, \"Yeah, that sounds fun.\" There's a lot of those CEOs never talk to startups, and that's fascinating to them, especially when presented with the energy of, \"I just want to have a fun, intellectual discussion.\"\n\n(00:46:37):\nWhat you're looking for in that first conversation, and this is what we ask our CEOs to do, is to ask questions like, \"What do you care most about in the next year? What's the mandate? What about for your department? What are the things that keep you up at night? What's the break? What's the thing that could actually kill everything, if you had a pre-mortem for the next year?\" Those kind of open-ended questions, because what we want our CEO listening for, is the fantasy to see if there's some intersection between what they care about and what we might be able to squint and say we do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:07):\nIt's interesting, because it sounds a lot like there's a jobs-to-be-done framework here, or just like, \"What is the job they need done?\" What is the pain you're going to solve, and then create a fantasy around how amazing it'll be for them if you can solve that problem.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:47:19):\nAnd ideally they'll say it and you just reflect it back in active listening.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:25):\nChris Voss negotiation style. Okay, so you're the kind of guest, Jonathan, where the whole podcast could be about each one of these topics, and so I know there's so much more to talk about here. I want to move to a different topic, but to leave folks with, one is if they want to explore this methodology more, there's a book you mentioned, called Magic Box Paradigm by Ezra Roizen, right?\n\n(00:47:51):\nIf companies are in this process, starting to think about it, does it make sense for them to come to you and like, \"Hey, help me through this process\"? I know you said, \"Go to an investment banker.\" Or does it make sense to like, \"Hey, let's bring on Jonathan,\" or someone from your team to help them?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:00):\nIt makes sense to like, Hey, let's bring on Jonathan or someone from your team to help them.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:48:03):\nWe meet two types of founders. Founder one says, fix this part of my business, totally transactional. I want to raise the next round, or I'm hiring people badly or my founders aren't getting along, or I want to sell my company. Well, I need to be honest, that's not interesting to us. That's not our work. Go find someone who is, and I don't mean this disparagingly, but like a screwdriver, like fixes one thing, go fix one thing. Then we meet second type of founder and that founder says, most likely to themselves, 'cause it's the only safe audience. There's some gap between the CEO I am and the one my company needs me to be. There are a set of skills that I'm great at and there are these things where I know if I'm really honest with myself, if I listen to the quiet voice, I'm",

That's the one we work with. And it's when they care that much about both the hard skill development and maybe the soft skill development in their path to become a great CEO.\n\n(00:49:10):\nHow to sell the company. It's one of the skills. We teach this to all of our founders as well as hiring and management and planning. I don't care what the thing is. For every one of our founders, we audit them and say, here's what you're great at, here's what you're shitty at, and here's what you've never done before, and which of these do you want to work on next given where the company is in its cycle.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:29):\nGreat segue to where I wanted to go with this, which is hiring. So I hear all the time that a founder's core job is fundraising and hiring an amazing team. Basically that's their main goal. Just like hire amazing people. The people you hire make your company, create the culture. You got to get that right. But similar to trying to sell your company, most founders have never really hired lots of people, they've never hired for all these different skill sets they're trying to hire for and I know that you guys spend a lot of time helping founders hire and find amazing people. Can you just share some of the advice you share with founders for how to find and hire amazing people?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:50:06):\nYeah, so we actually think the CEO has three jobs. We agree with the two that you said, but we think there's a third. One is, make sure everyone knows where we're going. The second one, pick the right people for the team. Third one, give those people the tools they need to win. And you can abstract from those what they all mean, but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:27):\nI love that.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:50:28):\n... most founders are really bad at hiring. They fall prey to all sorts of pretty common human biases. The lazy ones, back to laissez-faire, think it's just gambling like, oh cool, they worked at Meta and Salesforce already, so hire them, just gambling. There was work done by and then codified in a beautiful book. I'm going to make sure I get the names right, Geoffrey Smart and Randy Street. They had a consulting firm that dates back to the mid-nineties. Then they wrote a book in 2007 or 2008 called Who: The A Method for Hiring. We have operationalized that book and then expanded on it 'cause there are some parts of it that we found a little dated, but it's really still as applicable today as it ever was.\n\n(00:51:18):\nAnd I think there are three core mistakes that founders make all the time, that can be really easily rectified. The first one is, you should hire people who have already done the thing you need to have done next. And I know that sounds simple, but founders don't think of hiring that way. They start with a job description. We've been taught that for a long time. Start with the job description. It's a fucking mistake. Start with, it's 12 months later, you hired the person, they started today, 12 months have gone by, you're clinking champagne because of how great it's been. What's changed about the business? What does success look like 12 months later? Document it. And then when you interview people, look for people that have already done that stuff.\n\n(00:52:13):\nSecond, the notion of does the person in front of you have a history of creating raving fans? They talk in the book about this idea of you being pulled or pushed in your career. If you were an outstanding performer in Job A, it is a high likelihood that in job B, someone associated with you in job A is going to pull you into the next thing and then pull you into the next thing and pull you into the next thing and you'll never do a job search 'cause you were great. And if you see a history of that, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, really attractive candidate. Third, core values matter a lot. Culture is not an accident. Culture at scale is the codification of what matters to a business and the ritualization of living those values. It starts with whoever the founders are and then it will emanate across as long as the founders are super consistent. But that also means you need a methodology for evaluating the next human in front of you on whether they actually represent your values. We think of these interview stages in a way similar to the book, we use slightly different language, but we think that there is a culture interview, there is a functional interview, and there is a technical interview, but they're designed to get at these notions of have they actually done this kind of work before? Have they been pulled or pushed in their career and are they your kind of human?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:00):\nFunny on that last detail actually, [inaudible 00:54:03] at Airbnb, there was actually a core values interview team that was",

Have they been pulled or pushed in their career and are they your kind of human?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:00):\nFunny on that last detail actually, [inaudible 00:54:03] at Airbnb, there was actually a core values interview team that was formed around studying what the founders Brian, and Joe, and Nate valued specifically and then they codified them to core values at the business and then there's this team that was a very select handpicked team that at every interview loop interviewed the person for their values.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:54:22):\nThat is a beautiful example of how interviewing for values is independent of title. 'Cause you'll find people in the company at every stage of a company that are the best ambassadors, the best embodiments of those values. Please use them for interviewing and in addition, they love it 'cause they're protecting their castle. They love where they work, they want to keep it that way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:45):\nSo true that team is a real special team and it was really honored to be on that team. So let me summarize what you just shared, which I love. There's so much value here, it just keeps going and going. So when you're hiring, your advice is: look for people, one, that have done it before; two, that have been pulled from job to job by someone else that loves their work and wants them to be with them at this new company. And then three, their values match the values of the founder and the business essentially, right?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:55:11):\nYes. And for the recruiters out there, a really simple way to get rid of a lot of the crap that ends up showing up at the top of the funnel is just to ask the simple question even in the cover letter, of your last ex-bosses, how many would get on the phone and say, you're amazing? If there's any equivocation in the answer, great, move on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:35):\nSo a couple of follow-up questions here. One is, this point of hiring people that have done it, obviously this implies don't hire junior up-and-comers as much. Thoughts on just when it makes sense to hire someone more junior that's really ambitious, real smart, you think they can learn the job, thoughts there?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:55:53):\nSo one of our companies is hiring a team of reasonably junior account execs. We're looking for folks that have been out of school for two years. Now, that means they are highly unlikely to have had three years of quota achievements and a similar... you get the point. Okay, so how do you hire someone who's already done it? We know what success looks like 12 months later. For that role, they've learned how to hunt, they've been able to create pipeline of X and close Y in business, et cetera. What we are looking for then in their history, if they have any sales chops of any kind. They could be selling Girl Scout cookies, or tickets to some event, or they work for a non-profit for while. I don't care, but I want some evidence that they've sold. I want some evidence that they're comfortable getting on the phone or showing up at meetings or showing up at events. So, that they've done it before should be reviewed or thought of creatively.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:07):\nGot it.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:57:07):\nNow for more senior roles, I want an explicit. We think of, for example, for executives, Lenny, we think there are three types of executives that startups end up hiring over time. We call them the architect, the optimizer, and the scaler. The architect, let's use sales as an example. This is someone who has to build a playbook. So they're going to uncomfortably stay close to the founder, watch and listen, and listen to recordings and pick their brain to pull the magic from the founder of like, oh, here's the dance that she or he goes through to actually close a deal and they write first playbook. And the goal of the codification of that is so you can bring on a first account exec and the next account exec because account execs back to our language earlier in this adult children dynamic are children. You need to give them structure for them to win. That's the architect. The optimizer, this is someone who's now going from a few account execs to maybe 10, 15 and we now have targets we have to hit. The business is now reaching a different level of professionalism and expectation and you have to optimize that earlier playbook to try and find more efficiency and performance out of it.\n\n(00:58:21):\nThe scaler is saying, okay, now how do I find leverage? How do I have 10X more account execs or how to get other people to sell for me? They're all going to be called VP of sales or chief revenue officer. They're completely different archetypes, and that same person exists in engineering and in product, et cetera. In those cases, I only would want to bring on an architect if they'd been an architect before. If they'd only been an optimizer, they're going to fail because they've never written playbook from scratch.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:50):\nIt touches on a conversation I had recently. It was a live podcast recording with Shreyas Doshi at my summit where he talks about a lot of people are really frustrated at work because they're in the",

It was a live podcast recording with Shreyas Doshi at my summit where he talks about a lot of people are really frustrated at work because they're in the wrong one of those buckets, essentially. Like you enjoy certain type of work and your job is not doing that type of work, whether it's in your case scaling or optimizing. And so, it just reminds that if you're frustrated at work, you're in the wrong job in terms of the type of output they're trying to expect from you.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (00:59:18):\nThe story in my head is that talking to me and my colleagues sometimes can feel a little like death by frameworks. We have one for everything and in this example, I think if you're going to be sustainably successful in any kind of job, I don't care what it is, three things have to be true. You have to be good at it, you have to like it, and the market has to give a shit about it. And if one of those is off, you're not staying in that job long.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:40):\nYeah. And this touches on the name of your firm, Enjoy The Work, got to enjoy the work to make it sustainable. Okay, one other thing. So one other follow up question real quick on the hiring and then I want to talk about one other bucket of work. And again, I think each of these could be like an hour, two hour long podcast conversation. I love that there's this recurring theme of working backwards to inform what you do today. So earlier you talked about working backwards from what the outcome you want next for your business, whether it's fundraising or exit or winding down. And for hiring, you have the similar advice, work backwards from what you want this person to achieve in the first year, whether it's drive this sort of growth in the product or drive sales. I guess anything else there of just the power of working backwards versus the typical approach for hiring, you talked about job descriptions.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:00:26):\nHiring is never the goal and it's often the first thing that we'll hear from a founder, \"I have to hire this person.\" One, that is so dangerous for confirmation bias. The hiring manager is always the one most burdened by that particular bias, but it's also hiring is never the goal. We will pull them back to over and over and over again, which of the three milestones matter, right? Fundraise, exit, profitability. What has to change about the business, for example, to get to that fundraise? How do we quantify that change? Some sort of goal setting framework. OKRs, EOs, I don't care. All goal setting frameworks have the same bones. There's some description of it, there's some quantification of it, there's some work that has to be done. There's some accountability rituals with clear owners and clear agreements.\n\n(01:01:18):\nSo once I actually have the quantification of here's what work needs to be done, I now know what resources I need to be able to pull that work forward and therefore now I know what kind of humans I need, whether I'm hiring or renting. And that should drive the conversation, not the, \"Oh God, I need another PM.\" It's no, here's the set of features that we've said matter most this year. Here's the gap in the resources we have and the resources we need, that's why we're hiring this role. And here's what success would look like 12 months from now or six months from now. So they're tying back to what would change about the business.\n\n(01:01:57):\nAnd this is this recurring theme of our work with our founders. They're so in it Lenny that they rarely have time to sit above what they're working on. This notion of working in the business versus on the business. And so much of our work is to separate them from the day-to-day, which is enormously important, not in any way denigrating it, and I need to know where I'm headed and why, and how I'm going to measure progress along the way. And so, so much of what we're doing with them is to say, I want to hear from you what you think success looks like. I'm going to push back and pressure test a bunch of things. Can we define that in a way? Can we agree on who needs to do the work along the way, and how we're going to keep checking on it to keep feedback loop short? Now we can go back into business and then we'll check again in a week or in a month.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:54):\nI love that. That's actually a great segue to the final bucket I want to spend some time on which is growth and go to market. Another area that many founders have never worked on before. A lot of founders are like, Hey, I have this awesome idea. I'm going to build this awesome product. I know how to do that. I know what market needs. But building a go-to-market motion to get it into people's hands is a whole different skill. We spent a lot of time on this on the podcast, you have a really cool simple framework of just how to think about go-to-market. There's all this like, oh, you need a go-to-market strategy. Talk about how you talk to founders about thinking about what it takes to put together a go-to-market plan and how to make it a repeatable motion versus just I'm just going to go to people and try to sell",

So we do try and distill it to something that is in bite-sized chunks. We think of it in four pieces. The first piece is ideal customer profile. Who do we really want to sell to? What are their qualifications? What are the discovery questions we would use to get to those qualifications? What are the kill criteria to know that this is [inaudible 01:04:10] fool's goal, this really isn't the human?\n\n(01:04:13):\nSecond bucket, loosely called marketing. But within that marketing is also positioning. So what is our uncommon denominator from the enemies? So who are we competing against? Is it actual companies or is it status quo in some sort? What are they great at? What are we great at? What are we great at that they're not? Then how do we represent that in the world? That's branding and artifacts and identity work, et cetera.\n\n(01:04:44):\nNext is demand gen, which we'll simplify to say, how do we go find the humans we want? I've long loved the book Traction that Gabriel Weinberg... I'm going to forget unfortunately the co-author's name right now, Jason Mares? Sorry. Where they talk about the 19 channels that all companies have availability to, they're the same ones. Now the book has got a couple of years on it, so there are a couple of new channels that have popped out since, but what we then try and expand the aperture for our founders is rather than just think about meeting your next customer through however you did at your last company, availability bias, instead, which of these might make most sense next? A simple two by two matrix can work here like some experimentation, some brain writing. Love brain writing, not brainstorming. I know you've talked about that on prior pods. And then high impact, low effort. Can we think of the three or four experiments we want to run by channel? Let's go play.\n\n(01:05:48):\nAnd then fourth, sales. And this is the codification of a playbook. How are we having the conversation? How are we doing discovery? How are we handling objections? How are we doing demo? How are we moving to close? If we can get through those four, then we can start to talk about deployment and customer success and upselling and account management, et cetera, et cetera. Those are good problems to have. Oh my god, my install base is so large, I need to manage it. Great, great fricking problem. But we try and break this complexity of going from individually selling to building a machine into just these four buckets. Who am I selling to? What do we want to say about ourselves? How do we reach them? How do we close them?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:28):\nAmazing. I was going to summarize that. You did an excellent job there. Before we follow up on this, you mentioned this term brain writing. What does that mean?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:06:35):\nOh, first time I heard of this was Adam Grant. I don't know if he's the originator of the idea. Brainstorming, you talked about this a bit in your Annie Duke podcast as well of how horribly coercive meetings can be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:55):\nFor brainstorming, especially.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:06:56):\nFor brainstorming especially. And so, what many of our founders don't recognize because they just see like, Hey, I'm just sitting around a table with a group of folks I respect, so we can just debate things as peers. No, you can't. You're a founder. Your voice has a megaphone attached to it even if you can't hear it. So you have to turn down the megaphone if you actually want to learn what your people have to say. So brain writing is I'm going to expose an idea and I want everyone to now write and weigh in on there... it could be in a survey, it could be in a shared doc, what have you, my preferences in through some sort of methodology, you are now sharing your opinions, comments, edits, dreams, in an async way that no one else can see until it's all combined, maybe even ideally without authorship identified.\n\n(01:07:50):\nThen when the founders weigh in, you don't know, they're just a part of the mass. Let everyone read the thing. I even like the Amazon, take the first 10 minutes of a meeting, let's just go read so we're all fully present and then have a debate. What it allows for is the dampening of the founder effect in meetings.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):\nYou're just so full of golden nuggets. That's just like a random tangent that I think could be really transformative for a lot of teams. So the advice here is just when you're trying to ideate and brainstorm, don't go in a big room and put post- its on a wall and talk throughout ideas and have a discussion. Instead, just everyone individually sits and thinks and shares their thoughts and the founder presents, here's a problem,",

That's exactly how I operate. I need to think and process. I'm not on the spot quick thinker person. So 100% fan of this approach. Let me come back to your go-to-market framework. I have the notes pulled up here. So basically if you're a founder or even a product builder and you're trying to think about how do I... people keep telling me I need a go to market plan, I need to grow this thing. How do I think about this? You're basically saying there's these four buckets to think about; who are you selling to? How are you going to motivate them and get them excited to buy your thing? How do you reach them? And then how do you close them?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:09:37):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:39):\nLuckily I have podcasts and newsletter posts on every single one of these buckets, if folks want to pursue each one of these. I have templates for ICPs, marketing advice, all these things. So that's good news. There's a lot of content for people to read if they want to explore this stuff. Let me ask you, where do you often find the biggest bang for your buck when you come to a founder or if founder comes to you and they're like, I need to figure out, go-to-market motions? Just start from the top and work your way down. Or is there, here's where maybe you want to spend a lot of time.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:10:10):\nEarly stage founders, and this is certainly more true for the first timers Lenny than the veterans 'cause they learn this problem. The first timers are like twenty-something year olds in a bar and they're being social for the first time in their lives, and anyone that makes eye contact with them is enough for them to say, I want to go on a date with you. That's it. There's no discrimination of any kind, like, oh my god, they like me, I'm in. That's the mistake that hounds first timers. The veterans and those we get our hands on. Instead, we say, let's imagine you could build your perfect customer in a lab, like a Petri dish and you grew them, what do they look like? And if you have any kind of install base, I'll ask the question. I just did this with the founder the other day. They are enterprise whale hunting business. They have four large customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:13):\nWait, actually whale... okay, whale hunting in terms of large wealth person or actual whales?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:11:21):\nThe extreme of enterprise selling.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:23):\nOkay, okay, got it. I want to see a whale hunting startup. Okay, go on.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:11:29):\nI said, so which of your four customers is your favorite? Which one, if I got them on the phone, they would rave about you. They would be salivating openly with a chance to evangelize what you're doing for them. And they was like, oh, that's clear. It's this one of the four. Great. Tell me about them. And what you start to see and pull apart from that is the founder does have an ideal profile. They do have a dream. Now, there are all sorts of risks about is the world too small? Is it not a big enough market if they get too tight, and founders get so caught up in that and it's a mistake because all we're-\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:12:00):\n... so caught up in that, and it's a mistake. Because all we're looking for in the beginning is a white-hot center of opportunity, a small population that is an enormous fan that's getting enormous impact. We can worry about adjacencies and expansion later. I like to remind them that Amazon just sold books. We can start with one thing and be great at it. So where the founders often get hung up on for us is that they've moved towards selling without contemplating ideal customer profile, without contemplating qualifications, without contemplating discovery questions that get to that. And most importantly, kill criteria, if this is true do not sign them, even if they want to go out on a date with you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:48):\nI'm glad you said that because that's exactly what I believe and I hear often on this podcast is how underappreciated picking your customers in early leads are. And if you think about this funnel you described, figure out who you're selling to, how do you motivate them, find them and then sell them, all this trickles down from who are you going after. You will know how to motivate them if you know who you're talking to versus the opposite. If you're talking to everyone-\n\nJonathan Lowen",

Is there anything else on go-to-market or growth you think might be helpful just to touch on before we close up our conversation?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:13:25):\nThe one thing I'll share, this goes back to the ready, fire, aim that we talked about earlier, is that there's implicitly a funnel, mathematical funnel, to what we just described. And founders often make the mistake when planning for the year ahead of I need to be at this revenue to justify this multiple. And then all of the funnel math is a plug, and that's death, as opposed to here's what's been true for the last three months, six months, nine months, 12 months. And then what assumptions can I reasonably make with ways I'm going to influence that funnel going forward, to go build up to where I think I'll be a year from now? And it just lowers the bias that your planning process operates with.\n\n(01:14:15):\nBut when a founder starts from a place of, \"I have to get to 3 million or we're dead,\" you're already dead. As opposed to what do I really believe I can do to get there, changing top of the funnel, changing conversion rates along the way, changing a deal size or deal length, et cetera based on my recent history, and then have a conversation about the gap between where I think the business reasonably can get with some ambition, and where I think I need to be financially, because that's the more mature conversation and that's the one the ready, fire, aim CEO doesn't have. That's the one most founders have only started to learn to have over the last few years when capital dried up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:57):\nI love that. I love just how practical and real talk your advice always ends up being. Speaking of that, I emailed a founder that you work with and asked him, \"What should I ask? What should I ask Jonathan when he comes on the podcast?\"\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:14:57):\nUh-oh.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:09):\nAnd he said something that was really... That's great. It was really unexpected what he said. He said that the biggest lesson he learned from you is to, as a founder, to trust his intuition more throughout the journey of his startup. Can you just talk about that as something you've learned, something you've seen, that maybe founders under appreciate?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:15:31):\nIt's impossible not to be a startup CEO and not face many existential moments. Is my company going to survive? Did I make a mistake? Will I ever be hired again? Should I sell the company now? Should I break up with a co-founder? Should I fire this critical employee? They happen to all of us. And fear is not a good decision maker. Our lizard brain is a really bad decision maker in those moments.\n\n(01:16:07):\nAnd so what we'll often share with the founder who's facing one of these scenarios, and I know the CEO you're describing and he's facing one of these scenarios, we'll say to them, \"Do you know that little voice when you get really still, the quiet one that says you should marry this person, you should take this job, you should start this company? Watch out for that human, they're a bad one.\" And most of the time, Lenny, when I frame it that way the person across me says, \"Yeah, I know that voice.\" And I'll ask, \"How do you hear it?\" And they're usually some version of, \"I have to get really alone, really still, really quiet, walk on the beach, listen to music, work out, play with my pet.\"\n\n(01:17:06):\nI said that voice is who you are. It's not your brain. Your brain is a tool. It's our hands, it's our feet, just a tool. It's a pattern recognition machine. But who you are, if you can watch your brain, you know what you're thinking, like, oh, look what my brain's doing. That means you're not your brain. It's something else. And that's the little voice, and that little voice is going to be right. And where we get screwed up in life is when we stop listening to that voice, when the mania of our chaos of our lives get in the way of that voice.\n\n(01:17:42):\nAnd so whenever our founders face one of those moments, it's not a framework, it's not a playbook, or even a directed piece of advice from us to say, \"You should just go left. I've seen this before. Go left.\" Nope. I trust founder intuition. If the founder says this business is still going to work, or this co-founder is the wrong person, or yes, it's time to sell, I'm in. We're just here to support them. And we try and be the only person in their life that is fully on their team because we're not on the preferred side of the CAFS table. We're not fiduciary, we're not board members, not a co-founder, none of those things. And so in those moments we'll just say, \"Can you get really quiet",

We're not fiduciary, we're not board members, not a co-founder, none of those things. And so in those moments we'll just say, \"Can you get really quiet?\"\n\n(01:18:21):\nAnd the founder you're talking about, I have the story in my head, he was facing a breakup moment with his co-founder, and I asked him, because he's good at getting quiet, \"What did the voice say to you way back when?\" And the voice said to him, \"This is the wrong fit. This isn't going to work. He believes in different things than I do, and that's going to go badly.\" But the lizard brain didn't want to believe that, and so it took another year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:58):\nWow. I had tingles throughout that entire piece of advice. I love how it's also very applicable to just life, not even just being a founder. It's a good reminder to trust that voice more. It's interesting that this also connects to founder-mode a little bit, and I'm curious how you think about that where a lot of the founder-mode advice is like trust your judgment, don't hire people to delegate things away. Do you see a difference in the core idea of founder-mode and just like, but you should actually trust your intuition more?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:19:35):\nIntuition comes from, in my point of view, a deep understanding of self, and the capacity to get quiet and be well resourced, meaning you've slept well and you've eaten well and you have enough love in your world. And I think what founder-mode can confuse is my intuition says I should just do this job for them and fire these three people. That's not intuition, that's reaction, that's a fear response. And when the founder says, \"I sat with this, I felt it out, I can see it. I need to terminate my whole go-to-market team and start over. This isn't working, and I have data that supports it, but I know this isn't working.\" I'm like, \"Let's go with that. I'm in. Let's do it.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:36):\nAnd I think you described a lot of times people feel this, and it takes a year, two years, three years, many years to actually realize that. And your advice here is try to listen to that more and trust it more. Yeah. Wow. Okay. Well, Jonathan to pivot our energy, is there anything else want to leave listeners with, last piece of advice, anything that you think might be helpful before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:21:04):\nTo be a founder is a state of being. It's an attitude, it's courage, it's instinct, it's a capacity to push through, despite all sorts of evidence suggesting you're wasting your time. To be a CEO is a craft. The more founders who can accept that those are two separate things and they're both equally important to build an ascendant startup, the better all of us will be. And so what I would encourage every founder out there that wants to go build something substantial, go work on your craft in addition to working on the business. Be honest with yourself about here's the shit I'm bad at. I don't know how to read a financial statement. My board meetings suck. Half my meetings that I have with my leadership team we all walk out of there saying what did we just accomplish right now? Or I get to the end of my workday and I'm like, I didn't get anything done. Those are all examples of just not taking the craft seriously enough. I'll leave with that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:18):\nI love that. And I think I've made the mistake during our conversation of confusing founder and CEO and assuming they're the same thing, and I really appreciate you just again pointing out to folks that that's the big distinction you got to start making is there's the founder and there's the CEO. Often they're same person, but different parts of your brain and different skill sets.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:22:36):\nAnd I'm now fully off the very awkward soapbox I've been sitting on for a long time, so we can go to lightning round whenever you're ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:44):\nWith that, we've reached our very exciting lighting round. Jonathan, are you ready?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:22:48):\nI'm ready. I'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:49):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:22:54):\nMy number one business book that I've recommended would be Five Dysfunctions of a Team, by Patrick Lencioni. I do think it always comes back to team. The right team can solve all the things. And that book is a beautiful distillation of the most common problematic archetypes that show up in a leadership group. So that's the number one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:16):\nAmazing. Anything else you'd recommend?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:23:19):\nThe second one, it goes more personal. It's a book called Untethered Soul, by Michael Singer. It was, at least for me, the first introduction to this idea that I am not my brain and that my brain can be a tool that serves me well, and at times doesn't. So that would be number two",

So that would be number two.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:38):\nI've started to read that book and then I never finished it, so this is a good reminder to give it another shot. Second question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:23:50):\nI just watched and really enjoyed, because by the way, I have a three-year-old at home, so the amount of content I now consume is reduced tremendously. Well, my wife and I just watched Will & Harper. This is the documentary between Will Ferrell and his very dear friend who just recently transitioned. They road trip across the country together, and it was freaking delightful. It was sweet and endearing and one of the better things I've watched in a while.\n\n(01:24:19):\nTV show, Slow Horses, I'm utterly addicted. I'm only midway through season two, but I've been voraciously sleeping less and watching more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:31):\nI love both those. I just watched Will & Harper, and completely agree with your sentiment about it. I wasn't planning to watch it. My mother-in-Law started watching. I'm like, wow, this is really fun. It's also funny, meaningful funny.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:24:43):\nThere's so many moments in it that are really sweet. As an aside, this was '20, I don't know, April 2020, and a group of our very close friends said, \"Hey, how are we going to keep in touch?\" And so we started what we called Movie Club, and we routinely either pick a TV show or a movie. We all watch separately and every two weeks we get together on Zoom at night, we talk about what we just watched.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:06):\nI love that.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:25:07):\nAnd some have been great, some have been terrible. But Will & Harper was our most recent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:10):\nOh, such a cool tradition. Okay, we'll keep going. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be something physical?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:25:21):\nTwo, and one is I'm going to talk my own book, but I still love it. The first one is Aura Frames. These are digital picture frames. They're amazing. The UX for them is incredible, the quality of it, they're pieces of artwork. So grandparents, in-laws, parents, we have multiple in our house, just love it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:46):\nJust to clarify, it's a frame that has picked digital photos and you can give it to your mom and show photos of your kid wherever they live. Is that right?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:25:55):\nAnd the combination of the ease of the software and the quality of the imagery is better than anything I've tried, and I've tried a bunch of them. A-U-R-A Frames, and this is not an Enjoy The Work company. This is just one I'm a giant fan of.\n\n(01:26:08):\nThe second one is an Enjoy The Work company called Augie Studio. A-U-G-I-E Studio. This is Canva for video. It can turn anyone with no engineering skills whatsoever, no code video creation, with full editing tools. So suddenly you can create branded high fidelity, high quality commercial video in minutes, with no effort. It's amazing. It was built by two media tech co-founders that were building this thing pre-ChatGPT, and it's just growing like this, and it's super fun, and the guys are great. So A-U-G-I-E Studio.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:51):\nSounds amazing. Augie Studio, I could use that. That sounds awesome. Two more questions. I feel like this one's going to be a good one. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful and work on in life?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:27:04):\nThe first one, and the one that I probably most commonly refer to, is that there is only one life. The quick backstory, and I know it's a lightning round, but I'm guilty of these stories. I went for a walk with a girlfriend of mine a bunch of years ago. And we did this once a month and we would always have a pretty typical ritual of giving each other life updates to begin the walk. And so I started the conversation with, \"So there's the family update and then there's my work life and then there's my social life.\" She's like, \"No, no, no, no, no, stop. That's all bullshit. It's one life. Stop assuming that there are these pretend walls between them or among them.\" I've lived that ever since.\n\n(01:27:42):\nSo I try and show up. That phrase lets me show up the same way, no matter my setting. If you and I were having a beer or a meal, or if I'm sitting with one of my co-founders or clients, it doesn't matter, I show up the same way everywhere. Part of the way I enjoy the work is by",

Part of the way I enjoy the work is by having a real friendship, a real intimacy with everyone at Enjoy The Work, and including our clients as well, I want that level of conversation. I don't want the sterile stuff over here with my work environment versus my personal versus my family. It's just one version of me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:15):\nAnd the phrase is, it's just one life.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:28:17):\nJust one life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:18):\nIt's just one life. Final question. So you ran a casino at one point, I believe, and it was like a Harrah's Casino, is that right?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:28:28):\nMy first career was in the casino business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:30):\nOkay.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:28:31):\nBut before I go on, what's the question?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:32):\nThe question is just is there a fun story, or experience, or lesson from that time in your life that might be fun to share? Maybe a mob involvement, or cheating, or something? I imagine that's a unique life experience.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:28:48):\nI'll tell one of my favorite family stories then briefly. But yes, my family goes back in casino gambling in one form or another, several generations. My great-grandmother ran a illicit poker game. My grandfather ran numbers out of a gas station. My father's been in the casino industry since Atlantic City in the 70s. My sister is a prominent gaming attorney, and I worked in the industry for a dozen years, so this is my family. And Lenny, I didn't know any of this was weird until I was in my mid 20s.\n\n(01:29:18):\nI turned 21, and I'm old, yes, I'm going to just hide the year. I'm kidding. Anyway, I turned 21 and we take a family trip to Las Vegas because that was normal for us. My father was doing a lot of work out there, so he got us hotel rooms, etc. I'd never been there before, and I was newly 21 and so my parents said, \"You have $300 to gamble with. We're going to be here for five days.\" This is a vacation. My grandparents are coming in. My uncle and aunt were coming in, and they're encouraging me, \"This is all up to you, but try not to lose it all on night number one,\" which was good advice to give me. I was 21 and I was pretty much a schmuck at the time. But also, part of my experience being there was to interview for a summer internship. I was a college going to be junior.\n\n(01:30:06):\nSo we go and I immediately go sit at some table and start playing some games. And I turn $300 into a few thousand dollars in the very first evening. And that was exciting and it was crazy and it was wild, et cetera. On the third night, which happens to everyone who goes to Vegas for too long, we're all delirious because all of us are staying up all night and being silly and being stupid. And my parents ask me, by the way, this is pre-cell phones, they ask me, \"Hey, can you stay awake? Your uncle and aunt are going to arrive late tonight. They'll call the room. You can come down and just greet them and say hello?\" Sure. So I get the phone call like 11: 30 at night. Go on downstairs, they're here. I go downstairs in the casino floor. We're staying at the Las Vegas Hilton. It's since been renamed, but I go downstairs and I can't find them anywhere. I think, okay, well I have cash in my pocket and I'm now awake so I might as well gamble.\n\n(01:30:53):\nShortly thereafter, Lenny, I have an experience that happens one in 369,000 occurrences, and I win $35,421.92. For the trip I ended up winning $40,000 that I turned $300 to, and I was just 21 years old, which has left me with one of my mantras that I've had for the rest of my life, which some people roll their eyes at, but that is gambling does pay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:20):\nI love that you remember the exact amount. What games did you end up playing that helped you win so much money?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:31:27):\nThe primary game that I played was Caribbean Stud Poker, where there's no skill of any kind. You get five cards, the dealer gets five cards, whoever wins wins, and if you have particularly unusual hands you get odds on the hand. And I got dealt 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 of spades in five cards.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:44):\nI thought you'd say slots or something. I love that you're just sitting there playing poker and went from $300 to $40,000.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:31:51):\nIt's not even real poker.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:",

I'm glad I went there. Jonathan, this was incredible. I think we've helped a lot of founders through this conversation. Two final questions. Where can folks find you guys? Who would be a good fit? What should people know about Enjoy the Work? And finally, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:32:10):\nLove that. So let me unpack those three. The first one is enjoythework.com, or just find me on LinkedIn. I'm not hard to find. Send us a note.\n\n(01:32:22):\nWho should ping us is very simple. If you're a founder out there, or a CEO out there, and you know in your heart that there's some gap between how you're running the business and how the company's going, and how it could be going, and how you could be running the business, if there's some gap there, we're here to help. Now our expertise, as we talked about in this call, is company building. So if you just have an idea on a napkin or you have a science experiment that you're not sure, we're useless, that's not us. But if you have some breadcrumbs worth following, like the business is starting to work, you're a series A into B and beyond, and you know that there's better, you can see it, that's where we help. Send us a note. Love to chat.\n\n(01:33:06):\nHow can listeners be useful to us? So we are ferocious readers. All we try and do is study how do the best startups do X? From tiny things, like how do they run all hands meetings or off sites to the big meta topics of what is going to repeatable go-to-market even mean? Or what is financial planning in a way that's useful? Or how do you set goals that won't make you roll your eyes? We consistently learn from the ecosystem of podcasters and authors and journalists, like, go look at this material. So if your listeners have a favorite X on whatever topic in running a startup, send them my way. All we love to do is read and chew on that stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:54):\nAwesome. And the best way to send that is either through Enjoy the Work or LinkedIn.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:33:58):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:59):\nAwesome. Jonathan, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJonathan Lowenhar (01:34:02):\nLenny, this was so damn fun. Thanks for listening to my crazy casino stories.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:07):\nI want to hear more, but we got to go. Bye everyone.\n\n(01:34:11):\nThank you so much for listening.

At this point, we're 100 people large, the pace here is insane.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):\nYou said that you've had to throw out most of your growth playbook.\n\nElena Verna (00:00:14):\nI feel like only 30 to 40% of what I've learned in the last 15 to 20 years of being in growth transfers here because we just need to invest in such bigger bets, and innovate, and create new growth loops here, everybody and their mother is starting a vibe coding business nowadays, and we need to figure out how to be ahead of them. And to be ahead of them is not optimization of the problem, it's reinvention of the solution. I just feel like I usually spend maybe 5% innovating on growth in my previous roles, right now, I'm spending 95% innovating on growth, and only 5% on optimization.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):\nWhat do you find is actually moving the needle?\n\nElena Verna (00:00:50):\nOne of our biggest strategy is building in public, and it's coupled with employee socials, founder-led socials. And another one is giving your product away a lot, this is part of our growth secret sauce. You have to remove the barrier of entry. If somebody, one of our users stands up and say, hey, I'm going to have a hackathon at my work on Lovable, can you give us some free credits to play with? Why would we prevent a person who wants to do all of the marketing and activating for us from using us? We're like, take it, how much do you need?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:22):\nThe trick is get more people to try it, just ship things you can talk about.\n\nElena Verna (00:01:25):\nThe only way to create a word of mouth loop is just to blow their socks off.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:31):\nToday, my guest is Elena Verna, head of growth at Lovable. In under one year after launching, with fewer than 100 people, Lovable hit 200 million ARR, which is one of, if not the fastest ramp to 200 million ARR in history, and growth is still accelerating. They've also recently raised a series B at a $6 billion valuation. So, with that, there's a lot to learn about what Lovable has figured out about growth. This is Elena's fourth visit to the podcast, a record, she is my favorite growth mind, and in our conversation, we talk about how the growth playbook has fundamentally changed for AI companies. What works now, what no longer works, and what has surprised her most about how Lovable grows.\n\n(00:02:13):\nShe also shares her advice about whether working at an AI company is right for you, some incredibly interesting insights into Lovable's secret sauce for growth, the unique ways they operate internally, their approach to building minimal, Lovable products, also how they hire, and also how product market fit as a concept is no longer what it used to be, and how every company basically has to recapture product market fit every three months. This episode is incredibly tactical, and you will leave this conversation smarter on so many levels.

Elena, thank you so much for being here and welcome back to the podcast.\n\nElena Verna (00:05:24):\nThank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:26):\nAs you know, this is a record fourth time back to the podcast, no one else has ever achieved this feat. I feel like you're basically my co-host now.\n\nElena Verna (00:05:36):\nI love it. Thank you for inviting me back, I'm very proud record holder in this regard.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:41):\nWhat I love about you coming back each time, it feels like every time you come back, you're just doing something even more epic and exciting. And so, these days, as we'll hear in the intro, you're head of growth at Lovable, which no big deal on track to be the fastest or one of the fastest growing companies in history, depending on the metric that you track. Let's talk about just the scale and growth of Lovable to give people a sense of just how incredible this is. I'll share a bit of this in intro, but just what are some stats you can share about just how things are going Lovable?\n\nElena Verna (00:06:08):\nSo, we are just a little bit over one year's old since we launched. The company actually did exist as a GPT engineer before, but it officially launched in the third week of November last year, in 2024. So, for us, we've hit over $200 million in annual recurring revenue before we even hit our one-year milestone since being launched. Which is pretty incredible. You, Lenny, actually have a really great blog post on how quickly it takes for companies usually to get to their first million ARR, and it's usually multiple years. So, this is definitely a unicorn, I don't think this is a standard. There's a couple of things that account for it, and we can talk about it, and the growth is only accelerating, so it's compounding, which is great. Because we had our 100 million in end of July, and just four months later we were at 200 million.\n\n(00:07:02):\nSo, seven months to, well, maybe eight months, to 100 million, another four months to get to 200 million. And from users too, we already have over eight million users that have tried Lovable, we have, as you can imagine, to feed that 200 million, hundreds of thousands of paid subscribers as well that are paying for us, so things are going great and we'll talk about why.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:27):\nOkay. Absurd. I think people are getting used to these insane numbers, and not long ago is like, okay, if you hit a million ARR in a year, you're doing pretty well.\n\nElena Verna (00:07:36):\nYeah, yeah. I think still you're doing pretty well if you have a million ARR in one year. This is one of the once in a lifetime type of companies, and the category, the way that it's evolving. So, I want to make sure that people don't all of a sudden set this as a benchmark for success because it should never be. In some categories, it might be even faster as we continue evolving technology, but I don't think that it's realistic to expect it out of your business that you're starting right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:08):\nThat is such an important point you're making there, it's so discouraging to founders to hear these stories of getting 200 million. And again, this is ARR. There's a lot of companies, especially in the data labeling space, I've had them all on the podcast, that are very fast-growing, but they're not recurring revenue. There's also, they pay out their people to do this data labeling. So, the revenue numbers there don't really equate. Recurring $200 million a year is absurd.\n\nElena Verna (00:08:36):\nYeah, it is absurd. I really want to make sure that people understand as we go through this episode as to why it's happening, because part of it is on Lovable, part of it is just in the market and how it's moving. So, when you're setting yourself as a benchmark, so you know which benchmarks you actually to use, and whether Lovable is the benchmark that you should be using.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:56):\nCool. I'm going to get into that next. Last question, just I want to see what you can share here. A lot of people look at these numbers, a lot of people are very skeptical these are lasting, durable numbers.",

I'm going to get into that next. Last question, just I want to see what you can share here. A lot of people look at these numbers, a lot of people are very skeptical these are lasting, durable numbers. Like who are these people? How is there $200 million being spent on Lovable? Anything you can add about, just give people confidence, is this real, this is going to last, this is a really durable business.\n\nElena Verna (00:09:19):\nWell, I saw Stripe receipts, so it is real, as far as I'm concerned, unless Stripe dashboard is lying to us. But it is money getting deposited in our bank account. But let's talk about who is actually contributing to that number. We do have a really large use case of people starting their own companies on Lovable, so we call it a founder use case. Where somebody that is non-technical, that has never been able to code or create a piece of software is now able to come in and actually build an app completely from scratch. And some of them are already monetizing it, some of it just using it [inaudible 00:09:52] for other services, or some physical goods, for example, that they're selling. Some of them are just still building. And we monetize on the act of building, so that progression of building up to your product market fit takes quite a bit of time.\n\n(00:10:06):\nAnd even with Lovable, we're so much more efficient and effective compared to hiring an engineer in terms of the price, but it still takes time. So, we have a lot of founders, whether it's B2C, whether there's B2B, so consumer products, business products, e-commerce, whatever it is. But on the other side, we have a lot of employees within companies using Lovable as well, where they're building internal tools, or they're building prototypes, they're building landing pages. So, that is another use case that is very relevant and quite efficient for us, but then there is a hype and discovery that is happening as well. Because when I think about software, I think about it, I talked to John Cutler actually, and he gave me this framework that is completely stuck in my mind, of software always goes through capabilities stage first, so what is possible to actually create with this?\n\n(00:11:00):\nThen, it needs to transition into value, of how is it that am I going to get value out of this? And then you can start thinking about scaling it, of which aspects of my life and my work that can actually go in? And we're right now very much in the capability stage with vibe coding, because everybody's just exploring, what can I do? And the beautiful thing here is that what you can do changes every month to three months. So, you constantly need to come back and you need to see what has changed. So, a lot of people use it for personal reasons. I build myself apps, tutoring apps for my kid, so he has to answer questions in order to get some screen time accumulated for him. I build my own portfolio.\n\n(00:11:40):\nI see people doing wonderful things, my favorite story that I always say, there's this man that created a proposal on Lovable. So, his fiance had to answer questions and she had to complete this game, and then at the end there was this big reveal and he proposed to her. But people just unlock the most creative things that they build on Lovable, and that's where the revenue is coming from. The one piece that is working very well for us in terms of how our monetization model is, set up and how it interjects with your activation moment, which we can also cover, but that is what's driving both conversion and retention rates.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:17):\nLet me ask you one question that's on people's minds, I imagine, as you talk about this, just what does retention look like?\n\nElena Verna (00:12:22):\nYeah. So, retention, really, I look at it in two ways, retention, that it comes as a subscriber retention. So, how much [inaudible 00:12:32] subscribers do we get, and how many of them are we capable of renewing? There's also very important aspect of it is, how many of them can we expand? Because if you can get positive or above 100% net dollar retention, which is super important metric for investors... If you don't know about net dollar retention, please read it up, that's like a superpower to get bigger multiple if you can show NDR that is over 100. And then there's actually engagement retention as well, because that is the leading indicator for how your paid retention is going to look like. For paid retention, I know there is so much on the market of, oh, this is a high product, and it's a leaky bucket, and it has really high churn rates.\n\n(00:13:10):\nAlthough, I shouldn't share, it's not public numbers for us to share actual retention, however, what I can say, it's on par with benchmarks of other B2B SaaS products that I've ever worked at. And I worked with Miro, Dropbox, SurveyMonkey, Netlify, Amplitude, and others. So, are we absolutely crushing with paid retention? No. Are we where most of the other companies are? Yes. Our NDR is quite good because when people build, they want to buy more credits to",

Our NDR is quite good because when people build, they want to buy more credits to build. So, we're seeing really good revenue retention, but we're honestly more focused right now on engagement retention than even paid retention because our North Star is just to get as much usage as possible, and we will fix and tune our monetization model afterwards. So, engagement retention, I would say, is a by far bigger priority focus for us at the moment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:04):\nThat is incredibly interesting, and I'm optimistic to hear because of the growth rate. Rarely is growth rate this high and retention is on par with great companies.\n\nElena Verna (00:14:15):\nYeah. And I'll just say too, which is a little bit maybe counterintuitive would be to a lot of companies, we don't optimize for revenue at all. In fact, internally, we have a lot of discussions about how can we give more products away, how can we reduce our revenue growth rate by just getting more paid subscribers, more users using Lovable, to just get bigger share of the market. So, our revenue is an outcome of us just trying to get more people through the door, not us trying to optimize for revenue per user, or to get them to monetize at the higher rate. So, there's a very interesting path here, where, by actually focusing on the inputs, like you should, it translates to a good output, but we don't look at that output as something that we're trying to grow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:02):\nLet's talk about growth, let's talk about what you've learned about growth in this space. You had this post online where you said that you've had to throw out most of your growth playbook. This is a huge deal, you've led growth a lot of really successful companies. Lovable is growing incredibly well, this tells me there's a lot we can learn from what you've seen. So, tell us what you're seeing, what's still working, what's not working, what you've learned about what it takes to drive growth at a company like Lovable.\n\nElena Verna (00:15:28):\nYeah. I would say that in any other role that I've come into before, I felt confident in about 80% of the patterns that I can bring to that role, meaning that I can identify inputs, understand which framework applies. I know a lot of examples that fit in within that framework, so we just need to localize a solution and push, and it was quite productive in terms of getting a company those additional acquisition, conversion, engagement, monetization rates. So, I felt very repetitive in a way, after some time, because I feel like I'm just coming in and copy, pasting, copy, pasting... And although every single company loves to say that they have unique problems, at the end of the day, all of the problems were very similar. And I felt like I was doing the same job over and over again. When I started at Lovable, the one thing to me that was very clear is that this company was growing like crazy before I joined.\n\n(00:16:21):\nSo, I want to make sure that there's not that much value on what I have even added today, because this company is on the tear, and yes, we're rounding the edges and removing barriers for growth, so we're not standing in our own way, but there's something more magical happening here that is not a pattern that I've ever seen before. It's not a framework that I can even conceptualize in my head. And plus, it's a new category that I've never seen, or I've never been in a company that is in a new emerging category, that hits fast moving water so quickly. And that's the difference because when you're usually trying to create a new category, it takes years. I know it's every marketer's dream to create a new category, but it takes decades often to really get that much hype and adoption around it. Versus with vibe coating, this hype seemed to have happened really quickly.\n\n(00:17:16):\nIt's like it's hit the nerve with the market. So, yes, we're at the right place, we're at the right time, but we're also in really fast moving waters, and the demand that is coming to us, we need to capture it mostly, we don't need to generate a lot of it yet. But at the same time, it comes with the really big downfalls of we're not in control of a lot of our growth. Let's be honest about it, there's so much incredible word of mouth that is happening, and we're trying to grow that, but to enable as much of that as possible, but the company is moving, we're just hanging on to it as fast as possible, and making sure that we're not going to hit a wall, so to speak, in front of us, and that the wheels are greased, and that all of the pieces are in places. It's like your race car framework that you have as well.\n\n(00:18:05):\nWe're really just putting a lot of oil into it, and figuring out what is our engine actually going to be that is going to take us forward. But when I'm thinking about the patterns here, and what I have to unlearn, I feel like only 30 to 40% of what I've learned in the last 15 to 20 years of being in growth transfers here. And some of",

It's like your race car framework that you have as well.\n\n(00:18:05):\nWe're really just putting a lot of oil into it, and figuring out what is our engine actually going to be that is going to take us forward. But when I'm thinking about the patterns here, and what I have to unlearn, I feel like only 30 to 40% of what I've learned in the last 15 to 20 years of being in growth transfers here. And some of it is very straightforward, okay, this is how you're going to do paid marketing, this is how you're going to do some of the habitual retention, here's the free to pay maybe monetization frameworks that still stand. But the rest of it, honestly, it doesn't feel like it even matters anymore, because we just need to invest in such bigger bets, and innovate, and create new growth loops here, as opposed to trying to optimize it to the moon and beyond, which I usually be focused on in a scaled business like this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:57):\nLet's follow those threads. So, what is it that no longer is worth it in this bucket of just like, let's not spend any time on this thing, and then what do you find is actually moving the needle?\n\nElena Verna (00:19:06):\nNot worth it, in growth, most of the people spend most of the time optimizing existing user journeys. So, you already have maybe some of your growth loops that you understand that you try to optimize or you just know, hey, there's big drop-offs from acquisition to activation, let me go figure out how to... I can tweak the dials to get it done. Here, what I find is that optimizations are just not worth our time. So, a lot of the times my growth team actually ends up working on new features, or just standing up new growth loops one after another, and yes, there's of course the saying of more growth loops does not mean more growth, but at the same time, the market is moving so quickly, you need to stand up a bunch of initiatives to capture it because it's perishable.\n\n(00:19:54):\nOr we also have so much competition. We're not alone here, so we can't ignore that there's everybody in their mother is starting a vibe coding business nowadays, and we need to figure out how to be ahead of them. And to be ahead of them is not optimization of the problem, it's reinvention of the solution. So, I just feel like I usually spend maybe 5%, maybe 10% if I'm lucky, innovating on growth in my roles, in my previous roles, right now, I'm spending 95% innovating on growth, and only 5% on optimization. And most of my frameworks are on optimization because it's really hard to come up with frameworks for innovation because by default there, by definition, they're innovative.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:38):\nWhat I'm hearing here is new features. Launching new features, [inaudible 00:20:42] product is one of the bigger growth levers, versus you have a bunch of cool stuff, make it easier to use, increase activation, reduce friction, things like that.\n\nElena Verna (00:20:51):\nYeah. And for example, we on growth team launched integration with Shopify, to enable e-commerce use case, because we're like, hey, there's already people trying to come in and do it, Shopify was open for integration with us, let's go lean into it so people can vibe code their storefronts. That came out of growth, that usually would never come out of growth. Why would growth team ever invest into a core product integration? Or we enabled voice mode for people so they can actually chat with Lovable using their voice, as opposed to only having type. And that's also, it's a feature, it's a core product feature, but we're like, hey, it's going to help people to converse with Lovable more, it's going to increase the engagement.\n\n(00:21:32):\nOne area that we've spent very little time in is activation, because usually I spend majority of my time in activation because there's so many awareness things that need to happen, and so many things that we need to smooth out experience for the users in order for them to get through that setup moment, to aha moment, to the habit loop, and here you're just interacting with agent. So, we, at the beginning, we're like, the agent team that we have here is working a lot on it. Why would we go in there and do anything? It's like our core team is responsible for activation. Now, we're starting to move into doing agent work ourselves, so all of a sudden growth team is not just doing product surfaces, now we're doing agentic workflows and codifying agent instructions in order for customers to activate better.\n\n(00:22:21):\nSo, the work fundamentally, I feel like has gotten deeper into product, and deeper into actual core product functionality, as opposed to just being a smoothing surface on the outer layers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:35):\nOkay, that is also a very big deal, every growth person that's ever been on this podcast, including you, always talks about the power of activation, just how much opportunity there is to get people to this aha moment, realize the value of this product, that increases retention and increases everything. And what you're saying here is you barely spend any time on activation because in a company like Lovable, there's a prompt, you give it what you want, it generates a thing, and that's basically all it is. And so, the impact is to make that agent better...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:00):\n... basically all it is. And so the",

And so, the impact is to make that agent better...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:00):\n... basically all it is. And so the impact is to make that agent better at that thing, versus micro-optimize every step.\n\nElena Verna (00:23:07):\nAnd our agent team spends night and day thinking about it. So I've never been at a company where core team thinks so much about activation, thinks so much about that first generation, thinks so much about reaching a-ha moment. So it's more weaved in into DNA of the overall company, which takes the pressure off of me to only have to focus on it. Because otherwise, yeah, I would be in that experience all the time.\n\n(00:23:32):\nBut I feel a lot more at ease, because everybody's thinking about it and everybody's working on making agents better. And agent, the beauty of it is it doesn't matter if it's actually first generation or if it's your Nth generation. It just needs to be a better generation. Agent needs to understand your intent better, and think and reason behind it. So it improves the entire lifecycle immediately as opposed to having to only work on that first experience per se.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:59):\nAnd what you're not saying is, \"Don't care about that experience,\" it's, \"The team building that is already obsessed with making that activation experience better and better.\"\n\nElena Verna (00:24:07):\nExactly, exactly. I love that, because that's the core product functionality at this point. And before people would spend more time building deeper features, or deeper use cases, or trying to improve some platform functionality. And now the core team, they're obsessed about that first experience because that is core product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:29):\nAnother lever that I've noticed, especially with Lovable, and I'm seeing it more and more on social media is just founders telling you what's going on. I think this connects really deeply with the new features. Launch new features. Say Anton is just like, \"Hey, check out this cool new thing. Check out our growth numbers.\" Is that a big growth lever too?\n\nElena Verna (00:24:47):\nYeah. So one of our biggest strategy is building in public. Building in public, and it's coupled with employee socials, founder-led socials for sure. This is difficult for larger companies. But when you're smaller and you still have a little bit more narrative control with everybody on your team, plus you have so much more trust within the organization, where people are going to say the right things because they understand what actually has happened, that ability to just really quickly deliver the message to the market becomes really important.\n\n(00:25:21):\nNow, we still do the big launches, so we still have everything tiered into tier three, two, one. Tier ones are going to happen as big moments that we're going to really rally as a company behind. And it's going to be something that is meant to step function, change our product market fit, and we're going to do a bunch of activities behind it.\n\n(00:25:40):\nBut at the same time, what's really important to us is to maintain noise in the market. And that noise in the market happens by us shipping every day, every other day, multiple times per day and just talking about it constantly. Interestingly enough, it's actually works fantastic resurrection strategy, because people are like, \"Oh, there's more things here. I need to go check it out.\"\n\n(00:26:03):\nIt also works as a great reengagement strategy. So instead of sending newsletters to say, \"Here's the market trends or here's the user stories,\" people are literally logging into their social to say, \"Okay, what has Lovable shipped now?\" It's like, \"What is the change?\" So it's interesting to them to see, because from the time that they voice their opinion on what needs to happen to actual delivery is so short, so they feel heard. And they are heard, because that's how we prioritize all of the things that we're shipping. But it's interesting, because I've never been in a company that tries to maintain so much just shipping velocity to maintain a certain amount of noise that it feels like the product is alive. It's changing every single week. And then there's these big amplifications, turbo boost so to speak, in the race car model, that then go out and they fundamentally create a step function change in that product market fit as a whole. And that is a retention strategy I can get behind any day and all day. I only hope that we can maintain it as we continue scaling.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:07):\nSounds stressful. This reminds me, I had a... Gaurav, he's the CEO of Mirage. Used to be called Captions, which is a really successful AI video company startup. And they have a policy of you ship a marketable feature every week. That's how their company operates. And it's the same thing, it's just ship things you can talk about.\n\nElena Verna (00:27:27):\nVelocity of shipping is our number one core value in development team. So we do anything and everything to just keep it going up, up, up and into the right. And by the way, this also means that everybody has a little bit of marketer within them. We have very lean product organization. We actually lean on our engineers to do a lot of",

We have very lean product organization. We actually lean on our engineers to do a lot of product work. We call them product engineers, and they have to go and they have to announce the thing that they've shipped. It doesn't just funnel through marketing.\n\n(00:27:57):\nSo there is a lot of autonomy, a lot of agency that needs to happen with this type of velocity. Because otherwise, you have to have enormous marketing team to staff that. So it has to come with some roles and responsibilities. Redefinition on the team as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:13):\nLet's talk about marketing. That's something else you've written about is just marketing is changing in a big way, their role in growth. How does marketing play a role in all of this?\n\nElena Verna (00:28:21):\nOn one side, marketing channels are changing. On the other side, marketing's involvement into everything that product does is changing. And then number three, I think even marketing organizations in terms of where they hire the most are changing as a result as well. So I'll talk about second one first, just because we just talked about shipping, and that is... Yeah, you still have your product marketers, you still have your channel managers. But they focus more on the big things and the narratives.\n\n(00:28:49):\nAlthough it's difficult, because the narrative even changes all the time. As these functionalities come through, usually you can come up with a positioning and messaging, and you can have it for years and create all of the campaigns around it. Now, you have it for three months, and then the product changes. So the cycles here are really, really short. And for smaller changes, because cycles are so short, they spend so much time actually focusing on it as they should.\n\n(00:29:15):\nBut some of these smaller changes just cannot be supported by marketing. You have to delegate it to your product and engineering team to do their own marketing, because otherwise, again, you'd have to have an enormous marketing team in order to support it all.\n\n(00:29:27):\nBut at the same time, channels in which marketing right now works I think are changing quite a bit. And not enough people I feel like are freaking out and talking about it, as opposed to moving just in the same direction over and over again. And the changes that I'm seeing is that it has been very clear to me that when you're talking about marketing organic strategy, if you asked me that five years ago, I would've said that's SEO. It's search engine optimization. Go on Google, that's your organic marketing strategy.\n\n(00:29:58):\nIf you ask me what's your organic marketing strategy right now, to me it's all about social. Which is what is my CEO posting? What is my team posting? What is my creator economy doing? Influencer marketing, and across all of the social platforms. That is my organic, which is... That one's paid, to be fair. But when I think about organic, there is still a lot of that word of mouth. What are my users posting on social? What are they talking about it? What are they sharing?\n\n(00:30:26):\nWhich is a mind shift, because I've been always... Especially in B2B, so focused on search. And now I feel like it's been completely pushed even further into consumerization territory, and it has become all about social no matter how B2B you are, because that's where eyeballs are at.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:44):\nThat is fascinating. And so when you talk about socials, what are you finding is most helpful? Is it Twitter/X? Is it LinkedIn? Is it YouTube, TikTok, Instagram?\n\nElena Verna (00:30:52):\nFor founder socials, our employee socials, X and LinkedIn are fantastic sources. Especially for B2B, because that's where all of the BBWB people are at. But you cannot just have ChatGPT write your copy and post it, you need to show personality. There needs to be humanity that it goes through it. And it's not natural for everybody, and it feels very awkward sometimes to start. But it's important to people to see who is building the company, because there's so much competition now on functionality, so they can rally behind a team.\n\n(00:31:28):\nSo they want to have a team that they want to win. And for that, you need to be vulnerable, you need to be authentic, obviously, but you just need to be yourself. That corporate scrubbing has to completely fall off, which is obviously going to pull in as the company scales. But at least at the beginning, that is your chance to stand out.\n\n(00:31:52):\nAnd then your customers posting about you. So that word of mouth of really creating a product that creates something for customers that is worth talking about. It gives them stories that they want to share, that feels empowering to them to tell to others like they're unlocking a secret. They feel proud of what they have created.\n\n(00:32:14):\nWhich what we focus a lot on, Lovable on, to have that feeling of, \"Oh my gosh, I have superpowers now and I can't wait to tell others. I cannot wait to show others what is happening.\" So on both of those sides, to me, that is",

I cannot wait to show others what is happening.\" So on both of those sides, to me, that is very much organic. If you aren't a consumer, then Instagram, TikTok are very much a go as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:35):\nThe CEO clearly is an important variable in this, them. In this case, Anton just tweeting, \"Here's what's going on Lovable. Here's how fast it's growing. He's something we've learned.\"\n\nElena Verna (00:32:44):\nIt is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:44):\nWe had the CEO of Gamma on recently, granted, and he's exactly the same thing. Just sharing a bunch of lessons, journey building in public, a big part of the growth lever. And your point here is okay, so it's the CEO. But then it's also how do you get your customers to share things on socials? And then there's a paid influencer component.\n\nElena Verna (00:33:01):\nYes, the customer is difficult one. That's a word of mouth loop that you need to stand up. The only way to create a word of mouth loop is just to blow their socks off when they actually experience your product. We have a almost unfair advantage, because our product is called Lovable. So by default, we're trying to create absolute lovable experiences. That is a mentality internally. If it's not lovable, we're not going to ship it. And the best way to fix a bug at Lovable is to say, \"This is not lovable,\" and everybody just jumps on it to fix it right there and then. Sprints, no sprints, it doesn't matter, it's getting fixed right now.\n\n(00:33:40):\nSo from that perspective, we have that culture already embedded as part of our brand and it's part of our name which helps us a lot. But the point is that you feel that brand through every interaction. I talk to my designer all the time, how can we add more love marks into the product? How can we prioritize more unique interactions? The little elements that make up that feeling of this product is speaking to me. It's like, \"It feels something that is unique.\" It has personality behind it.\n\n(00:34:08):\nSo we put all of the brand work actually into our product. When you think about Lovable, people think about a brand, but we don't have a brand marketing team yet. So it's all just through product interactions, and some of those building and public moments of the people behind those product interactions that is our strategy.\n\n(00:34:28):\nAnd then there's influencer marketing. Interestingly enough, influencer marketing is 10 times bigger for us than paid social. So yeah, we do some paid social as well, and it's working decently. It's quite expensive from payback period, we're still optimizing it. As I said, we're pretty early on in all of these channels. But influencer marketing is something that has worked from the beginning at Lovable. And a reason behind it is that influencer marketing, especially on the socials, it gives you an opportunity to have a little video and interaction. And Lovable is all about seeing like, \"Oh my gosh, this is what I can do, and this is possible.\" So that drives people to go and try it themselves.\n\n(00:35:07):\nSo that's why social works very well for us, because it's not really a written value proposition. Nobody knows what vibe coding is. But you watch 10 seconds of it and you go, \"Whew, that's new. Let me go give it a try.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:18):\nWho would've thought that a head of growth, who is traditionally seen as data, metrics, spreadsheets, drive KPIs is like, \"Okay, how do we make this more lovable? How do we add more moments of delight?\"\n\nElena Verna (00:35:31):\nI know. My joke is at the end of my Lovable journey whenever... Hopefully it never comes to an end. But at the end I'll be a growth brand person. Hi, my name is Elena, I do brand now. But I actually see it as part of growth strategy to make sure that that brand shines through every single interaction. And I always talk to my team about it, because that is one big lever in our growth story.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:58):\nYeah, so I think that's a really important point to highlight. The reason Lovable is growing so fast is it is a product people love. You've made something people want. And the word of mouth spreads, because it's something that blows people's socks off as you said. So it feels like that's the first thing you got to get right.\n\nElena Verna (00:36:13):\nYes. Well, the first thing you have to get right is you have to be at the right place at the right time and you have to be in fast moving waters. Let's not discount how fast this category is exploding on its own. So this cannot happen in every single category that you're starting to build a product. But the way to stand out in the super crowded category is to create experiences that speak to people.\n\n(00:36:33):\nThat I think is something that a lot of people deprioritize, because they still prioritize functionality over humanity within software. And I think that we're actually moving to the new era",

And I think that we're actually moving to the new era of software that needs to feel human, that people want to interact with, not just utility of it. Because cost of software is coming down so much to develop that we now can actually invest into emotional feel of that software, as opposed to only just focus on creating the utility out of it.\n\n(00:37:04):\nSo to me, it's a... I love this move, because I hate nothing more than going to software that is just so painful to use that I lose some brain cells as I'm interacting with it, versus software that I feel I get energy out of. And for Lovable for me, I cannot wait on some of the projects that I have to go and vibe code myself. That's the highlight of my day. I bring in my daughter and I'm like, \"Let's go do this.\" Like, \"What do you think that needs to be done?\" Because I just get so much energy out of doing it. And that is the feeling you cannot create by looking at it as a utility problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:42):\nThe way I think about it, the way what you're describing is it's almost table stakes have increased, and now it's so easy to build. Now the big differentiator is experience, design, delight.\n\nElena Verna (00:37:52):\nExactly, and it has to translate through every single interaction. So your designer has to be one of your first hires now in startups. It's not just about the engineering, so to speak, utility. And you have to think through every single interaction of, does this communicate our brand or not?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:09):\nSo along those lines, I want to come back to something you talked about, which is launching new features as a huge growth lever. The big question there is just how do you maintain quality and cohesiveness as all these people are empowered to ship stuff? Is there anything else there you've seen that works well to help avoid just the Frankenstein product that's endless features that you want to tweet about?\n\nElena Verna (00:38:28):\nYeah. One part of it is not something that you can codify, but it's the type of people that you hire that are going to go and ship these things. We at Lovable try to hire the absolute best talent available out there that we can bring in, and that we can source and that we can attract to grow with. And what do I mean by that best talent? It's not that somebody who has been at really large companies, or somebody that has really done a lot of logos or has big success stories behind them. It's somebody who is extremely passionate about their job.\n\n(00:38:59):\nIt's their hobby. They love to work. They have fire in their belly. This is not a paycheck for them, they want to do this for some ulterior reason. This is the biggest opportunity of their life, so this is global maximum against any other opportunities that are in front of them at the moment. So that's very important for us.\n\n(00:39:18):\nWe want people to come and do their absolute best work at Lovable. It's very important, and you can feel it in this office. People are wired up. They are so high on how can we make this better? How can we deliver more to our customers? And that's very different compared to usually how companies grow where like, \"Okay, yeah, the check, check, check. They fit the skillset, let's bring them in.\" But is that passion, is that fire behind it?\n\n(00:39:45):\nAnd then the second piece is that we work really hard on just addressing what's the success here looks like? What is it that we're building? What use cases are we building for? And then because we hire these people that are so passionate about it, the other two skills, by the way, that are super important is high agency and high autonomy. I can figure out things that are tangential to me that I don't need other specialties, so to speak. I don't need a marketer to go launch something, I can go figure it out. And I have high agency, I can go do it myself. I'm going to own it all the way from start to finish. Those are very important, something that we screen for and something that we look for in our culture.\n\n(00:40:25):\nAnd then you just see... What you want to do is up to you. So there's very little supervision that happens on the ground. Now, we all have goals and some of the big launches that we're all marching towards, but some of the work that is completely up to developers, up to marketers or whatever, what is it that they want to do? So there has to be that enablement of go try things. And because of our velocity, if you fail, it's not a big deal. We'll just pivot, we will get through it. We are not here to just win all the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:00):\nOn the hiring of these incredible people, as we all know, it's very hard to hire people these days, especially the best. What have you seen Lovable does differently or does well that helps them recruit the best?\n\nElena Verna (00:41:10):\nYes, and especially recruit in Stockholm.",

What have you seen Lovable does differently or does well that helps them recruit the best?\n\nElena Verna (00:41:10):\nYes, and especially recruit in Stockholm. The main office here is in Stockholm. We're asking a lot of people to relocate, which is no small feat. Now some of it makes it easy, because of how much hype we created around our product. People want to come work for us. They're reaching out to us. They're saying, \"I love what you're doing, I want to join it.\" So that we have a cheat code to it, because we have... Most of the time when we reach out to somebody, they say, \"Yeah, I would love to explore.\" So building that product that is highly lovable also creates a really great recruiting brand for you as well. So make sure that there's multiple benefits to that.\n\n(00:41:49):\nBut second of all, we do a lot of trials for people. So trial work to see them in action.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:56):\nYeah, a work trial.\n\nElena Verna (00:41:57):\nA work trial to see them in action for a couple of days. We pay them as part of the work trial. We have some probation periods that we start people on, because this company is not for everybody. As I said in the podcast in the beginning, the pace here is insane. I went on vacation for the first time. So I've been here for six months. I went on vacation for 10 days. I came back, I felt like I needed to onboard from the beginning. Everything changed.\n\n(00:42:26):\nAnd when I'm in it, I feel like it's an evolution. But the fact that just being gone for 10 days, it feels like a complete revolution in the company. That pace is just not for everybody, and that's okay. Because I'm a very firm believer that there's different cultures and different environments that the best fit for different personalities and different people.\n\n(00:42:44):\nSo we try to be very upfront with how things are and how chaotic they are, and we prioritize people that don't look for clarity. We can create clarity out of chaos because it is absolutely chaotic otherwise. And if we start to look for people that can explain it to us, that's the only way that we can succeed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:06):\nThe way you described going on vacation and it feeling very different, it feels like when you don't see your kid for a few days and they're just completely different. You're like, \"How did you grow up so fast in three days?\"\n\nElena Verna (00:43:16):\nYeah, exactly. Exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:17):\nLet me try to summarize the growth levers that you're finding are working, and I'm trying to think about this from the perspective of an AI startup trying to think about, \"Hey, shoot, how do we grow faster? What has Lovable figured out?\" So it feels like number one is just build something lovable, something that blows people's socks off, but also in a market that is growing that people want to pay money for. You can build something lovable that nobody actually cares about, that there isn't much money going to this space. There's no tide pushing it forward, and it won't work.\n\nElena Verna (00:43:46):\nI call it minimum lovable product. It shouldn't be minimal viable product anymore. Viability is left back in 2010s. Now it's minimal lovable product. That's the only thing that matters.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:59):\nI love how these AI tools are letting us... PMs have always had these smoke door test, or what's the term? Or it's not a real product. Paint the door.\n\nElena Verna (00:44:11):\nPaint the door. Paint the door.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:11):\nPaint the door, there it is.\n\nElena Verna (00:44:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:12):\nYeah. And it's like, okay, we just have a landing page. There's nothing there. And now AI makes it easier to do that, and it's more full-featured.\n\nElena Verna (00:44:18):\nYeah. Well, it's the feedback cycle. It's just completely collapsed. You can go from idea to some product that is functioning to user feedback within a day if you want to, depending on how fast that you want to run or how complex the product is. For missions, it took us a couple of weeks to vibe code it to the point to where... I have a full-time vibe coder on my team. He's amazing. So he wanted to create videos. He did a bunch of designs for it too. It took him a couple of weeks, we're testing it now and then we'll push it in the product. But it's a completely different development lifecycle.\n\n(00:44:54):\nBefore, it would just take so many more steps from user research to the design sprints, to prioritizing an engineering roadmap, to build something minimal and viable to actually test to little long testing cycles. Now it's just like, \"Boom, let's go.\" It could have taken us a day, we just decided to take a couple of weeks to get all of the video pieces correct.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:",

Now it's just like, \"Boom, let's go.\" It could have taken us a day, we just decided to take a couple of weeks to get all of the video pieces correct.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:19):\nI saw you launch this on LinkedIn. To me, it looked like a full product launch. It is interesting to hear this is just a prototype.\n\nElena Verna (00:45:26):\nYeah, it's minimum lovable product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:30):\nMinimum lovable product. Okay, I got to ask you, you said you had a full-time vibe coder. What the heck is this? Is this an engineer? Is this something else? What is a full-time vibe coder?\n\nElena Verna (00:45:38):\nGreat question. This is a new job role that is actually popping up here and there. It's absolutely fascinating to watch this development, because I see vibe coding as a skill being added to a lot of job descriptions. For designers, for product managers, for marketers, which I think is a really interesting shift. Finally, Excel can move over. We have a new skill to add that is super empowering and not-\n\nElena Verna (00:46:00):\n... it's super empowering and I'm not 30 years old, but vibe coder, so his name is Lazar and he actually was chief of staff in his previous role so he's not technical at all. He's self-taught in technical aspects of it, but he was very early on in the vibe coding wave so he learned a lot about it. He was user of all of the vibe coding tools, Lovable included.\n\n(00:46:26):\nAnd when I was coming into the role, I'm like, \"I have so many projects that I will vibe code myself,\" so I run this woman only hackathon, SheBuilds. I vibe coded the first version of that site and submission process for applications, and then other people came in and started building on top of it. But I vibe coded, but then I don't have enough time sometimes because I need to run around and I want to push out so many different initiatives that I want to test in the market with our own product. So we connected on social and I'm like, \"Would you join us?\" And he joined us first part-time. I'm like, \"You're bringing so much value.\"\n\n(00:47:03):\nFor example, we partnered with Shopify, and he created a bunch of Shopify Lovable templates, vibe coded for us. And it's been so helpful to have somebody like that that is just pushing all of these things out. And he's an absolute expert, so he's teaching us all too of what is possible with Lovable because he's on the cutting edge of constantly pushing it to the limit. I really enjoy having that role, which I've never had before in my life and in my team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:31):\nI'm not surprised. I've never heard of this role before as a real full-time job. Do you think this is a thing people will start hiring for at non-vibe coding companies?\n\nElena Verna (00:47:41):\nI vibe code myself so I would put that as even as a skill on my resume now. It took me a while to figure out, by the way, everybody's like, \"Oh, you just go in and it all happens automatically.\"\n\n(00:47:52):\nIt takes you a couple of iterations, couple of projects until you know, okay, this is how I need to translate it, how I need to think about it. But for me, it's when I started scaling of what I want to vibe code, that's where his value really came in because I'm like, \"Okay, I understand what is possible. I know what needs to be achieved.\" And some of these apps, I want to be almost full-blown built because they're not going to get incorporated into the product anytime soon. They don't need to be. I'll just link to them from our header, so to speak. And he really accelerated that velocity for me.\n\n(00:48:23):\nSo once you get into vibe coding and you see its value within your organization, leaning into somebody like that, just accelerates your velocity because it is like an engineer on your team. It's just they're not, to me, he's part technical, but they can be non-technical if they're really good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:40):\nThat is fascinating.\n\n(00:48:41):\nThis episode is brought to you by Persona, the verified identity platform, helping organizations onboard users, fight fraud, and build trust.

Thanks again to Persona for sponsoring this episode.\n\n(00:49:47):\nLet me go back to summarize just real quick the growth levers, I want to move in a somewhat different direction. Things that help Lovable grow. One is just build something that blows your socks off, as you said. I love these phrases out here. The second is make noise in the market. And the way that Lovable does this, the CEO's tweeting constantly. You build something that blows people's socks off so that they share things on socials themselves, plus this influencer marketing component, and just this idea of building in public has been really helpful. This point about activation being embedded within the product team of the AI agent essentially, so it's essentially not the growth team thinking about activation. It's the product team that is building the AI magic that is obsessed with activation. It feels like those are the main growth levers. Is there anything else that I missed?\n\nElena Verna (00:50:38):\nCommunity. I think community is really important here because you need to bring people together as they're exploring these capabilities and as they're seeing what's possible so they can bounce off each other and they can help each other out. I would say community also amplifies that word of mouth. It amplifies all of the social posting. It amplifies retention mechanisms for you as well. The community has been a huge part of Lovable's success as well, and that's something that was started very early on.\n\n(00:51:05):\nIt runs on Discord, so it's nothing fancy. It's not like we build anything completely from scratch for ourselves. And it has hundreds of thousands of members and it's very lively. We have community managers that are making sure that all of the questions get answered and the right groups are being created. We have incredible ambassador program now as well of people doing it. I would say community here, again, of really making software more human is very important role. Now, obviously not everybody can build a community, but maybe at least plugging in into somebody's community is quite important as well. And then there's another one, unless you have a question on community.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:46):\nNo, keep going.\n\nElena Verna (00:51:48):\nAnother one is giving your product away a lot. And for AI products, it may feel counterintuitive because they're so costly. Every single interaction with an AI product costs companies something. There's an LLM pass-through cost that is coming through. And a lot of, especially traditional tech companies I see are gating AI immediately behind the paywall because they're sitting on a really cush, high margin profile, and the moment that you start giving AI away for free, you're cutting into those margins like a knife through the butter. Now, at the same time, AI being so new and the capabilities being so new, you have to remove the barrier of entry. You have to give a lot of your product away for free. But by the way, I don't just mean freemium. Freemium to me is just a baseline. If you're in the new category, you need to let people explore what it is free and get that initial wow moment.\n\n(00:52:48):\nIt's not aha moment, by the way. It doesn't need to be aha moment anymore. It just needs to be a wow moment. And for Lovable, it's that first preview generation after your first prompt, even though it's absolutely not going to be complete thing of what you want to build, but you just go, \"This is possible? I had no idea. I want to keep building.\" And it becomes an addictive exercise.\n\n(00:53:08):\nBut we also give so many of our Lovable credits away to every event, to every hackathon. If you want to host a Lovable hackathon, we will sponsor it and give all of the participants credits away for free. We give them away as candy and we basically track them over our LLM costs on freemium and giveaways as our marketing costs, and it doesn't go into our something we need to reduce to make our margins better. It goes into, this is something that we need to spend more in because this is part of our growth secret sauce.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:41):\nOkay, I want to hear more about the growth secret sauce. That is extremely interesting. I haven't heard of that as a strategy, and I can see why this makes sense. If the strategy is blow people's socks off so they can tell their friends, post on all socials, the trick is get more people to try it. And it's such a new, crazy thing. Why would I pay money? Why would I even go take the effort to try sign up for an account? I don't know what this is. I don't know what I'm doing with it. So I could see how this loop goes faster and faster by giving it away.\n\nElena Verna (00:54:10):\nExactly. And again, this is very uncomfortable sometimes for companies that A, either used to really... AI companies have lower profile of margins. That's absolutely true. To find an AI company with 80%, 90% margin profile is absolutely impossible, let's be real. We're all sitting somewhere in a 40% or so, which is a lot smaller",

To find an AI company with 80%, 90% margin profile is absolutely impossible, let's be real. We're all sitting somewhere in a 40% or so, which is a lot smaller. So any time that you look at those AI costs as your cost center, that's when you're in trouble. You fundamentally have to flip the script and say, \"I need to expose to people of what is possible and I need to remove the monetization friction out of it.\" Because if you don't, nobody's ever going to try it, or you're going to be very easily overtaken by a competitor that will give it away. And let's face it, once you hook people, they're more likely going to stay with you. So you obviously have to still work on the retention strategy there.\n\n(00:54:59):\nBut if you can have, like for our case, if somebody, one of our users stands up and say, \"Hey, I'm going to have a hackathon at my work on Lovable. Can you give us all some free credits to play with?\" Why would we prevent a person who wants to do all of the marketing and activating job for us in their company from using us?\n\n(00:55:21):\nOf course, we're like, \"Take it. How much do you need? How much would you like? We will sponsor it all. We will give you anything that you need.\" So we're really leaning into people that are wanting to show this magic to those around you and empowering them as much as possible. And that is something that is actually applies to every single product. And I agree, this is not a growth strategy that I've ever applied in my life on giving product away as much as possible, but it is something that is more and more becoming something that I see that is absolutely non-negotiable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:51):\nWhat I'm feeling is the more mind-blowing it is, the more you should give it away for free.\n\nElena Verna (00:55:56):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:57):\nEspecially in a competitive market where everyone is... It's hard. There's so many companies trying to do this thing, and so it's almost like the better you are, the more you should give it away.\n\nElena Verna (00:56:07):\nRight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:08):\nAnd this also explains why so much VC money has to be raised for these sorts of companies because this is not cheap. Like you said, you're paying all these foundational models a lot of money.\n\nElena Verna (00:56:16):\nYes and no. I'm only going to say no is because, so take a look at Lovable, we're over 200 million in ARR. At this point, we're 100 people large so our headcount costs are very low.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:28):\nWait, let me just make sure people hear that. 200 million ARR, I didn't realize 100 people work at Lovable.\n\nElena Verna (00:56:36):\nYes. And six months ago, we had 30 people working at Lovable so we triple. So for us, it's a really big deal. We tripled our company size.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:44):\nSuch a big company now.\n\nElena Verna (00:56:44):\nWe're going to quadruple it by the end of, yeah, I know. We're big boy and girls now. But for perspective of the headcount costs, it's minimal. We have very little in that going on. We are not spending a lot on paid marketing so we're not a big paid marketing driver. Yeah, we're spending on influencer marketing, but it's not majority of our growth. It's low double digits to be fair because it's not why we're successful. It's amplifying our success and it's helping us reach new audiences. We don't have really large sales team, we have only a couple sales folks, and they're just starting to ramp up their enterprise efforts so we don't have really big enterprise demand gen costs as well.\n\n(00:57:24):\nFrom that perspective, if you look at the equation and you say, \"Well, okay, if you're not going to do a lot of paid marketing, if you're not going to do a lot of sales, because we're really only working on hand raisers of people that are saying right now that they want to buy Lovable, then whereas you don't have big costs, so you can spend it on product.\"\n\n(00:57:42):\nThat is the beautiful part because when we are giving our product away to our customers, we're not competing with other companies in that space, because they're just going to use Lovable in their hackathon. We're on their own, and we're not competing on AdWords or in paid Google where everybody's buying real estate for eyeballs. From that perspective, I think about it more as a shift of where we spend in costs. And honestly, it's more efficient way to do paid marketing almost in a sense because of the cost per eyeball that we get there is quite a bit lower compared to if we were trying to compete it on Google. So yes and no to your statement because it actually does not deteriorate margin profile. We're just shifting of where we're spending it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:30):\nThat is an incredibly important point you're making there. It's not like you're generating an incredible",

We're just shifting of where we're spending it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:30):\nThat is an incredibly important point you're making there. It's not like you're generating an incredible amount of revenue, so there is money available to spend. And what you're saying is because it's been spreading through word of mouth mostly, you're not spending tons of money on salespeople, you're not spending tons of money on paid ads. This is just an amazing way to get more people to use it, so it's like a marketing cost.\n\nElena Verna (00:58:54):\nThis is product-led growth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:58):\nSupercharge.\n\nElena Verna (00:58:59):\nTo the max, supercharged. Yes, because you're literally using your product to drive that awareness by giving it away to the agents in your ecosystem that will do that distribution for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:11):\nSo fascinating. What a wild world we're living in. Free stuff for everyone.\n\nElena Verna (00:59:17):\nYes. I mean, it's great for consumers. This is a great time to be a consumer. You have so many options. Everybody's throwing themselves at you, giving your product away for free so it's great to be in the market right now. I think the power should be with consumer always, but with software, power has not been with consumer previously because we were forced to use towards some solutions because of either how they were chosen for us or what was available in the market. And now that supply is almost infinite, the demand from the consumers can be very picky and the one that serves the best will win.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:52):\nAnd I think again, it's important to highlight. This is not some kind of VC subsidized bubble-ish sort of thing. There is a lot of money being generated that you are spending to help it grow faster. It's not some kind of, we're just raising more money to give away more money. You're actually making your own money. It's not driven by VC money. Obviously, it helps.\n\nElena Verna (01:00:09):\nI can't comment on specific margin details for us, but at the same time, the money that we're raising on VC is for future development and hardening our business, not because we will not be able to survive without it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:22):\nAwesome. Okay, great segue too. I want to talk about product-market fit in competition. You have this really interesting post that I don't think people grasp yet, which is that product-market fit is no longer this, we've done it. Product-market fit and we're up into the right. Now we just grow, go, grow. Now we hire salespeople, it's going to be great. You've written that just product-market fit is no longer this like you've done it and you're good. It's this endless fight to keep it. Talk about what you're seeing there.\n\nElena Verna (01:00:49):\nI'll first start with what I've felt at least before when people were talking about product-market fit, that yeah, obviously always product-market fit is an evolving thing, but the rate of that evolution was measured in years. What is it that you need the next product-market fit step function change, which often was called second horizon or third horizon. Sometimes five, 10 years, sometimes even longer that you'd need, depending on how good and hard your initial product-market fit was, but you'd spend years scaling the original product-market fit. It was like blitz growth stage. Marketing, sales, growth was very important that you just try to get it to as many people as possible. And then once you have saturation or the cost to getting to the marginal people becomes too high, you start thinking, \"Okay, what else can I offer to help me reach additional people or sell more to existing users that I already have?\"\n\n(01:01:39):\nAnd again, the main point here is it would take years to get to that stage where it became a question that you had to face really hard face-to-face. Now, it's three months, and all of a sudden you have to face that question again. And it's happening because of two things, in my opinion. Number one, in AI technology of what LLM is capable of doing changes still very rapidly with new model release, with each new model release. I think we'll stabilize at some point and then it's going to become more marginal, but we're not there yet. So every three months or so, every single AI LLM provider creates a step function change in what is possible with that LLM. And when you have this new possibility in just an underlying technology that opens up in front of you, then it creates another ceiling of what is possible to build on top of it.\n\n(01:02:36):\nThe tricky piece here is that it's not enough to just wait for that technology to get better and then start building on top. You have to build beforehand to make a bet and then it's the LLM to catch up because when that model releases, you already need to have that functionality available. That piece is, I've never been in a company where the fundamental capabilities are still changing so rapidly, and that's the product part. The product can leap to the new expectations, but let's not talk about the market part as well. Consumer expectations have never changed this fast before. What we expected ChatGPT to be able to do and answer and how",

That piece is, I've never been in a company where the fundamental capabilities are still changing so rapidly, and that's the product part. The product can leap to the new expectations, but let's not talk about the market part as well. Consumer expectations have never changed this fast before. What we expected ChatGPT to be able to do and answer and how we wanted it to talk to us eight months ago versus now is night and day and the deep thinking mode, and how deeply you can go into answering questions and what is capable of building on top of it.\n\n(01:03:31):\nConsumer perception has never changed this fast too. It's this unprecedented time of consumers all of a sudden in a month saying, \"Oh, it's not doing this yet. I'm bouncing.\"\n\n(01:03:43):\nBefore, again, consumer perceptions would be years to take. It's actually technology would sometimes be able to already address it, but consumer perception has not been changed yet so it would take a long time. We're in this really weird part where both product and market is shifting so rapidly that every three months, I feel like we have to recapture our product-market fit and not just recapture on the same technology and with same customers. It's both of those pieces of the equation change every three months, and it's terrifying in a way. It's also very confusing in a way because we're $200 million company, and we're not solely focused on marketing and sales because we still have to recapture our product-market fit.\n\n(01:04:26):\nYou know that the team that finds your product-market fit is very different than the team that usually scales your company, yet we have to find the team that is capable of doing both on ongoing basis. Now, I think every AI company is on this product-market fit treadmill. Hopefully that treadmill speed slows down. If not, I think we're going to come up with crazy things of what this LLM and AI will be able to do if it's going to continue at this cusp, but it's a weird place to be in because every three months we have to throttle on our scaling efforts and just reinvent and then scale again. But it's like short blitz of growth, not these long year long commitments.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:09):\nWhat makes this very real is just this week, apparently OpenAI had this whole code red moment where even though OpenAI by far the leading AI assistant over almost a billion, I think monthly active users, basically synonymous with AI around the world, with Gemini 3 launching, their market share just started to dip really quickly. I think they lost six something percent in a week. And so even OpenAI, ChatGPT, the original, the one that everyone uses constantly is in danger.\n\nElena Verna (01:05:39):\nIt's like nobody's future is bulletproof yet. And 10 years ago, if you asked me if a $200 million company was at risk in losing product-market fit in the next three months if it's experiencing 10% month-over-month growth, I would've said, \"You're crazy.\" And now that's the reality that we live in. And I don't know, it's fascinating to world in. What a time to be alive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:04):\nTime to be alive and very stressful, but the prize at the end is massive. That's why this is worth doing, not just monetarily, but just the impact it's going to have on the world, the way we people build and ship.\n\nElena Verna (01:06:17):\nExactly. The ceiling of what is possible has been raised so massively that we haven't even became too closest to even see it, I believe. I think that that's the exciting part of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:29):\nThe way I've seen you write about this product-market fit challenge is the traditional approach is you have these core users that are using it happy with it, and then you expand to the adjacent users and expand to the next. You're basically just trying to recapture that same core constantly and don't even have time to go adjacent.\n\nElena Verna (01:06:44):\nYeah. Bangaly wrote a really wonderful article. It was many years ago at this point on adjacent user theory in that your product-market fit expansion when you're in no growth stages, the biggest opportunity for you to go after is this what you call the adjacent user, which are just outside of your core user. They have somewhat similar needs, but maybe they're in different geo, maybe they have slightly different use case, slightly different needs. And your biggest way to continue growing a product-market fit without having to go to next horizon is to capture that next group of users. The interesting piece here of how I relate to it, we still have the core users. And by the way, those core users are mostly pioneers right now that are excited by the capabilities. Then there's latent majority that is filled with adjacent users. And the issue right now, which I'm actually quite worried about us as a category is that we're constantly focusing on recapturing the pioneers.\n\n(01:07:39):\nWe don't have time to go after adjacent users, and I'm worried of whether there's going to be a gap in the space where we actually going to alienate the latent majority because we're so hyper focused on just staying top of mind and top capabilities on the pioneers. But I don't know the right answer here, because without the pioneers, you need pioneers for latent majority to follow. But if you take pioneers and you take them too far into capabilities, will latent majority never be able to catch up? Maybe this is a fruitless concern, but it's just something that I think about because",

But if you take pioneers and you take them too far into capabilities, will latent majority never be able to catch up? Maybe this is a fruitless concern, but it's just something that I think about because at this stage we should be working on adjacent users. I would argue maybe OpenAI definitely started to do that with how many people they have on their platform, but not most of the other AI companies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:31):\nI completely see what you're thinking there. A brand could just become known as that's just for startups and prototyping and it's not for serious work.\n\nElena Verna (01:08:38):\nYeah, or it's for techies. It's for tech people. It never actually enters the people outside of our little bubble that we live in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:50):\nWe touched on this a little bit of just working in AI, working on AI companies, challenging, stressful, a lot of work. What's your advice for folks that are thinking about, should I join a Lovable? Should I join a Cursor? Should I-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:00):\n... are thinking about, \"Should I join a Lovable? Should I join a Cursor? Should I just go work at Google?\"\n\n(01:09:05):\nNot to throw them under the bus or anything. Although Google, very, very successful in AI now, maybe a less AI-focused company.\n\nElena Verna (01:09:13):\nI really believe that there's different... You need to understand what's the environment that is right for you. Just please understand that AI companies are very hectic at the moment. They're very unstable by definition of that product-market fit treadmill, about that distribution of how they're actually distribute to the market, really changing about how product is even being developed in the first place. So if you are very comfortable in being in that messy middle and really comfortable of converting chaos into clarity for you and those around you, then yeah, AI company is a wonderful place for you to really absorb new skill sets right now. Because even before joining Lovable, when I kept seeing AI, I'm like, \"My gosh, I'm so tired of seeing AI everywhere. Is it really changing the world? Is it really changing the way people work?\"\n\n(01:10:02):\nAnd I was at Dropbox before, and yeah, we would use AI here and there and I would use ChatGPT. I've never used AI there the way I use AI at Lovable and the things that I'm capable of accomplishing at Lovable, and I don't know if I ever would've made that leap so fast unless I joined Lovable. If I would've just read or listened about it, it's just different compared to be surrounded by people where it's expectation. It's not like a nice-to-have or something that somebody's asking you to do. This is just how you get things done. And you have to think about everything of, \"What can AI do here versus where do I add value versus in a traditional sense of work?\" because I start with my own value and then I augment it with AI. And here, the mindset has completely shifted.\n\n(01:10:47):\nNow, I don't think AI is replacing everybody's job, so please don't look at it as that cliche saying. I actually often call AI as average intelligence that helps me get the platform up. And then I add my human thinking and my human creativity on top of it to get it to the next level. But at least I can get this base level done with AI really freaking quickly.\n\n(01:11:11):\nSo from that perspective, I think if you want to leapfrog on what it means to be AI native employee and how to use all of these AI tools, you should go to AI company. But if you know that your superpower is in more structure and more definition and a really high specialty of things, because in AI companies, they're all fairly small, so you'll have to generalize quite a bit and have a lot of ownership, all of areas that you usually maybe not have ownership over, then you shouldn't join it, because AI companies will evolve to be more stable too.\n\n(01:11:43):\nSo it's just a matter of time on where you can join. So I would just urge people to look at their superpowers and the type of environments that really speak to them so they can feel happy, because this can lead to burnout for wrong type of personalities very quickly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:00):\nYeah. My sense is if you want work-life balance, don't join one of these companies, because that's just not the way they work.\n\nElena Verna (01:12:07):\nI don't know if I'd go that far. I mean, I have family, I have two kids. I feel like I have a very good work-life balance, but I put in boundaries for myself. I know when I need time off because I know when my brain starts to overheat, so to speak. But I also know that work is my hobby and it's my passion, and this is the best work of my life that I'm doing right now. There's no other place that I'd rather be than to be here.\n\n(01:12:33):\nSo I think that you just need to be more careful about setting your own boundaries that you know you need. But I mean, let's face it, I don't think anybody has work-life balance, regardless of a company that they work at, even at",

There's no other place that I'd rather be than to be here.\n\n(01:12:33):\nSo I think that you just need to be more careful about setting your own boundaries that you know you need. But I mean, let's face it, I don't think anybody has work-life balance, regardless of a company that they work at, even at Google or Microsoft or any of the others. I think everybody's freaking out and running as fast as they can, it's just they're running it in different structures.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:58):\nI'm really glad you said that and corrected me there, that it is possible to work at a company, one of, if not the fastest-growing company in history and actually have work-life balance to get sleep, to spend time with your kids and family.\n\nElena Verna (01:13:11):\nYou just have to protect it ruthlessly, but you also need to be realistic with how much is expected out of you, and you need to feel confident that you'll be able to deliver it. And by the way, you won't be able to deliver it unless you use AI in many aspects of your work life. So that's the piece that helps you actually get to hit those expectations of outcomes that you need to do and the velocity. But I'm very protective of my personal time with kids. Why did I have children if I'm not going to spend time with them? So those are part of the non-negotiables that I bring along with me in every single work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:47):\nFor people that maybe have trouble setting boundaries or just not good at this, anything, what works for you? Is it as easy as just telling people, \"Here's where I need to leave\"? What advice do you have for people to set boundaries like that?\n\nElena Verna (01:13:59):\nSo first of all, I would not think about it as a work-life balance. There's no such thing as balance. So balance feels like, \"Oh, I have enough time for everything.\"\n\n(01:14:05):\nI don't have enough time for anything, but I prioritize my family in some moments, I prioritize work in other moments, and I don't try to balance the two. I go where I'm needed and where I go, and I feel like I'm not going to regret the choices that I'm making today. So I'm constantly trying to put myself in the future and say, \"Will I resent myself if I make this choice right now?\" And if the answer is yes, I don't make that choice.\n\n(01:14:29):\nAnd sometimes I have to say no to Anton and say, \"I can't make it,\" or, \"I won't be there. I need to be here with my family,\" or, \"Today I need to cancel my day. My kid is sick and he needs me, and I need to take him to the doctor.\"\n\n(01:14:43):\nSo I think that just making in the moment, in every day, when sometimes in-the-hour decisions, to me, works better than trying to balance something that is completely unachievable and it feels overwhelming to even think about. But I prioritize this in my sleep, my health, my workout schedule, my kids, my family, my husband, and just my downtime because I know that I'm most creative once I have separation from work, because then I come in with all cylinders firing and I have so many more ideas about it. So to me, it's actually part of doing my best work is to take time off.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:18):\nThat is really great advice. I want to touch on what it's like to work at Lovable because it feels like Lovable is at the cutting edge of what working in product is going to be. So you mentioned a little bit about how you're always talking to AI, asking questions. Is there any other kind of anecdotes of just how people operate at Lovable that is really unique or weird or funny or interesting that might be helpful for people to try in their company?\n\nElena Verna (01:15:43):\nYeah. I mean, we use Lovable at Lovable a lot. All of our internal tools are built on Lovables. We actually have our first hackathon on Lovable happening next week, where our entire company is just going to take full day to vibe code and see what we actually have happen. We prototype everything on Lovable. So our specs, yeah, we do still have a written spec, but it always accompanied by a lovable prototype that everybody can interact with and to click around with and provide feedback. And everybody bunches in and also does some edits if they have any better ideas.\n\n(01:16:16):\nSo I create mocks on Lovable. So for example, we need to make some pricing changes, or pricing page changes. I take a screenshot of our pricing page. I go to Lovable as I recreate this pricing page, make these changes, and then I send that to my engineering team saying, \"Hey, this is what I want to happen.\" And then they take it from there.\n\n(01:16:37):\nAnd ChatGPT, I use a lot for brainstorming, especially the deep thinking mode. I love it. It takes a long time, but it's so worth it. Sometimes it has crazy ideas. Sometimes it was like, \"Yeah, this is nothing new to me.\" So it's not interesting, but it gets me thinking and it gives me a look at the different angles.\n\n(01:16:56):\nAnd I use Granola a lot, for example, because to me, it's super helpful to",

I use Wispr Flow a lot because I feel like I have no time to type anymore. So I just talk to my phone and talk to my laptop all the time in order to do it. But we're even thinking about all of the customer support automations that are done through AI. Every single aspect of what we do, question is asked, what can AI do here first, and then how we can add ourselves into the equation.\n\n(01:17:33):\nBut Lovable for us, having unlimited credits at Lovable is a pretty awesome perk, I have to say. I sometimes have to pinch myself. I'm like, \"I get paid to vibe code.\" It looks so fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:46):\nFeel like that engineer, that vibe code engineer, he's actually getting paid to vibe code.\n\nElena Verna (01:17:48):\nHe has my dream job. I want his job.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:50):\nYeah, exactly. Exactly.\n\nElena Verna (01:17:51):\nYeah, I got into the wrong line profession here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:55):\nOh, man. Okay. Is there anything else about Lovable? Because what I think about, actually, I interviewed the Perplexity founders back in the day years ago. Before we talked to anyone for advice, we first asked ChatGPT, and I was just like, \"That is the most insane thing I've ever heard. How can you possibly work that way?\"\n\n(01:18:11):\nAnd now that's how everyone works. And so I'm curious, I don't know how Anton works. Is there anyone else that's just way in the future of here's how things might be?\n\nElena Verna (01:18:19):\nSo for me, especially for product and growth, and even marketing in some capacity, when I have an idea in my head, it sounds so freaking cool. And sometimes I put it on paper and it's like, \"Ah, we need to do it.\"\n\n(01:18:34):\nAnd then I go and try to vibe code it, and I'm like, \"Oh, I don't see the magic anymore,\" or I can't envision it anymore.\n\n(01:18:43):\nOr sometimes I'm like, \"Yeah. Yeah,\" and there's more, there's more. So to me, it actually has helped really complete the ideation process for me quite a bit, because then I actually try to go and build it, and it breaks down some of the elements of what's important, what's not. So it's taking me on a product development lifecycle so much further down. And then it creates a much better communication vehicle with my engineers too, because I then can tell them exactly what's important and whatnot.\n\n(01:19:12):\nSo to me, it's been great because sometimes we envision things that are so much better than the reality. And before, until it hands it off to design, designers would do it for us and try to make it awesome versus I often stop my ideas in tracks super early on without pushing it forward. Versus other times I might've pushed it for too far too long, even through design queue or even pitching to leadership. And I find that very powerful because it calibrates me really quickly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:44):\nAwesome. Okay. Last question. I want to talk about something that you've written about that I think it's a really important topic, something that we should surface, is you wrote this post called I'm Worried About Women In Tech. Talk about what you're seeing here, what you're noticing, what you think might be going in the wrong direction.\n\nElena Verna (01:20:00):\nYeah. There's actually conflicting data points about how women... You're talking about women, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:00):\nYeah, women in tech.\n\nElena Verna (01:20:06):\nWomen in tech? Yeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:06):\nYeah.\n\nElena Verna (01:20:07):\nThere's conflicting data points about how women are keeping up with AI technology and wave, because there's a bunch of reports that has been done that show massive gap between women adopting AI versus men adopting AI, which points the story that men are just widening the gap of accessibility for technology. And whoever's adopting AI right now is getting paid the most, gets the most opportunities. I mean, we're seeing insane acqui-hires right now, where people are getting paid more for their talent than for the companies that they've created. And that's a really interesting trend that is occurring, and a lot of it is fueled on this wave of AI.\n\n(01:20:47):\nAnd women are not really present there. If you can think about one million-dollar acqui-hire that has been in the news that is a woman, I can't think of one. If you look at AI companies and their CEOs, most of it is men. If you look at the company's composition in AI companies, it's mostly men. To me, this really came to the head of when I came to Lovable, and I'm like, \"It's pink, it's purple",

To me, this really came to the head of when I came to Lovable, and I'm like, \"It's pink, it's purple brand. It's a heart. It's lovable.\" I'm like, \"I'm sure this is where it's 50/50 men versus a woman.\"\n\n(01:21:20):\nAnd although we don't collect this information, but just through third-party autofill, we saw it's like 20% at most. And I'm like, \"What is happening? Not again. Why is this, again, not being adopted by a woman?\"\n\n(01:21:35):\nAnd obviously I don't know all of the answers. I think that this is early on that we can shortcut it. And by the way, I also don't want to put this as a indication that men are to blame because I think men are doing wonderful job really spearheading the horizons and showing us what's possible and leading the charge. I'm just afraid that so many women are stuck in that latent majority that is just not catching up. And my worry is that it's going to affect the hireable talent. It's going to step us back again in the composition of the workplace, of the diversity. And maybe it matters, maybe it doesn't, like whichever side that you sit on. But I think that it needs to be built for everybody in the world, and for that, it needs to be built by a representative sample of people that are behind the product as well.\n\n(01:22:23):\nSo I just find it fascinating that even when the barrier to building has been lowered versus you don't need computer science degree, which I appreciate there's not that many women that are getting. We're still seeing the gaping gap on the adoption between genders, which, I don't know, there's something very frustrating about that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:50):\nYeah. The thing that struck with me from your post is there has been a lot of progress being made in the last decade, and now AI is just kind of turning it all back, turning it all around.\n\nElena Verna (01:23:00):\nHopefully not. I think that we're early on enough that we can bridge the gap. I think sometimes women just need space and ability to discover it, and that's what we're doing at Lovable. We have this initiative, SheBuilds, where we create a hackathon for women only and we give them unlimited access to Lovable for 48 hours, and they come together as a community and they build together. And there's beautiful things that start to come out of it, which I've never anticipated before. But so many women in that hackathon for us build help with their elderly parents or with their kids or with the household or for their church group or for the kids' basketball team solutions, which have hyper-local, hyper-relevant, very needed for what they need in their life and something that was never been able to build before because of how expensive software was, because it would never going to become potentially a hundred-million-dollar companies, but it also doesn't need to be anymore.\n\n(01:24:01):\nSo I just want to bring women to build more and vibe code more so we can have more diversity in software that is even created because I think that we all have a unique take on what problems that we can solve, and I want everybody's voices to be heard.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:17):\nI'll give the URL for SheBuilds. I pulled it up while you're talking, shebuilds.lovable.app.\n\nElena Verna (01:24:23):\nIt's fully vibe coded on Lovable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:23):\nThat's so cool.\n\nElena Verna (01:24:25):\nIs there a minimum viable product?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):\nMinimal Lovable product.\n\nElena Verna (01:24:28):\nMinimal Lovable product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:29):\nThere it is. So when is this happening? Is this December 15th, 18th? Oh, yeah, it's coming up.\n\nElena Verna (01:24:33):\nYeah, we're running it constantly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):\nCool.\n\nElena Verna (01:24:36):\nSo our next cohort starts December 15th, but we're going to have more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):\nNow or never. Sweet.\n\nElena Verna (01:24:41):\nWe're planning a massive one on International Women's Day. So that's the one that if you can, come join us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:48):\nAwesome. Okay, so some glimmer of hope. I don't know if you saw this tweet where I tagged you the other day, or maybe it was today. I was looking at my most recent podcast video performance, and the top four are all women and they're all AI-oriented. And they're above Stewart Butterfield, founder of Slack, above Gamma's CEO, Grant, so maybe a glimmer of hope.\n\nElena Verna (01:25:10):\nYeah, absolutely. I think there's lots of glimmers of hope. I think we can just all lean in and make sure that nobody's left behind in this wave. And that's not to stop people that are marching ahead. This is just to open up opportunities",

Elena, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Is there anything else you want to remind people of before we get to your one-question lightning round?\n\nElena Verna (01:25:38):\nI guess the only other thing that I will share is for AI companies when it comes to hiring. It's really interesting, also, kind of the shift in the type of personas that end up being hired that I see. For me, at least it's quite different compared to anywhere that I worked before. And that is, there's this narrative going in the market always that new hires, sorry, new grads have no jobs in the market left because all of the entry-level jobs are automated.\n\n(01:26:07):\nI actually think that's quite false, because new grads, especially AI-native new grads... So it's very important for kids that are entering into the, I shouldn't say kids, young adults that are entering into the workforce that they really know AI, which there's another really big issue that our schools are not teaching AI students. So this is something else that we need to fix as a category, because otherwise we're literally setting up our young for a complete failure. But I think it's incredible to see some of those new graduates come in and what they're capable of doing.\n\n(01:26:43):\nWe have multiple new graduates at Lovable that are working, and I learned so much from them. And you need to obviously have the right atmosphere where people with experience, like a old guard like me, that can look at the new guard and really hear them and see them and really change the way that I operate based on how they do things. So make sure that you bring some of that fresh talent that doesn't understand any of the baggage that we came from and that can really look at the future in technology and what can unlock from a completely new lens. So highly recommend putting those into your team as little fireballs that are going to be sometimes hard to contain but can start the best initiatives for you forward.\n\n(01:27:32):\nAnd then it's also interesting that there's a really high demand for ex-founders now, for those people that truly have a lot of agency and high autonomy. So instead of just having people that have been working in the corporate world, the failed startup founders are now hot demand for a lot of these AI companies. So these personas that we traditionally would not prioritize in companies to hire are now becoming the hottest commodity and the highest-going talent, which I think is fascinating and is the wonderful thing that is changing how the culture inside operates.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:09):\nThat is really interesting and really empowering, just this idea that if you need grad, there's hope. You're not going to be out of a job.\n\nElena Verna (01:28:09):\nAbsolutely. Absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:16):\nAnd you might have an advantage. Yeah.\n\nElena Verna (01:28:18):\nYou have to lead with that. That's the thing. You have to lead with the things that you are capable of achieving, knowing what you have with AI, because that is a lot of people. Especially in traditional tech or in more traditional companies, they're looking for somebody to show them because it's really hard to figure it out on your own versus coming in and seeing and then copying.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:37):\nWell, Elena, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Because it's your fourth time, I'm not going to ask you all the questions I always ask you. So I'm just going to ask you one question. So Lovable is based in Stockholm, Sweden. I'm curious, just what's something you love about Stockholm that you weren't expecting? Is there a food, a restaurant? I don't know, something.\n\nElena Verna (01:28:55):\nWell, you always have to say Swedish meatballs. I mean, I've never liked meatballs before, and now it's so good here. It's so good. So every time, one of my meals here throughout the day involves it. But I actually really love their-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:11):\nIt sounds really good. I actually haven't yet.\n\nElena Verna (01:29:14):\nYeah. I don't know, they just taste different and they're-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:16):\nAnd they smell like the Ikea. It's not like the Ikea Swedish meatballs.\n\nElena Verna (01:29:19):\nWell, I have been to Ikea here, because that is a Swedish company too. It reminded me of in-person Amazon. It was absolutely incredible. Ikea here is next level. But food, Swedish meatballs for sure. Honestly, how clean the city is, it's kind of incredible. The architecture, everything is so built out. It's picture perfect like it's on a card. I don't know. It's different compared to most of the large cities that I've been at that are little bit more worn down.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:49):\nSo fun. Makes me want to visit and",

I have my newsletter as well that baby steps compared to what Lenny has, but it's elenaverna.com. That's where I post most of my findings that I experience at my work. So if you want to continue seeing how my thinking evolves or the patterns that I notice, that's where to find me.\n\n(01:30:35):\nAnd how to be useful to me? Really pressure test my thinking because so many things are changing right now. I'm honestly not even sure myself of what is a pattern versus what is just a data point. So I'd love to just engage in as many conversations as possible and hear your opinions because that will help us as an industry just understand what is actually happening and makes more sense out of this whole thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:59):\nI'm just going to double click on your newsletter.

There's just so much theoretical conversation and examining the big blunders, but at the end of the day, if you're a startup that wants to get coverage for your company, you need to know actually the steps to take to do it.\n\nLenny (00:00:13):\nYou mentioned a bunch of amazing companies you've worked with, Ram Perplexity. Most products won't have this interesting of a story to tell. How do you help find something that is a nugget?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:00:21):\nYou can get so in the weeds with your own messaging that you want to set up this massive problem statement, you want to make it a huge trend story, but if you're very straightforward and you're pattern matching, it's generally actually going to work.\n\nLenny (00:00:32):\nSo I asked you to bring some examples of pitches that are great and also examples of pitches that could be better.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:00:39):\nI want to read one to you and then I want to see if you can tell me what this company does.\n\nLenny (00:00:44):\nDeal. Today, my guest is Emilie Gerber. Emilie is the founder and CEO of Six Eastern, a PR agency that has worked with over 100 tech companies, from stealth startups to publicly traded companies, helping them get press, build awareness, and level up their PR and comms strategy. Before starting her own firm, she worked at Uber where she led PR for the business development team and B2B programs. Prior to that, she worked at Box on product communications with a focus on product launches and partnership announcements. In our conversation, Emilie shares so many golden nuggets of advice on how to get press that I lost count.\n\n(00:01:23):\nWe talk about which publications to target depending on your market and story, how to craft your pitch and your outreach to reporters, how to actually reach reporters, and also how to craft your product story for people to pay attention to what you're doing, why warm introductions to reporters aren't actually that important, how to find podcasts and newsletters to pitch that might be even more effective than traditional media, how much it would cost you to work with a PR agency instead of doing it yourself, and how much lead time you need if you do that.\n\n(00:01:50):\nAlso, we go through a few real-life examples of press and outreach, both good examples and bad examples, and what we can learn from those. Also, we look at a pitch that Emilie sent to me about a podcast guest that is a client of hers that worked, and this guest is coming out in the future, so we look at what was effective about that pitch, and so much more.

Emilie, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:04:59):\nYeah, thank you for having me.\n\nLenny (00:05:01):\nSo we're going to be talking about press. A lot of people say that trying to get press isn't really worth your time. It doesn't drive signups, it doesn't drive growth. You could spend your time on other things and have a lot more impact there, and I know that you have a really interesting perspective on second order effects of press and other benefits. So I'm curious to hear, what's your perspective on this idea, that press isn't really worth people's time and how can press be helpful?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:05:27):\nYeah, when we were emailing about it, talking about some of the articles that you were in, some of the coverage that you got, I was thinking about how, in your case, you have multiple audiences. You have your customers, which in a way, are your listeners and the people that are engaging with your content. So in a way, you're a B2C business, but in another way, you're a B2B business. Obviously, you have sponsors and you're trying to attract really great guests to come on the show, and so there's a second order piece of the press is validating that you're something that a software company wants to sponsor. So internally, they're making those decisions. Not everyone might know Lenny's podcast, but they could send around a CNBC article and see that this is something very legit and something that people care about. It just signals that third-party validation that I think is really important, and that ties back to, when you look at a SaaS company or something and they're making decisions, having that validation, I think, and that credibility goes a really long way.\n\n(00:06:24):\nEspecially for a company that might be early stage, they've raised a little bit of money, I think sometimes the buyers are skeptical of engaging with new tools, because they're worried they might not raise more funding, or it might go away tomorrow, and so the more that you can validate the business through things that's not just you doing personally that other people are doing, I think the better. So I think, yeah, that's the value from the B2B perspective and it's not necessarily going to directly drive signups, but when that AE is sending their sales emails and they can link to a story, I think that really helps. Also, candidates too, when you're reaching... If it's a recruiter reaching out on LinkedIn and they only have 100 characters to make their pitch, linking to that story can be really powerful.\n\n(00:07:03):\nSo those are some of the second-order effects for B2B. And then, on the consumer side, it's a much more complex issue. There's affiliate marketing, which is this whole world of paid, where you're getting product reviews and that sort of thing, and that's not really an area that I'm an expert on, but we do work with some consumer companies where press is a major driver of growth. So for instance, Perplexity, they have invested essentially zero in any paid marketing, they don't have a marketing person even, but they do do PR. And so essentially, after their most recent announcement, they saw a massive spike in growth, a massive spike in signups, pro users, all of that. And I think, in that case, the reason PR works so well is...\n\n(00:07:47):\nFirst of all, it's something that's very easy to grasp. Google alternative. I know how to use Google, I've used Google a million times, you can go to perplexity.com. The barrier to trying the product is very low, you can quickly type in a query, get the answer, and then see the power of the tool. It takes one time to see the power of the tool. So in that case, I think just organic press is enough to generate that. There's not a long process to get the customers interested, so... Yeah. I mentioned very case to case, but in those instances, it works well,\n\nLenny (00:08:18):\nMan, there's so many threads I want to follow here. That was such an interesting answer. And by the way, I love Perplexity. I once tweeted a result I had when I was using Perplexity, and that was one of their default questions you could ask about strawberries. Apparently, strawberries are not one fruit, strawberries are a bundle of fruits and every little piece of a strawberry, those little red things, are individual fruits all bundled together, which blew my mind. I was like, \"I need to share this,\" and so I wonder how much of their growth just comes from crazy things like that.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:08:45):\nYeah, it's like the kind of tool where your mom could try it and instantly know how to use it. Yeah. It's good for weird questions, like what you just shared. That's where it comes in really handy.\n\nLenny (00:08:55):\nYou did a great job just defaulting, \"Here's weird questions you could ask,\" and then, wow, what an answer. Okay, so on the B2B side, I think this is really interesting. When people are thinking about doing the calculus of, \"Is it worth investing and trying to get press for a B2B business?\" Related to what we were talking about offline. So when I got these stories in Fast company, I got a story in CNBC, I got a story in Entrepreneur Magazine",

So when I got these stories in Fast company, I got a story in CNBC, I got a story in Entrepreneur Magazine, and I was telling you I've seen zero growth impact from all these stories. And you'd think like, \"Wow.\" I had a story in the magazine, Entrepreneur Magazine, print edition, and nothing comes from it as far as I can tell.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:09:30):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:09:30):\nAnd your point, which really stuck with me, is the real benefit isn't that first order growth impact, it's... And I've been doing this, it's when I'm emailing potential guests telling them, \"Hey, check out my work or my profile in these magazines.\" And just having those little logos is really powerful, and that's why you see those logos on people's websites. So is your advice here, basically, for B2B businesses than most? If the pie chart of impact of press, most of that percentage is just having a logo of an awesome publication on your website and your outbound emails, and things like that?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:10:06):\nYeah, the logo is a piece of it and then also the storytelling part. Maybe they're not going to read eight paragraphs that you wrote about your business, but if it's in the format of an article, I think they're more likely to take the time to do it. One other, I guess, aspect of it is content. So for instance, the articles that people want to write about you are not about necessarily how great your podcast is, which it is, but more about how you created this business. And so it's more through the lens of you're an entrepreneur, you have built this media empire, and so that's not necessarily the kind of story that's going to drive your core audience to sign up, and so contents is part of it, too. And so we work with companies where we get them great stories about their company culture and cool initiatives that they're doing, because reporters are interested in that topic. That's not going to help their sales, but it might help with something like recruiting. And so yeah, I think thinking... That's the other piece of it, is thinking through the content.\n\nLenny (00:11:03):\nThat's such a good point, because the story they're going to write about you isn't, \"This is the best product you've ever seen,\" this is, \"Look at this interesting journey this startup has gone on,\" and that's not going to convince your customers, it's going to convince other people just to read this publication, but the fact that they wrote about you is really beneficial. And then you're saying B2C, most of the benefit is actually driving growth and you've seen lots of examples of press driving significant growth.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:11:27):\nYeah, I think it can be and I think this is one where, yeah, it's a little more case-to-case, because we have some clients where they need to invest heavily in affiliate, because product reviews are what they need or they want to be on lists of the best vacuum cleaner, or whatever category, and it's less about getting them big features. And so there's different ways of doing it for B2C. But yeah, I do think it's like... Yeah, there's two camps, affiliate or not affiliate.\n\nLenny (00:12:00):\nCan you actually explain this affiliate bucket? Because I'm not actually that familiar with it.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:12:00):\nI can. However, we actually don't do affiliate marketing, so there's probably going to be a lot of people that have a much more insightful perspective on it, but affiliate is essentially when you work with a publication to give them a percentage of any sales that come from the piece of the article. And so if you look at Business Insider's list of best personal finance tools, it'll say at the top that they're getting commission. So they track the links, they figure out a certain percentage, and then they basically get a percentage of all the sales that come in, and it's very common. I would say most consumer companies are doing this, but yes, there's entire agencies that are dedicated to that field.\n\nLenny (00:12:38):\nWow, I didn't actually know that was such a big thing. I've heard of affiliate marketing where you get paid for promoting something, I didn't know Business Insider did this as a revenue.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:12:48):\nYeah, and I don't want to call out just... I mean, I would say every publication that's doing product reviews for the most part, I believe, it's a very common practice.\n\nLenny (00:12:58):\nWow. All right, already learning a lot. Okay, so I definitely want to start talking about how to actually get press for your product, but one quick question about fundraising announcements. So I'm an investor in a lot of companies, very often, they email me and ask for advice how to get press and, most of the time, it's a fundraising milestone. When is it worth investing trying to get press and fundraising? Like always worth trying, rarely worth your effort? Does it have to be some really impressive fundraising moment? What do you suggest?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:13:32):\nI also think not all PR people are going to agree with this, but I do think funding rounds, you can always get a reporter to cover if you go about it the right way. I mean, we",

Does it have to be some really impressive fundraising moment? What do you suggest?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:13:32):\nI also think not all PR people are going to agree with this, but I do think funding rounds, you can always get a reporter to cover if you go about it the right way. I mean, we scope out projects that are just for funding announcements, we've never had to not finish that project or we've never... I wouldn't do that if it wasn't possible, so I think there's a couple of reasons that it sometimes doesn't work out. But I guess just to take a step back on funding stories, a lot of founders automatically think that, \"I raise money, so TechCrunch will cover this.\" The reality is... Someone tweeted, actually someone from another agency, I should... Propeller PR, they tweeted that they counted how many funding stories TechCrunch did in a week, and it was nine, so they had written nine funding stories in one week. And then they counted how many funding rounds actually happened that week by looking at Axis Parata and Fortune Term Sheet, and it was like 50.\n\n(00:14:26):\nSo it seems... When you go to TechCrunch, it looks like, \"It's all funding stories, so mine should be one of these.\" That's not the case at all. But I do think, if you go about it the right way, you can be one of those nine. And I'm talking about TechCrunch specifically here only because the reality is they are the publication that's going to be most likely to write your funding story, that's just kind of the way it works. And it's not a bad thing, they're actually... They don't have a paywall, they tend to do a very good job, they understand it. It's a well-oiled machine, and so we know if you've done a story with them, it's going to pretty much go how you want to plan it. So when you go to pitch a funding story, I think the first thing that founders, or whoever is reaching out on behalf of the company, does wrong is they convolute the message.\n\n(00:15:10):\nWhen we pitch a funding story, we make it very clear, \"Hey, we're reaching out with a startup launch or funding. We're offering this to you as an exclusive, meaning we're not going to pitch anyone else if you take the story. Here's the amount that's raised, here's the space that... Here's the space they're in and here are the investors.\" I think you can get so in the weeds with your own messaging, that you want to set up this massive problem statement, you want to make it a huge trend story. You don't really say what you're trying to accomplish from it, but if you're very straightforward and you're pattern matching, \"Hey, this TechCrunch reporter is the one that covers FinTech. I have a FinTech funding round, here's the reason my FinTech funding round matters.\" It's generally actually going to work and now it does 100% takes follow up.\n\n(00:15:50):\nYou're not shooting off one email, you are respectfully following up. When I follow up, I like to come in with some new information, whether it's something they had tweeted in the past couple of days, a new article that they wrote, very respectful. I try to wait three or four days. If it's not going anywhere, then try someone else. Do that three or four times with the most relevant reporters. Generally, I think it works. Yeah, I think if you can just be really concise and direct and say what you're looking for out of the relationship, it tends to be a pretty easy process. And yeah, TechCrunch is one publication, but this actually goes for a bunch.\n\nLenny (00:16:24):\nAmazing. I love that we're already getting into tactical advice for how to actually get press. So that was essentially for fundraising and the notes I took is keep it really simple, \"Here's how much we raise, here's our investors. Here's one line about why this matters.\" I want to talk later about how pitching press is different for customers, because with customers, I think this is probably the mistake a lot of people make, and we don't have to get into this just yet, but you want to paint the picture of the market and trends and, \"Here's where the market's going and why this is huge and why this is a solution to your problem,\" versus, \"Bam, this is interesting for this reason,\" and that's it.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:16:56):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:16:57):\nOkay. I want to talk about publications to target and what each one is best suited for. So you're talking about how TechCrunch is essentially really good for fundraising. When I think about other publications, there's like Axios and Verge, I don't know if they do press stories like this. Wall Street Journal, New York Times, things like that. So I guess, what are the different publications people should have on their list of target? And then, what are each of them most aligned to, story-wise?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:17:28):\nI really love this question. I feel like no one ever gets this tactical in PR. There's just so much theoretical conversation and examining the big blunders and... It's all so high level, but at the end of the day, if you are a startup that wants to get coverage for your company, you need to know actually the steps to take to do it. So yeah, I appreciate that question. I'm going to answer it, but also answer it with the caveat that media changes so much and so fast. For instance, just a couple weeks",

So yeah, I appreciate that question. I'm going to answer it, but also answer it with the caveat that media changes so much and so fast. For instance, just a couple weeks ago, TechCrunch decided they no longer accept op-eds, which is... It's actually huge news for us, because we love doing op-eds in TechCrunch, and so things change all the time, but I will talk about it in its current state. So yes, TechCrunch, a go-to for a lot of funding announcements. A go-to for some product news, too, even sometimes.\n\n(00:18:15):\nI would say the areas where they don't have dedicated beat reporters, where we tend to end up not working with them, are health tech-related companies and even MarTech, too. We've struggled to find the right folks to cover those kinds of stories. So not everything, but generally, if you do your digging, you're able to find a relevant beat reporter or a couple of relevant beat reporters, and it's not just about getting coverage there. They have TechCrunch Disrupt, you can apply for speaking at that conference, and that sometimes actually directly turns into coverage. They have The Found Podcast, which interviews founders, and so if you have a really compelling founder story or topical founder story, that can be an excellent avenue to go as well. They have The Equity Pod, which is investment advice, so it's not just thinking about getting that one funding story with them, there are other ways to work with TechCrunch.\n\n(00:19:02):\nAnd I actually have heard really great feedback from clients on TechCrunch driving website traffic, the day of the announcement, especially... I haven't really been able to pinpoint when that does or doesn't happen. I'm trying to figure out if there's trends among that, but I have... Clients have sent me screenshots from the day of the announcement and they've seen a nice pickup from TechCrunch, so I think a lot of that comes down to the fact that they don't have a paywall, but their stuff tends to do really well. So it's a great spot, especially for that first piece on your company. Axios is really strong on the FinTech side, on the healthcare side, they have some really great beat reporters. The one thing I'll say about them is they're very deals-focused, so 100% would need to either have funding. If you're announcing a partnership that has a monetary component, that they would cover that. An acquisition they would consider covering, but they're not going to be... You should never pitch them on a product announcement.\n\n(00:19:58):\nAnd I think they might just get annoyed. There's a couple exceptions, a couple of the reporters might have little columns where they feature product-related things, but that's just not their bread and butter. And actually, Axios recently launched, or I guess has been launching over the past year or so, local editions. So they're really branching into local news, and so that can actually be a really nice way to get an Axios hit if you have a region-specific story. So I highly recommend checking that out. Another publication that we work with a bunch is Business Insider. If you struggle to pitch your funding story but really want it out in the world, they are big on the pitch deck stories. Those are a little controversial. Some founders, they're like, \"This is not what I want my story to be about, I do not want to share my pitch deck.\"\n\n(00:20:44):\nBut if you are in the camp of... You're open to that and you can redact, it does not need to have all the financials, it does not need to have the growth metrics, that can be a really great way to get a piece of coverage on your business. And the way that I explain it to clients is you're just getting all your core messages out there in a very direct way. You're sharing exactly what you shared with investors, that's not necessarily a bad thing. And sometimes clients will put in some customer slides, too, and so you can really make it a little bit more like what you're looking for. So yes, if you're looking for a funding story, TechCrunch passed, others passed, that's a good option. They also are huge on the entrepreneurial journey pieces, similar to the CNBC article that you got, but they really want metrics, they really push for metrics, so how much you're making, how much you're spending.\n\n(00:21:35):\nThey love those kinds of stories, so it's not necessarily about how much you raise, but for people that have really built a business. And then the last thing for Business Insider, they do a bunch of these lists of top startups, of top professionals in the field. We love doing those, they're generally a really light list, and they put out a call for submissions. Takes five minutes and it's a way to get into Business Insider. There's so many of them, it's become a joke within my newsletter, because every week, there's five more and it's the most obscure different categories. Like top sports marketing professionals helping TikTok stars. I don't know, it's always a very niche ask, but those could be really great. Then a couple more.\n\n(00:22:16):\nVentureBeat is huge for AI news. We pitch them all the time for any client that we work with that is building AI capabilities, has a new offering related to AI, perfect publication for that. Fast Company is perfect for anything related to future of work, how people work. Really great for design, media, I would say perfect for any",

Fast Company is perfect for anything related to future of work, how people work. Really great for design, media, I would say perfect for any company that fits in those categories. They're also really open to op-eds, especially with leadership advice in them. And last but not least, on the list of ones that we work with most often, I would say is Forbes. Especially on the award side, they have the FinTech 50, AI 50, Forbes Under 30, all of that. And you're not going to get a feature with one of their main reporters until you're a bit further along, but they do have that really strong contributor network, which is much... A lower bar in what they'll accept, in a way. They're more open to covering earlier stage companies, so that's worth checking out, too. So those are my top ones, I'll stop there.\n\nLenny (00:23:15):\nThat's amazing. And those are the most commonly requested and the ones you mostly go after?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:23:20):\nYeah, they're the most realistic for most startups. There are ones like The Verge, and they're a little more gadget-focused and just areas that we don't necessarily touch, but could be good for some companies as well.\n\nLenny (00:23:33):\nGot it, and then... I was going to say this for later, but there's obviously New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Thoughts on going after those?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:23:42):\nYeah, we do get those questions all the time. I would say it comes up on calls with founders, \"I want one out of every five.\" And really, when you look at... I make a joke sometimes like, \"If you want those, just have a crisis and they'll write about it.\" Fire your CEO or do really intense layoffs and have some regulatory issue.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:24:00):\nPlayoffs and have some regulatory issue and you'll get a story there.\n\nLenny (00:24:04):\nUber got a lot of stories there.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:24:06):\nYeah, I can show some examples there. When you look at earlier stage companies that are getting coverage in those publications, that's what's happening.\n\n(00:24:13):\nNow, let's say you're a tiny bit further along and you're series B, series C, maybe even series C, and you're looking for coverage in those publications, there's a couple criteria that they're always going to want if it's to write a feature on your company. One is your valuation, so that needs to be something that you're sharing on the record. Two is your hard business metrics, usually revenue, sometimes something else. And so oftentimes they'll tell founders that and immediately they're like, \"Oh, well we're not sharing that.\" So I'm like, \"Okay, well that's kind of the end of the conversation.\" Sometimes it can be shared on background, but as a general rule, you're expected to share that sort of thing. So that's kind of a nonstarter a lot of times.\n\n(00:24:51):\nI totally think it makes sense to build relationships with the relevant beat reporters and ideally shoot for... When I say build relationships, I just mean shoot for an intro meeting on behalf of the clients, or they can reach out directly with those kinds of reporters, but they're just not going to write a feature on your company. If anything, you are going to be one or two sentences in a larger story of something that they're writing about. And yeah, that's just the nature of their coverage.\n\n(00:25:16):\nAnd then when you look at something like CNBC, they're targeting people that want to learn about public markets. And so if you're not a public company, they have their CNBC Disruptor 50 list, which is focused on companies that will soon be at that stage, but it's not going to be a place for early stage companies.\n\nLenny (00:25:32):\nWhen I have these pieces in past company and CNBC, it was such a weird experience where I chat with them for half an hour and then it just comes out, and I have no idea what they're going to write about. Could be a complete tear down of everything I'm doing and you have no idea. How do you help try to avoid that sort of story? I know you have no control. Obviously reporters can write what they want to write about. Do you have any advice for how to avoid them writing something really negative about you?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:25:58):\nGenerally, if it's something that you're being briefed in advance, unless it is around something negative that's going on, it's just not their intention, it's just not going to happen. But what is a bigger issue is it not being the angle or the messaging that the company wants. And so part of that, there's absolutely nothing that we can do. Reporters are not our employees. We're not paying them to write these pieces. They have to maintain their editorial integrity.\n\n(00:26:25):\nAnd so I consider it my job to educate the founders and spokespeople that we work with that we cannot change anything the story says. What we can do is correct any factual inaccuracies, and we do that all the time. If something is factually wrong, we can get it replaced. But if they don't like that they were called, put in a category of software that they don't identify with, that's not something that we can fix",

But if they don't like that they were called, put in a category of software that they don't identify with, that's not something that we can fix.\n\n(00:26:50):\nAnother thing that you can do though to prevent that from happening is just really ensuring that the spokesperson before talking to the reporter is going to nail the messages that they want. The more that you can reiterate over and over again how you want the article to be, I think the more likely that it'll land in the reporter's head and make sure that the reporter really understands what you're building and what your goals are. And all you can do is really use the briefing and the materials that you provide to kind of sway and influence, but there's not much beyond that.\n\nLenny (00:27:20):\nSo we've talked about all these publications. These are ones to consider going after. You also mentioned podcasts and awards as something people go after. Is there a tip you could share of how to find aligned podcasts or awards, like how you find a list of here we should go after these?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:27:35):\nWe use Google. We just use search engines basically for finding everything. And the way that we go about it is first figuring out who their customers are and what vertical they're in, and then just doing searches for podcasts that are within that vertical.\n\n(00:27:48):\nBut it's not as easy as just reaching out to the ones that pop up first. The next step is a qualitative analysis. First of all, do they have vendor CEOs or vendor executives on their show? Let's say your product is sold to product managers. Maybe they only have product managers on the show. So instead you don't put the CEO forward and you put the right spokesperson-\n\nLenny (00:28:11):\nWho could that be? What podcast might that be referring to?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:28:12):\nYeah, right? But this could be for CFOs. So let's say you sell into CFOs. Don't pitch your CEO for that podcast. Get a CFO and then pitch your CFO for that podcast. I'm very for companies hiring folks, or hiring so the roles that they sell into, it helps us a lot. So if your audience is a CFO, it really helps if you have a CFO. If your audience is a CMO, it really helps if you have a CMO, and that actually when your earlier stage isn't always the case, and so it's a lot harder to pitch. So I think that's the second part of the qualitative analysis.\n\n(00:28:48):\nThe third is, podcasts really come and go, make sure... It sounds obvious, but make sure it's one that's actively producing. When you Google ones, half of them are not going to be active podcasts. And then the third is actually listening to at least part of one episode, making sure the quality is high, making sure it's the kind of thing you even want to associate yourself with. And then just looking at who the past guests are, is that the kind of peers that you want to associate yourself with?\n\n(00:29:14):\nAnd then one other thing that you can do is just in conversations with customers, find out what they're listening to, find out what they're watching, find out their media diet. And it doesn't have to be a big crazy survey that you send to your entire customer base. It can be casual. If you're farther along, it's great if you can make that a more formal sort of process, but it doesn't necessarily need to be.\n\n(00:29:33):\nAnd then in terms of reaching out, I highly recommend figuring out who the host is, just doing the research, figuring out who the host is, and then just sending them a casual note. I'm a big fan of just reaching out on LinkedIn and saying, \"Hey, love the show. Are you open to guest ideas?\" I don't even mention the client or anything, just opening the door. I just feel like that's so much more approachable and friendly than starting with a big pitch. And I think so many people start with this very long email introducing themselves or going really deep and you don't have to do that. And especially because maybe only one out of every 10 replies, it'll also save you a lot of time if you just start with something really lightweight.\n\nLenny (00:30:15):\nI think that actually works really well. That's what I find is if it's a simple little message, I'm like, yeah, let me know what you got in mind. Even though 99% of the time it doesn't work out, sometimes it works out great. And so I find, sure, let's just see what you got. And then usually I'm just like, \"Nope, sorry, not a fit.\"\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:30:28):\nAnd you get the reply that way. If you send the initial pitch and the reporter or podcast host isn't interested, chances are they won't reply. But if you just start with something friendly and they reply, they'll feel like, I guess a little more of a connection there, and so at least you'll get an answer. Whereas otherwise, you might not get an answer at all.\n\nLenny (00:30:48):\nOn the survey piece I think that's a great idea, and I've seen a few of my sponsors do this where they ask their customers, what podcast do you listen to? What newsletters do you read? Which is such a simple idea, but I",

Whereas otherwise, you might not get an answer at all.\n\nLenny (00:30:48):\nOn the survey piece I think that's a great idea, and I've seen a few of my sponsors do this where they ask their customers, what podcast do you listen to? What newsletters do you read? Which is such a simple idea, but I think people don't do that. And just from that you could figure out, okay, here's the podcast we got to get on. Here's the newsletters we want to run after.\n\n(00:31:06):\nI want to talk about how to actually pitch well. But before that, we've been talking a bit about who to reach out to and how to do that. So there's a few questions here. It's just like how important is it to have a warm connection to a reporter? If you don't have that, what's the best way to reach out to them? Is it LinkedIn, is it Twitter DMs, something else? What advice do you have about, just before we get into the structure of the pitch, figuring out who to pitch and then how to get to that advice?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:31:34):\nWho are your relationships question comes up on a lot of our calls with founders as well. I'd like to pose the question to you. Did we have a relationship before this?\n\nLenny (00:31:43):\nNope.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:31:44):\nExactly. I'm of the belief that it does not matter as much as many people think it does. And I explained this on calls where they ask, \"Oh, tell me about your Rolodex, or who is your relationships with?\" First of all, media's changing so fast. So sure, maybe there is a reporter that we worked with recently. They might have a completely different beat in six months. They might be at a very different publication. So it's not sustainable to build an entire career on having relationships with certain publications.\n\n(00:32:17):\nAnd media is changing too. Now, podcasts and Substack and newsletters, it is just changing too fast. And so I think cold outreach done well is just as effective. The only thing that a relationship will get you is an open and an answer. And so any good reporter is not going to be making their editorial decisions based on who their friends are. That's just not the nature. It shouldn't be the nature of the industry, and it's not. Maybe it'll get you an intro coffee, but that's about it. It's not going to get you coverage. They're not going to cover your news because there's a relationship there. I think the much harder and more important part is being good at writing really thoughtful notes to the right people.\n\n(00:32:57):\nAnd in a way, now we do have a relationship, and so it can come from a cold email, but now it's easier for me to pitch you because you know my name and we've spoken and we've worked together. And so for me, I'm a big fan of being helpful to reporters, and I tend to just keep it professional and pitch them on stories. I don't necessarily feel like going to drinks or having coffee all the time is crucial to building those relationships. A lot of the reporters that I work with regularly, I've never met in person, and that's okay, but it can be great for getting answers I would say. That's where the relationships can be helpful.\n\n(00:33:35):\nAnd then once you have worked with a reporter on a story, it's true that maybe they'll be more likely to come back when they're working on something related, use you as a source, quote you in articles that are relevant. So once there's something there, that's great and you should totally nurture it, but it's not all about calling in favors.\n\nLenny (00:33:52):\nAwesome. Okay. And then in terms of how to reach reporters, what do you find most effective?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:33:59):\nYeah, I'm pro all platform approach. So sometimes reporters will tweet that they're working on a story about something, and rather than me sending them an email with my pitch, I'll say, \"Hey, 10 words on why this person is the person you should talk to,\" and then send a link to an article on them and that's my entire pitch. And honestly, it's sometimes more effective than when I spend 30 minutes writing a really thoughtful email. So I'm a fan of that. I'm a fan of DMs, short, concise, direct DMs. Sometimes LinkedIn, although for whatever reason I feel like that works better with on the podcast side with hosts.\n\n(00:34:38):\nAnd then of course email, we totally email. When I email a reporter, I love to make the subject line just as clear as possible as what the goal is and why I'm emailing them. And so let's say it's for a recurring column that they have, I'll put the name of that column and the person that I think should be included in the subject line. And even that for a reporter, it's like, oh, they actually know. They actually know I write this column and they're suggesting a guest for this column. It's so direct, it's so clear.\n\n(00:35:06):\nI think just saying what your intentions are right away. Are you trying to get a Q&A? Are you trying to get a story? Are you trying to get a funding story, like I mentioned before, is very crucial, and keeping it short. I would say my most successful pitches are three sentences and anytime... Sometimes it needs to be longer than that, and generally I feel like my pitch is weaker for that reason. Attention spans are",

Are you trying to get a funding story, like I mentioned before, is very crucial, and keeping it short. I would say my most successful pitches are three sentences and anytime... Sometimes it needs to be longer than that, and generally I feel like my pitch is weaker for that reason. Attention spans are short, and so the more concise you can make it, the better. And then just sometimes I'll start with one platform. I'll start with an email and that doesn't work, so I'll go somewhere else. But I try to make it very human and respectful. So using language like, \"Hey, I know your inbox is probably slammed. Sorry to annoy. Trying you one more time here.\"\n\n(00:35:49):\nAnother thing that actually can work really well is pointing out gaps in their coverage too, and talking about things that they should be talking about. Like, Hey, my client's noticing this trend. I know you've covered it from this point of view, but no one's talking about it from this point of view. That can be really helpful because it shows that you are actually paying attention to what they are writing, but in a way that you're demonstrating that you have some critical thinking going on, not just, I liked your article on X, which is a common practice that PR people use is I like this, and then jump to your pitch. So yeah, giving it a little more thoughtful, pointing out gaps in coverage.\n\n(00:36:25):\nAnd then the last piece is, especially if you don't have hard news that you're pitching, having something pretty controversial to say.\n\n(00:36:33):\nSo we work with a lot of AI companies. If nine of them have one stance on something happening in the field and one has the other stance, chances are that one is going to be the one that a reporter wants to talk to because they are getting so many pitches on this topic, but they want to write a balanced article, they need that opposing view. And so we really push our clients to have something unique and different and bold to say. And it obviously has to be a strategic decision for the business. You don't want to go commenting on regulatory things if it sounds like you don't want to necessarily be a part of that conversation, but there are I think instances where it can make a lot of sense to say something that's a little bit bold and controversial.\n\nLenny (00:37:15):\nThat last piece is really interesting. Is there an example that comes to mind where you had a controversial contrarian pitch?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:37:23):\nYeah, so we work with a company called Clockwise, which essentially manages your calendar and allows time for focus time within your workday. They move things around for you. And a couple of months ago, Shopify got tons of positive press for essentially canceling all their recurring meetings, and everyone was very intrigued by this strategy. Press was generally quite positive towards it, and so we knew that if we just wrote another piece saying, \"Oh, this is great,\" no one would want to publish that. It had been said in a million different ways. So we looked at the topic a little more critically and we're like, okay, is this actually enough to change meeting culture within a business? And we kind of identified all these other things that we think need to happen in order to really change the culture in a way that's going to be sustainable and long-term versus just blanket deleting of calendar meetings.\n\n(00:38:14):\nAnd so we ended up turning this into an op-ed, so something that together we wrote and then pitched a publication. And yeah, the title was \"Shopify's Meeting Cost Calculator Does Not Address the Issue of Wasted Time\". And so it wasn't necessarily saying it was a horrible idea, but it was putting a little bit more of a critical eye towards it. And Fast Company was interested in the idea and they posted the piece by the CEO, Matt Martin, and it was a great thing for us to comment on. And so yeah, I think it doesn't necessarily need to be something where you're coming out against it, but just proposing something that's a little more thoughtful on the topic.\n\nLenny (00:38:53):\nJust hearing that it sounds like such an obvious thing to do. Basically a reporter is looking for an interesting story to write about. If you tell them something interesting that they could put out, that's a win-win for everybody. So makes a ton of sense. Let me try to summarize the advice you've shared so far when you're, say DMing a reporter, your advice so far is basically be very direct. Just tell them, \"Hey, I'm looking for...\" What's an example of being direct? Is it like I'm looking for a story on this fundraising announcement?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:39:19):\nI wouldn't say I'm looking for. I don't know, just I would say if it was a DM, I would say, \"Reaching out from X company. Would love to offer you the launch story alongside their funding if you're open to it.\" And usually I'd either say the amount and the investors or the company name. If you give them both, you're kind of just giving them the story and they could run with it right away. That's actually an important distinction. And so you could either say, \"Reaching out with this Martech company that's raised 8 million from X Investors. Really interesting approach, they're taking on X incumbent. Do you want the exclusive?\" That's kind of how I would phrase it.\n\nLenny (00:39:59):\nOkay, awesome. Then, try to keep it to three sentences. And you're saying sometimes when you go",

And you're saying sometimes when you go longer, you actually end up backfiring each time. Sometimes include a link to a story they've written or some other story about the company that might give them some context. Is that right?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:40:15):\nYeah. And a caveat on that is, if a competing publication just wrote a bigger similar feature on that, they're not going to want to see that. And so I would use that strategically. If it's a piece from a while ago on a different topic that does share a lot of info, I'll include it, but I'm not necessarily going to include something that might seem like why would I cover this when this was just written about.\n\nLenny (00:40:37):\nGood point. You also talked about how try to acknowledge their inbox is probably slammed, and this is taking some time maybe in follow-ups, especially like, Hey, I realize your inbox is slammed, just thought I'd come back to this. Then you talk about this idea of identifying gaps in the writing, like, Hey, it seems like you cover Gen AI. There's this trend that we've been noticing that maybe it would be interesting to cover. And then something controversial or something a little contrarian that would get them. Oh yeah, this could be a really interesting story.\n\n(00:41:08):\nAwesome.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:41:08):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:41:09):\nIs there anything else broadly in terms of pitch advice to get the attention of a reporter that comes to mind? And I know this is a lifetime of experience and it's hard to summarize all of it, but anything else?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:41:24):\nWell, one topic, maybe this would be covered elsewhere, but one topic I think is talking about incumbents that this company is taking on. So a lot of companies want to position themselves as category creators, and I actually hate that. It doesn't work. It doesn't land with press, and most of the time it's not totally true.\n\n(00:41:46):\nAnd so instead, it's actually really great when you can talk about how you are doing what X household name does, but better for X reasons, and that works so well. I'll put that in subject lines. I'll put company taking on whatever Salesforce with X approach. It's so successful because instantly it gives the reporter a frame of reference. And so it gives the reporter, oh, I know what Salesforce does, so I can understand how this solution would be better. And a lot of companies really want to position themselves as the first to do anything in a certain space. They love the idea of category creating, creating these little marketing phrases that they use for the new category. And that's fine if perhaps that works on the sales side, but on the PR side, I would never have put that in a pitch.\n\nLenny (00:42:35):\nThere's just going to be a meta comment, but the two topics that are most controversial in this podcast that I have both sides of opinions on is the power of category creation and jobs to be done.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:42:48):\nOh, really?\n\nLenny (00:42:49):\nThere's a lot of passion on both sides.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:42:52):\nI mean, sure, you can point to examples of the two companies that have done category creation well, but it's two out of what, thousands?\n\nLenny (00:43:06):\nI love it. I'm going to keep poking this hornet's nest. I love it. Okay. But you're saying in your experience doesn't work when pitching reporters?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:43:10):\nFor PR. Yeah, simply for PR. In other areas of the business I can't comment on, but for PR, it's just not a useful tactic.\n\nLenny (00:43:18):\nOkay, awesome. This episode is brought to you by Vanta.

So thank you for doing the homework. Let's pull them up and then I'd love to just show people what you find has been really effective and works great about these examples and then what somebody could have done better, whatever you want to share about that example.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:44:35):\nSure. Sounds good. I guess since we're on the topic of category creating versus not category creating, I'll start with an example that's very relevant to that. So we worked with RAMP in their very early days",

Sounds good. I guess since we're on the topic of category creating versus not category creating, I'll start with an example that's very relevant to that. So we worked with RAMP in their very early days, and one of their first product announcements that we did together was the launch of their bill pay offering. And so at the time, I think they were like a three billion dollar company, something along those lines. So big, but not as big as they are today. Product news rarely gets big feature coverage, especially for something along the lines of a bill pay offering for B2B companies.\n\n(00:45:09):\nAnd so essentially the way that we framed the story was how RAMP was now able to take on Bill.com, which at the time I'm not sure if it still is, was one of the best performing FinTech IPOs public company that really had still only captured two percent of this market overall. And so by positioning it as allowing them to take on this massive incumbent that was getting a lot of press, we actually were able to get a CNBC story on the launch of this product. Generally they won't even consider product stories, but they really liked the angle of this underdog doing something that could take on a piece of market share from them.\n\n(00:45:47):\nAnd the next day there was actually another story about how Bill.com stock had gone down and they did make mention of RAMP's news in that story. So it ended up really just, it was a very powerful way of telling the narrative there.\n\n(00:46:02):\nAnd another way, if we hadn't pitched it like that would've just been RAMP brings simple, seamless, streamlined ability to do vendor payments and new finance offering, first of its kind. All these things that might be how you would talk in your customer emails, but if I had pitched it that way, probably wouldn't have been a story. So if we had pitched it as them creating a new category of this all in one software, which I mean, yeah, it could be argued, that's another way to tell the story. I don't think CNBC would've been interested.\n\nLenny (00:46:34):\nAwesome.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:46:36):\nSo, okay, another example, we work with a company called Column Tax, which is embedded tax filing software. So essentially they work with other FinTech's to allow people to file their taxes within the tools that they already use. And last year they partnered with a company called Propel that offers SNAP benefits. So essentially for low income families to receive the government benefits to offer tax filing directly within the app that they've created.\n\n(00:47:04):\nAnd that was one thing that they were doing amidst many other customers, that they had lots of different threads we could pull on with them, but we decided to really just focus our press strategy on that one initiative because it allowed us to tell macro story about TurboTax had to pay all these fines for practices that many considered unsavory around calling themselves free but not really being free. The IRS is building a free filing system, but it's in its very early days.\n\n(00:47:35):\nSo the fact that they were having this offering that was supporting a lot of low income families, and I believe 40% of the people that filed their taxes with Column hadn't filed taxes in the previous year, so hadn't gotten a return. It's like identifying the piece of the story that's most interesting and then doubling down on that. So we were able to get a great fast company piece instead of pitching this macro here are Column Tax's latest growth metrics, and they're announcing a partnership with Propel. And so it's like...\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:48:00):\nGrowth metrics, and they're announcing a partnership with Propeller. And so it's figuring out how to tie it to these things that people actually care about, and not just the company's messaging I think is our job.\n\nLenny (00:48:12):\nAmazing, is there any other examples? Otherwise, I'll share your pitch of someone coming on my podcast, and what worked about that.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:48:20):\nI do want to share one more, because it's my favorite. I want to share my favorite funding story that I worked on. And so I'm actually going to pull it up, because this one is very graphic, in terms of how we went about showing the product. So we worked with a company called Gamma, which is essentially bringing a PowerPoint into something that's much more modern, and interactive, and usable. So when we did their launch, they were a seed stage company, we tried to get really creative with how we could display or talk about the company. And so instead of doing your standard company blog posts, we actually made a Gamma presentation, and we kind of included all these fun elements that made it really interesting to reporters. So firstly, it's a visual platform. So we created... Or actually I don't want to take credit for this. The Gamma team created this great visual.\n\n(00:49:11):\nAnd we kept it very to the point. Every year, half a billion people create presentations in Google Slides and PowerPoint. We're not using marketing language here, we're talking in a very direct way, we're including fund visuals. We talk about Gamma's mission, pretty short, this is not a long essay on why the company exists. And then we include some customer love, so they're early stage, so we didn't really have necessarily growth metrics that we wanted to share. So we tried to make",

We talk about Gamma's mission, pretty short, this is not a long essay on why the company exists. And then we include some customer love, so they're early stage, so we didn't really have necessarily growth metrics that we wanted to share. So we tried to make it a little bit more personal, and focus on actual users and what they're saying, while also showing the product capability here. And then instead of doing a long thing on each investor, we just bulleted who the investors are, which is very to the point, easy for a reporter to repurpose.\n\n(00:49:55):\nAnd then the fun part that I really loved, is we did a video from the lead investor talking about why she invested, instead of including an investor quote. So it's a little bit different than what you expect. And their videos are fun, because they have all these interactive elements. And yeah, team photo, make it a little more personal. And that was about it. But anyways, it was a very successful story, and I believe the title of the TechCrunch article that we got as a result was Gamma Brings PowerPoint into the 21st Century. Exactly, that's exactly what we're talking. Maybe they are creating a new category, we weren't talking about it then, we're talking about how it's better than the existing solutions. And so yeah, I guess the piece of advice there, is feel free to get kind of fun and creative with it, and don't just follow the typical issuing press release format.\n\nLenny (00:50:42):\nAnd is that something we could link to for people to check out? Is that just on their site?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:50:42):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:50:42):\nOkay, amazing.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:50:46):\nYeah, I actually had to for some reason do some digging to get it. But yeah, I have it now, so I can give it to you.\n\nLenny (00:50:52):\nOkay, great. And the way that you use that is when you sent emails or DMs to reporters, you included this link?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:50:58):\nAfter they had that they're potentially interested, because again, if I had shared it right off the bat, it would be their prerogative to just publish it essentially or share it publicly. And I guess one important note, is everything you say to a reporter in an email is on the record, and so that's why I make the point on not sharing the entire story right off the bat.\n\nLenny (00:51:19):\nGot it. So many companies won't have... They're not a deck product, so they can't do something like this. But the takeaways for other folks here, is be just very human in the language, the investors are just bullet points, make it fun, add some visuals, don't just have blurbs, and paragraphs, and things like that.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:51:41):\nYeah. I think reporters are used to getting the same thing all the time, and so this one obviously worked well for the format. But I think we try to always think of, what can we do that's slightly different for this one? Or how can we make this a little more fun? I guess the one exception, if the product is very technical, and you have a very technical audience, and you're probably going to work with a very technical reporter, it's totally fine to talk to your audience in those cases, and you don't need to necessarily dumb it down so everyone can understand. But that doesn't mean... I mean, you can do that while still using clear and concise language.\n\nLenny (00:52:18):\nOkay, so let me share the element of the pitch that you sent me, that convinced me to bring this guest on. So this is going to be the chief product officer at NewBank. I barely know anything about NewBank. And so in your email to me, you basically had just two bullet points, and the way you put is, \"Two fun facts about NewBank, growth has been 80 to 90% organic because of the way they try to make customers fanatical about the product.\" And to me that's like, \"Wow, that's very rare, is 80, 90% of your growth being organic.\" So to me is like, \"That's an interesting story.\" And then the other tidbit is, \"NewBank is bigger than Coinbase, Robinhood, Affirm, SoFi, and Lemonade combined. Seriously, so much bigger than people in the US realize.\" Which I 100% did not realize. So to me both were just like, \"Okay, this is an interesting story to tell, I think people would be very curious to hear how a company like this operates.\" So now I'm going to start getting all these emails from people, all these couple bullet points.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:53:15):\nThey're going to combine a bunch of companies, and see which they're bigger than.\n\nLenny (00:53:19):\nYeah, or use AI to help them figure this out. But I think what you identified here is just what I get excited about. Is there any advice there of just what you did there that other people can learn from?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:53:32):\nYeah. I mean, I think with pitching you, speaking to the audience, it's not just about having... You don't want the most well-known CEOs all the time, you're not looking just for the biggest companies and the most well-known",

Is there any advice there of just what you did there that other people can learn from?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:53:32):\nYeah. I mean, I think with pitching you, speaking to the audience, it's not just about having... You don't want the most well-known CEOs all the time, you're not looking just for the biggest companies and the most well-known people. You're looking for the things that they can talk about, and how the things that they can talk about are relevant to your audience. And with the first bullet, it was indexing on that. The second bullet was more so like, \"Hey, you might not know about this company.\" And it's a little bit of a unique one, I wouldn't necessarily always include that. But to me the first bullet was really what mattered, because it wasn't just about the fact that they were a huge company, it's that they grew in a unique way, and I knew that was the kind of thing that you'd be interested in.\n\nLenny (00:54:13):\nAnd how did you figure that out? Is it from emails we were exchanging ahead of that? Is it listening to some podcasts? How did you get to those conclusions?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:54:21):\nYeah, listening certainly helps. But I do think just figuring out... If you even just scrolled the names of all the episodes that you've done, it would be pretty easy to spot a trend there. And so you're not talking about product launches, you are not talking about entrepreneurial journeys, you're talking about tactical lessons. And so pitching people based on those sort of things, I don't even think you necessarily need to listen to a whole bunch of episodes most of the time, maybe occasionally you want to gut check something before you reach out. But yeah, you can tell a lot just by doing a little bit of research.\n\n(00:54:53):\nAnd then we did have a little back and forth, because I will take responsibility, I did try pitching you on a CEO at one point, which I know you don't have on as guests.\n\nLenny (00:55:03):\nOnce in a while, very rarely.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:55:08):\nYeah, actually, there's obviously some exceptions. But I had known the subject matter you were looking for, but I did not spot the trend that you've never had CEOs on. So I think my pitch was actually okay, but the spokesperson was not the kind of person that you would want on. So maybe you won't get it right 100% of the time, but you can tell a lot just by doing some searches.\n\nLenny (00:55:24):\nAnd oftentimes I just reply, \"Here's my policy.\" And then, \"Okay, good to know.\" Kind of along these lines, something I wanted to ask earlier, you mentioned a few publications to go after, and then how to pitch people. Obviously the way that you're describing takes a bunch of time. How many people are you often emailing, DMing per attempt to get a story? Because it sounds like it's not a ton, and so you have time to do these sorts of custom pitches. Or is it a lot higher than it sounds?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:55:51):\nI would say for hard news, funding, the startup launch, those sort of things, less, and I try to really stagger it because we're offering exclusives, and I highly recommend offering exclusives. So the worst thing that can happen is two reporters reply, and are both interested, and you have to go back to one and say, \"Nevermind.\" And sometimes that's okay if they left you, if it's been a week or something, they hadn't gotten back, and they'll understand. So it's fine to move on without getting an answer. So I would say, yeah, with the funding story, it could be anywhere from one to six reporters on average, sometimes more. With stuff like general just outreach, relationship building, trying to get on podcasts, it kind of is a numbers game, and you really have to balance quality and quantity.\n\n(00:56:38):\nAnd that's why I love starting with the first note and not saying much, and just saying, \"Hey, you open to guest ideas?\" Because it allows you to do more. I'd rather do that than send a bad pitch, and not have it be targeted to the right sort of audience. And so that's kind of a way to play the numbers game while still being respectful. But yeah, I mean, with some clients maybe they get one opportunity for every 20 or 30 things that we send. And so yeah, we try not to do... We don't do blasting media, it's not about sending the same pitch to a single list of people. It's figuring out, which ones do I want to really double down on because they're the perfect target? And you'll keep trying, you'll be really custom, which deserve maybe a slightly higher level note, which deserve a DM, and just figuring out your strategy from that.\n\nLenny (00:57:27):\nAwesome, okay. Do you have examples of pitches, announcements that were not as effective as they could have been, and advice for how they could have been better?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:57:37):\nYeah, I have some excerpts that I pulled from press releases where I think there's room for improvement. So Lenny, I want to read one to you, and then I want to see if you can tell me what this company does. Okay, \"Today X announced their workflow automation product, which combines AI assistance, human in the loop collaboration, and a robust multiplayer experience to help teams save time.\"\n\nLenny (00:58:03",

Okay, \"Today X announced their workflow automation product, which combines AI assistance, human in the loop collaboration, and a robust multiplayer experience to help teams save time.\"\n\nLenny (00:58:03):\nAbsolutely no idea what's going on.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:58:05):\nYou kind of gained something from workflow automation, and then after that it's like, \"Wait, what?\"\n\nLenny (00:58:05):\nJust a bunch of things.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:58:10):\nOkay, now let me read to an excerpt from the TechCrunch article, and this is how TechCrunch positioned it, \"A new automation startup is setting out to eat Zapier's lunch. It helps people tackle mundane and repetitive tasks, and goes beyond the triggers and actions popularized by similar platforms like Zapier.\" So to me, yeah, it's a better version of Zapier, where they aren't just doing triggers and actions, and there's a little more substance and depth to it. If you know what Zapier is, you can kind of start to figure out what they do based on that.\n\nLenny (00:58:41):\nYeah, it comes back to your point about referencing incumbent to help you understand what the heck you're talking about\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:58:47):\nAnd you wouldn't necessarily need to do that in your press release, but I think they could have been a lot clearer, and not use... Because terms like robust multiplayer experience, that makes it sound like a game. Are we talking about just collaborative multiple users? Human in the loop collaboration, isn't all collaboration between humans, and we're all in the loop? AI assistance, that just means they use AI. So yeah, sometimes I push my clients to like, \"Okay, let's talk through what each of these phrases actually means. And if you can't articulate it, then let's change it to the way that you just articulated it, and it might be more successful.\" So yeah, that's a good way to do it. And just read it out loud, read it out loud and see if someone understands it.\n\nLenny (00:59:34):\nSomeone hearing this is like, \"How could possibly anybody think that was great? How did these come about, these really bad descriptions?\" I know it's hard to come up with something really short and pithy, but where do these come from?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:59:49):\nIt's just a culture within marketing and comms, of this is how we're supposed to write. And I just think that's a majority of how people do it, and they think it sounds smart, or they think it sounds more professional. I just think it's just how people are trained. And so even when we bring on someone new, part of my job is stripping away at a lot of that, and getting people... Everyone's capable of talking like a human being, we do it every day. But it's stripping away that thing that goes off in your head that you're supposed to be writing in a very marketingy way. Because I would say at least 50% of releases are like that, it's not a small problem.\n\nLenny (01:00:30):\nRight. I love the advice you shared of just trying to say it out loud, hearing yourself, what does it sound like? Do you have any other tips for trying to make it something people get and connect to? I know that, again, it takes a lot of time to really do well and it's very context specific, but is there any other tricks that you find help you communicate what you're actually offering?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:00:48):\nIt's talking through the basic questions, what does this product do? Who is it for? Who are your customers? If you can answer each of those in one sentence... What product launch are we talking about here? If you can just answer each of those verbally, chances are you're not going to be far away from what you're looking for. Because when I talk to marketers, and founders, and teams, generally in the conversations I have no trouble understanding what they're talking about. They can articulate it just fine, it's only in the writing that it gets that way. So actually I think it's kind of easier to solve than many might realize. And then also I think there is some skill involved in removing words, not over explaining, you can make things more concise. But at the bare minimum, just strip out all the jargon, that's the first step.\n\nLenny (01:01:36):\nI love it. So one way to think about it is, just think about, what does it do? Who is it for? Who are the customers? Is there something else along those lines that you shared there as a bullet point?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:01:45):\nWell, I mean, if you're talking about what makes this business interesting? Why should people care? And not over indexing on that. I think that's just one part of the overall story, is why people should care about this business. And then what's new? Is it growth metrics? Is it the customer piece? Is it product? What makes this timely and relevant right now?\n\nLenny (01:02:08):\nOkay, awesome. There's actually this awesome Twitter thread from a couple of days ago, where the CEO of Product Hunt did this thread where he asked people, \"Share your tagline, and I will give you a much better version of the tagline.\" And he's really good at this. So I'm going to link to it in the show",

There's actually this awesome Twitter thread from a couple of days ago, where the CEO of Product Hunt did this thread where he asked people, \"Share your tagline, and I will give you a much better version of the tagline.\" And he's really good at this. So I'm going to link to it in the show notes, where he can give you an example of what it looks like from bad to good.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:02:26):\nI love that. That's exactly the kind of thing I would love to do too, because it's so fun and so easy.\n\nLenny (01:02:33):\nIt's easy if you're good at it, most people are not great at it. You mentioned press release in this example, you shared thoughts on value of press release, traditional press release versus not.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:02:44):\nPress releases came about because reporters would be checking news wires for ideas of what stories they want to write. No reporters do that anymore, or a very small percentage, I don't know any reporters that do that anymore. So now it's this thing where you go to one of the PR distribution services, you pay them anywhere between 300 to $2,000, that's literally what it costs, and they put it on the wire. And for the more expensive services, it does get syndicated to this press release section of some business websites. No one, in my opinion, goes there for their news. I've personally never read an article, like a Yahoo Finance article, that was a press release syndication. So in that sense, they are not helpful for getting eyeballs. They also require... Going back to that more marketing form of writing, they require that you write like that.\n\n(01:03:39):\nThe standard press release format, it's so formulaic, and I think it actually encourages that more marketing speak. The benefit is that you're getting all the news details in one place, so it's relevant for a reporter. However, you can do the exact same thing in a blog post. And the blog post can be this first person piece of content that's written by either the founder, or the product lead, or whatever executive, that has a lot more flexibility in the style. You can kind of write it however you want, it can still include all the same news elements. And it's much more shareable on social, you're not going to share a link to a press release on your Twitter or on your LinkedIn, but a blog, for sure. You can add your own graphics, it's great.\n\n(01:04:21):\nAnd you're also encouraging people to go to something that lives on your website versus this black hole of a newsletter. I should be fair, so I think that the reason that people say that they still do them, is that it helps with SEO. However, I've read a few articles that have said that Google no longer does prioritize press releases in SEO, so I don't know how much that holds up. And that it signals to the market that the company is more serious, so that's a perception thing. I personally think that blogs actually signal a more modern, kind of cool company than a press release. But at a certain stage in your growth, public companies, they do press releases for earnings, makes 100% sense. There are certain rules around when companies do need to issue press releases, so there's still a use case for them, I just think your average early to mid-stage startup doesn't need them.\n\nLenny (01:05:10):\nThis mention of blogs is where I wanted to go next actually, so it's a good segue. But before we do that, is there any other examples that you wanted to share of less than ideal ways of pitching a product?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:05:21):\nOne sentence I found in a press release that a lot of companies want to include that I always try to remove is... Well here, I'll give you the sentence, \"Since exiting stealth in May, we've witnessed a 700% increase in organizations using our product.\" You're saying that since you were in stealth to now you saw a 700% increase, so you could have had one customer, now you have seven. And it's every company wants to do these percentage growth stats when they just launched, and I've never seen reporters include that in their stories.\n\n(01:05:50):\nAnd so there are ways to give signals of how fast you're growing without being that kind of disingenuous. One way that you could put something similar is, \"Our revenue hit six figures at the end of last year, and has been growing about 30% each quarter, with 40% of adoption coming from the enterprise sector.\" So you're giving color to the growth, and you can kind of play with that, it doesn't need to be exactly something like that. But if you can make it a little more specific, I'm not against doing percentages, but I think there's a way to balance that with something that seems a little more realistic.\n\nLenny (01:06:25):\nOr, \"We went from zero to six figures in ARR in X months.\"\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:06:29):\nYeah, no, totally. And it doesn't need to be huge, especially if you're doing your first story, they're not expecting that you're necessarily going to have massive revenue. And so I think founders might sometimes be concerned that it's not going to seem big enough or significant enough, whereas from working with a lot of companies, it's kind of the case across the board.\n\nLenny (01:06:49):\nYou mentioned a bunch of amazing companies, you've worked with Ramp, Perplexity, a few others.",

And people may feel like, of course you're getting pressed, those are amazing. Ramp grew to a 100 million AR in two years, Perplexity is this killer AI product, everyone's talking about AI. Most products are not that, they don't have as interesting of a story to tell. Is there either an example you could share of a company that didn't have an amazing story to tell, that you created an interesting story out of? Or just any advice for, how do you help find something that is a nugget that gets people excited?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:07:23):\nSo some of the examples I gave, so Clockwise and Column Tax aren't as big as some of the other brands I mentioned. So that's certainly actually the bulk of our business, I would say 80% of the companies we work with are at a stage where they haven't reached that kind of mass awareness yet.\n\n(01:07:40):\nAnother really great company that we work with is Entropy. And so essentially they work with transaction data, they're an API. It's a very technical tool, it's not something that necessarily every reporter is going to instantly understand. But for them, we've actually really leaned into the founder story. She's this incredible woman who moved to the US, and actually struggled with getting her first apartment here because of the way that our credit scoring system is set up. And one of the use cases for what she's building actually directly relates to how our credit system could change in the future, and so we've been really leaning into that angle. And her personal story is really powerful. And so maybe sometimes the product isn't going to be something that you can easily pitch, but you can kind of find those other personal angles in or pull on certain threads.\n\nLenny (01:08:33):\nAnd there it connects back to find the publication that cares about these sorts of personal stories, because TechCrunch probably won't.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:08:40):\nYeah. But she spoke at Money20/20, so it's useful for speaking abstracts too. Actually it was on a panel with Column Tax, we got them on together at Money20/20.\n\nLenny (01:08:52):\nWhat a win.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:08:56):\nNo, and we love doing that, it's so fun when you do have multiple companies that you can connect. Actually, that's kind of a good macro point as well. It doesn't always need to just be about you, if you have an idea for a conference session, reaching out to colleagues that you've worked with at other companies, peers, people that are building other things that maybe don't compete better in a similar space, and packaging that up as like, \"Hey, this could be a really strong panel.\" It's actually way more successful than just pitching yourself.\n\nLenny (01:09:24):\nAwesome, okay. So you've mentioned a couple of times the rise of newsletters and podcasts. So there's kind of two buckets of questions here. One is going after these kind of non-traditional media platforms, and then the other is building your own following, and building a following on Twitter, for example. I know you worked closely with the CEO of Vox who's really good at this, and basically doesn't need press. Elon is amazing at this, maybe that's why he bought Twitter, he has this huge platform to talk about all the stuff. So maybe in the first bucket, talking about when you're trying to decide, should I go after traditional media, Vox, and VentureBeat, and Axios, and all these guys? Versus I'm going to go for newsletters. As an example, Ramp got a lot of benefit from Not Boring, that newsletter with Packy, who wrote about them constantly and loved it. And they're sponsored posts, and organic posts. So I guess the question there is just, how do you think about going after podcasts, newsletters, Twitter, LinkedIn, influencery platformy people versus traditional press?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:10:31):\nI think of newsletters and podcasts actually in the camp of, if we're pitching traditional press, we're 100% pitching those. Social is its own ball game, but I would not leave out newsletters and podcasts from any core PR strategy. To me, it's now just a part of any PR program that we're going to run, because it's just part of media now. And to me, it's just a very important part of media. In terms of social, I think doing social well is very hard. So you gave Aaron from Vox as an example, that was all 100% him. I think I helped with one tweet once about a Microsoft partnership that we did, and I was so excited.\n\nLenny (01:11:10):\nHow did it do?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:11:11):\nActually really good. A publication ended up writing a story on the tweet about Microsoft and Vox partnership because of it. Yeah, so that was fun. But generally it's not always something that you can just turn on by hiring an agency. And I've seen many companies try doing that, and not necessarily see as much success as they'd hoped for. So if a founder is naturally good at that stuff, lean into it as much as humanly possible, go for it. If they're not, and you're trying to outsource it, it can be done to some success.",

So if a founder is naturally good at that stuff, lean into it as much as humanly possible, go for it. If they're not, and you're trying to outsource it, it can be done to some success. But I don't necessarily think it's as easy as just posting three times a week on relevant topics, there has to be more going on there. I think that if the spokesperson or the executive that you're trying to build the presence of is willing to... Going back to what I said earlier, kind of push the limit.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:12:00):\n... Presence of is willing to, going back to what I said earlier, push the limit on opinions that they have, be bold, be controversial, then it could be worth potentially investing in. And I have seen it play out where reporters have seen those posts and used and quoted things in their articles as a result, so it can tie to your traditional media strategy a little bit, they're not necessarily fully siloed, but I would say if you're considering investing in social to just do corporate channels and not think about executives, you're really leaving a lot on the table. Corporate channels, it's very hard to build a following.\n\n(01:12:39):\nTo get someone to follow a brand and care about a brand, you have to be bringing something new to the table, because they don't want to read your latest blog post, they don't want to read a relevant article that your social person just decided to put out there. When you have an executive, you're following a personality, you're following a person, ideally there's more flexibility with tone, all of that sort of stuff. And so I think it's important to think about it from the people perspective and not just the brand perspective.\n\nLenny (01:13:07):\nSo just to make it clear, the CEO or some execs should be the people tweeting and LinkedIn, and not the company as a brand?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:13:17):\nYeah. And I don't know. I think that it can be a little industry specific as well for where it makes sense to be investing in the corporate channels. And you certainly can do that sort of thing. But I also think if you're going to do that, have an exec that you're also trying a social strategy with. Don't just do the plain corporate channels.\n\nLenny (01:13:36):\nWhen I think of a brand doing this really well, it's Duolingo. They're just so hilarious and so ridiculous in there. And I don't know if the key is just funny is the way to go, and that's how you get any attention, but they're so funny and creative in their videos, especially TikTok.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:13:50):\nIt's interesting though, we're getting to the point where even brands having a personality on social is becoming its own meme. People are making fun of how all the fast food brands all are like these Gen Z like TikTok-\n\nLenny (01:13:59):\nAnd they're all replying to each other on Twitter threads.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:14:02):\nYeah. And so things change quickly. So, yes, that was a good strategy, but you just have to stay on top of it.\n\nLenny (01:14:11):\nSo you talked about how if this comes naturally to you as a founder, obviously do it. I'm guessing for most people it doesn't. Do you find that it can work if you're just like, \"I know this is important, I need to tweet often and share things,\" have you seen that work or is it just like it's just probably not going to be something that works great for you?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:14:31):\nYeah, I think it can work to some extent. Maybe you're not going to necessarily be going viral or getting hundreds or tens of thousands of followers. But for me personally I push myself to post on LinkedIn at least once a month, because every time I post we get at least one client inbound and maybe a candidate inbound. And so if you test it and you start to see value, push yourself to do it even if it doesn't come naturally. And that's, I guess, the nice thing about social is it's easy to test out. You can try doing it, you can post for a while, even for a month or two, see how it's going, and then adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\n(01:15:06):\nBut, yes, I think for a lot of execs that we work with, it does feel like it's something that's really hard, there's a lot of overthinking, making sure it's right. You can get really in your head about it, and I totally understand that because I feel the same way. And so if it's taking up so much of your time and bandwidth just thinking about your social strategy, then I guess you can weigh if it makes sense to do that, but I think pushing yourself to try it is a great idea.\n\nLenny (01:15:31):\nAnd then Aaron specifically is very good at this, is there anything that you learned from his approach to tweeting specifically? I don't know if he uses other platforms. That works really well for him.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:15:42):\nI actually think I just learned so much. So it was my first in-house job, so I had worked in an agency, I hadn't worked internally at a company before, and I think I just learned so much about comms best practices from him in general, just even beyond social. He was so good at figuring",

So it was my first in-house job, so I had worked in an agency, I hadn't worked internally at a company before, and I think I just learned so much about comms best practices from him in general, just even beyond social. He was so good at figuring out how to comment on things happening in the news, having just the right stance that was both interesting to the reporter but not necessarily threatening to the business, and just capitalizing on all those moments. And I just watched how that worked and I was like, \"This is how good PR is.\" And it's like the space that they're in is not necessarily one that reporters are all writing about, but he was able to insert himself in those conversations really well. And I think also at the time that I was there at least just really valued press and was willing to put the time in and do the briefings.\n\n(01:16:34):\nAnd so just getting to hear how he speaks over and over again was really helpful. And then on Twitter, I think it clearly just comes naturally to him, and so it wasn't necessarily something that needed to... Like I mentioned, how some execs will spend all this time thinking through to the point where it could get in the way of other things. I think that's not the case there. And if anything, it just helped the business. And actually with his Twitter presence, I would say it's a good example too of stuff getting included in articles, like I mentioned in that Microsoft article. So it helps the PR strategy as well.\n\nLenny (01:17:10):\nAmazing. And we'll link to his Twitter account. This is Aaron, CEO of Box, by the way. I think I mentioned at the beginning and then we just started talking about Aaron. Also, I realize, he tweets about this sometimes, he actually makes money from Twitter, and now the Twitter pays you for views and things and they share ads, he makes thousands of dollars also from X now, by the way, not Twitter.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:17:29):\nThat's so funny.\n\nLenny (01:17:30):\nYeah, it's pretty ridiculous. I think I've gone through every question that I had for you. I'm curious if there's anything else that you think might be helpful to share or cover or leave listeners with.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:17:43):\nI can leave with one very tactical media opportunity that I love.\n\nLenny (01:17:51):\nAmazing.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:17:52):\nOkay, so here it is. It's a way to get a morning brew feature pretty somewhat easily. So they have this series called Morning Brew Coworking series, and they have it for Emerging Tech Brew, they have it for HR Brew, all their verticals. I think there's a CFO one, marketing one. And essentially if you go to the series, the coworking series, either at the top or the bottom, there's something where it's like, \"If you want to be featured, click on this link and fill out this form,\" and it's about 10 questions. If you keep your answers interesting and fun and not too self-promotional, we've had, I would say, 50% success rate with getting execs featured that way. And all you have to do is submit through a Google form. And it's just one of my favorite media opportunities right now. It doesn't need to be CEO, actually probably shouldn't be a CEO in a lot of instances, but it's basically intended to help readers understand what the day-to-day looks in certain jobs and just get a little insight into the people that are in these jobs. And so I guess I just wanted to share that as something that you could do today for over 10 minutes and potentially get a story. Although, maybe not after you post this, so we'll see if they get an influx.\n\nLenny (01:19:03):\nWe're going to take down Mailbrew. Funny enough, they have an interview with Zuck today that they published on Morning Brew, so it could be you alongside Zuck.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:19:10):\nThere you go, yeah.\n\nLenny (01:19:13):\nMaybe before we get to our very exciting lightning round, it might be fun to chat about how to pick a PR agency. Obviously you run one. When people are trying to decide who to work with and also when to decide to pick and work with a PR agency versus doing it themselves, what advice can you share when they're trying to make that big decision?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:19:33):\nI think there's an assumption that bigger, more well-known agencies are going to do a better job. I think a lot of those bigger, well-known agencies are used to working with a lot of household brands. And so their strategies tend to be very reactive, focus in the messaging, maybe have to turn down a bunch of opportunities, control what people say. That is the polar opposite in my opinion of doing startup PR. Startup PR, you got to experiment, you got to try new things, you got to be scrappy, you got to be fast. We actually personally love diving into pitching right away rather than spending several months on messaging just testing and market right away. And so don't assume just because they have the huge logos... To your point, you're like, \"Oh, well, you work with [inaudible 01:20:16] Perplexity, does that mean you know how to work with all these tiny companies?\"\n\n(01:20:19):\nThat's not necessarily a good thing, so don't",

I would say that's my first piece of advice. My second piece of advice is find out what month one looks like with them. If month one is them just doing intake calls and learning about the company, and you're a startup that's still really paying close attention to how much money you're spending, you're not going to necessarily want to partner with an agency that needs a three-month ramp up cycle. And so really tactically understand what those first few months look like. I think that's something that I've noticed is a lot of agencies take a while before they get their hands dirty and start doing things. My third piece of advice would be writing recent writing samples. To the point of all those press release excerpts I shared, is that how they write? If it is, maybe they're not the right agency. So ask them. That's so easy. That's so easy to do.\n\n(01:21:14):\nJust ask them for a couple recent blogs or releases, whatever they tend to go for, and read those. And, of course, wins too. You want to see what kind of stories they're getting, but that's a little more obvious. A lot of people have already talked about this, so I'll just mention briefly, it's important to meet with the actual team you're working on, not just the founder of the agency. So asking who's our day-to-day going to be? Can we chat with them really quick? One thing I would say don't do is an extensive RFP process. We actually as an agency don't participate in RFPs. The two times I've done it, I have regretted it just because of the amount of work going in versus the value that's there. And it's you're asking a team to do a lot of free work for you, and generally I think the best players are not going to do that, so you're going to weed out some of the best players if you're asking them to do a lot of free upfront work. So those are a few considerations.\n\nLenny (01:22:06):\nPerfect. And then just two more questions, because I imagine this is what people are thinking about when they're trying to decide should we find somebody is how long ahead of time they should find someone before something big is happening? And then just what's a budget they should have in mind for something like this? What's a minimum or a range, whatever you think would be helpful for people to understand here's how much you're probably going to be investing here?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:22:27):\nStart times can vary from agency to agency. I think we can get started the week that a client needs us to, so maybe I'm not best equipped to answer this, but I would say before an announcement happens, you probably want to kick off six weeks in advance. So when we start with the company, it's like we're working on the blog, we're doing a media training, we're doing the media outreach, we're getting quotes from investors, or coordinating with all the parties, making sure images are being created so it's not just pitching and securing the article. So I would say buffer with time to pitch, make sure that the reporter is actually able to cover it. Six weeks is ideal. I would also note I highly recommend not having a firm date that you think you need to announce something and going instead with when a reporter is able to cover your story.\n\n(01:23:12):\nWe get so many clients that come to us and they have this set date in their head, but there's not usually a real reason for it. It's like they're planning around it, it's like they have other comms they want to go out that day, but if you can optimize for the reporter over the timing, you're going to see such a better outcome because getting the first choice reporter is going to drive way more for your business than announcing it four days sooner. So leaving a little bit of flexibility for that agency is key. And I've even seen companies like issue a press release for big news with no coverage because they had stuck to a certain day and were very rigid about it, and they didn't get any stories for that reason. And so I think a good agency would counsel to offer that flexibility.\n\n(01:23:54):\nSo six weeks I think is the ideal amount of time. And then budget, I would say the lowest end would probably be about 10K a month for an agency. You can find consultants, I think the best ones would be at least 8K a month, but for a small boutique agency starts at 10. I'll just be transparent, I'm very open about our pricing, our rates start at 15K a month for our retainers, and actually that's for a series A companies generally what they're at. And then I would say unless you are a global business that needs basically different teams for different product lines, which happens when you're a Microsoft of the world, that's another story. But if you're just a series C startup that's getting a lot of attention, I wouldn't go beyond 30K probably. There are plenty of agencies that go into the 50s and 60s a month, but that's just a whole nother world, and I'm not an expert on that part.\n\nLenny (01:24:56):\nAmazing. Thank you for sharing all that. What if you're going for just a one-off, just help me get one story, what's a range there for",

Emilie, is there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:25:19):\nNo. I'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:25:20):\nWell, welcome to our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions. Are you ready?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:25:25):\nI am.\n\nLenny (01:25:26):\nFirst question, what are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:25:32):\nI have one that's very top of mind right now, so it's How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan. Actually, I leave tonight for a week long psilocybin retreat.\n\nLenny (01:25:46):\nWe should have done this... N [inaudible 01:25:48]\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:25:52):\nI know. I would be getting much more philosophical maybe.\n\nLenny (01:25:53):\nWow.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:25:56):\nSo very excited, I'm going to Jamaica.\n\nLenny (01:25:58):\nAmazing.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:26:00):\nAnd ever since researching that field, there's the whole concept of changing your neural pathways is just very fascinating to me. And just opening up and shifting perspectives is something that I think will actually help me a lot just even in running a company, being a better leader, I think we're at a stage in our growth right now where we're hiring a lot and there's a lot of pressure and I just want to make sure I'm bringing my best self forward every day. And so I'm really excited about it.\n\nLenny (01:26:27):\nWhat an amazing answer. This is going to be part of your set and setting this interview, but hopefully you can get it out of your mind.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:26:34):\nNo, totally. I was nervous. I'm like, \"It's actually really great that this is happening and then I can completely unplug after it. And so I think it's actually good timing.\n\nLenny (01:26:34):\nI'm excited to hear how it goes.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:26:45):\nI'm not a big book recommender. I have ADHD and reading full books is very hard for me, and so I'm just going to leave you with that one. I can do the occasional beach read I'll really focus, but it's not my main format of content consumption.\n\nLenny (01:27:01):\nAmazing. All right, great answer. One's plenty. Do you have a favorite movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:27:08):\nMy favorite genre is post-apocalyptic, end of the world survival. I need to mention my all time favorite show, because it would be bad not to. So Walking Dead is my comfort TV show, I can watch it when I'm going to sleep at night, but my most recent favorite was Yellowjackets. Are you familiar?\n\nLenny (01:27:30):\nI've seen the poster on my TV, but I've not watched it.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:27:35):\nNice. I discovered it a little late. I think the second season finished and they're working on the third. But it has plane crash, and it has just shocking moment after shocking moment like cannibalism, very weird stuff. And it's one of those shows that sticks in your mind, which I like where you're thinking about it afterwards. It's kind of creepy.\n\nLenny (01:27:59):\nWow. I thought you were going for Last of Us, but I now have to watch this show.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:28:05):\nNo, I watched Last of Us and I didn't feel like it had enough survival elements to it. It was like storytelling in that environment, but it wasn't actually a survival post-apocalyptic show in the way that I was looking for.\n\nLenny (01:28:17):\nHardcore. Do you have a favorite interview question you like to ask? And you could take this in any direction you want.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:28:25):\nYeah. I have a new one. We actually just revamped our interview process, so I wanted to make it harder. So my new favorite question is if a client comes to you and they're convinced they have something that's press worthy, like an announcement that they think should be, I don't know, in the Wall Street Journal or something, and you know for a fact that it isn't, what steps do you take? What do you do next? And I like that question because they can handle it, one, from the client relations standpoint, how do you communicate with the client when they say something like that, but it's also a critical thinking and creativity question of how do you take a no and turn it into a yes? How do you take what they're giving you and make it into something interesting? And so I like to dig into",

How do you take what they're giving you and make it into something interesting? And so I like to dig into that, and they can use a real example if they want, but I also think a lot of our job is pushing back in a way. And so that also shows if they're able and willing to push back.\n\nLenny (01:29:17):\nI'm so curious to hear people's answer to that. Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you love?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:29:24):\nI was very skeptical of Apple Vision Pro and I was making fun of it at the beginning, and the first time I tried it, I completely changed my tune, I'm so into it, I'm ordering one, and I'm very excited for actually using it for work. I think it could be a really good use case for just my day-to-day at work. After I had tried it, the next day I messaged a bunch of clients that I thought could have relevant applications for it. I'm like, \"Do we have an Apple Vision Pro strategy? Are we billing to talk about it publicly yet?\" Because sometimes it's tying back to the PR conversation, I love if you're willing to push the envelope on stuff that you are building or are going to do and getting ahead of those conversations, so that's a lot of conversations I'm having right now is trying to convince clients to talk about that.\n\nLenny (01:30:10):\nSo you have an Apple Vision Pro strategy, amazing.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:30:13):\nAnd then my other one, which is very self-serving, because they are a client, but I do use them every day, is Perplexity. I find it so helpful even just for like I'm working on an award submission, I forgot how much funding a client has raised, asking them that instead of opening five different Google links and trying to find the answer, it's just huge for quick information. Or writing a bio for an executive, getting just the TLDR of what they've done in their past, it's so good for PR use cases, and I actually think marketing and PR is going to be one of the core work applications for them.\n\nLenny (01:30:52):\nI've also already shared how much I love Perplexity, I have the Chrome extension installed. I probably use it at least once a day for podcast interview prep along with a bunch of other stuff. So good find for customer. I think they're going to do great. Wish I was an investor.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:31:07):\nI'm the happy investor. I rarely angel invest and I was...\n\nLenny (01:31:12):\nDrinks on Emilie someday.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:31:15):\nThere we go.\n\nLenny (01:31:16):\nThat's awesome. Good job.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:31:18):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (01:31:18):\nOkay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family, either in work or in life?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:31:26):\nStrong opinions loosely held, I'm a very opinionated trust my gut kind of person, but that doesn't mean I'm not willing to change my mind on things and be wrong. I first heard it from an influencer [inaudible 01:31:38] and then I Googled it, and apparently... What was it? Jeff Bezos also said it at one point, so I have no idea the origin of the quote, but I think that's a good one. You can still be really opinionated in life, but that doesn't mean you always are going to be right.\n\nLenny (01:31:52):\nEmilie, this was everything I hoped it would be. I feel like this is going to help so many people get awesome press. Thank you again so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you and reach out if they want to learn more or work with you? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:32:06):\nOur website is sixeastern.com and our email is hello@sixeastern.com, so you can find us there. And actually I have a newsletter called On Background. It's on Substack. And really what it's intended to be is a place for people to find these tactical opportunities, so it has media moves, it has reporters that are working on stories, it has awards that are open, all of this stuff that basically an intern in an agency would spend their days researching we put into a newsletter. And so its main audience is PR people, but I actually think it could be a great resource for people within companies that don't have PR teams to stay on top of stuff. So I guess to be helpful, feel free to subscribe. And then other than that, we're hiring, so if you happen to be a PR person that got this far in the episode, always looking for great people to bring on.\n\nLenny (01:32:57):\nAmazing. Is there anything specific you're looking for in people you're hiring for people that may want to reach out other than they've been in PR?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:33:02):\nIdeally some B2B experience. I think doing B2B PR is very different from doing consumer PR. If you work with startups, that's a huge plus",

Is there anything specific you're looking for in people you're hiring for people that may want to reach out other than they've been in PR?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:33:02):\nIdeally some B2B experience. I think doing B2B PR is very different from doing consumer PR. If you work with startups, that's a huge plus, you know how to be kind of scrappy and fast. And also people that just love to be really hands-on and doing the actual work. We're very flat, so we're not a place where there's much managing of teams. So it's really much more like a consultancy than anything else.\n\nLenny (01:33:24):\nAmazing. Emilie, thank you so much for being here.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:33:27):\nYeah, it was so fun.

What the labs need is labor marketplace. They actually need extraordinary professionals that can measure model capabilities.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:17):\nThey found this pocket, maybe the biggest business opportunity in history.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:00:20):\nWe grew from 1 to 400 million in revenue run rate in 16 months, fastest ascent in history.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):\nWhy is this so valuable?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:00:29):\nThe market is bound by the amount of things where humans can do something that models can't. The lab's primary bottleneck to improve models is how they can effectively have some way of measuring what success looks like for the model.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):\nThere's this tweet that you retweeted. \"If you really think about it, we were put on Earth to create reinforcement learning training data for labs.\"\n\nBrendan Foody (00:00:49):\nIt's highly likely that the entire economy will become an aural environment machine, building out all of these worlds and contexts. And I think the narrative in AI over the last three years has almost entirely been one of job displacement, but very few companies and people have talked about this new category of jobs that's being created.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:08):\nI talked to a lot of people about what should I be studying? Where should I be getting better?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:01:12):\nHow can they leverage this technology to do so much more? We'll give people interviews where we say, \"Use whatever tools are available to build a website and let's see what product you're able to build in an hour.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:24):\nToday, my guest is Brendan Foody, CEO and co-founder of Mercor. Mercor is the fastest-growing company in history to go from 1 to $500 million in revenue. They did this in 17 months, less than a year and a half. Brendan is also the youngest unicorn founder ever. They just raised $100 million at $2 billion valuation. Mercor, if you haven't heard of them, helps AI labs and AI companies hire experts to help them train their models using AI. They've never had a customer churn, their net retention is over 1,600%, and they're on a nine-figure revenue run rate.\n\n(00:01:59):\nIn our conversation, we talk about the increasing value and importance of evals, the landscape of AI training companies like Mercor, and why they've become so important and valuable, how Brendan discovered this opportunity, his insights on what product market fit looks like, the core tenets he's instilled within his organization that have allowed him to build the fastest growing company in history, what people writing evals for labs are actually doing day to day, which skills and jobs are going to last the longest with the rise of AI, why he doesn't think we'll see AGI or superintelligence anytime soon, and so much more.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:05:45):\nThank you so much for having me, Lenny. I'm a huge fan, and so excited to have a conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):\nI'm really excited to have this conversation as well. I'm a huge fan of yours. I'm excited for more people to learn about you and what you're building.\n\n(00:05:57):\nI want to start with a tweet that you have pinned at the top of your Twitter feed right now, and here's the tweet. \"We are now working with six out of the Magnificent 7, all of the top five AI labs, most of the AI application layer companies. One trend is common across every customer. We are entering the era of evals.\"\n\n(00:06:19):\nThe reason this caught my attention is that's one of the most recurring trends on this podcast, people talking about the increasing value of learning how to do evals well and the value of evals for companies. It feels like still people don't know what the hell this is what we're talking about, why this is so important. Talk about just what you think people are still missing, what they need to know, what this era of evals means.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:06:39):\nIf the model is the product, then the eval is the product requirement document. And the way that researchers' day-to-day looks is that they'll run dozens of experiments where they'll make small improvements on an eval set. And reinforcement learning is becoming so effective that once they have an eval, they can help climb it. If you look at just how fast people were able to saturate Olympiad Math once they focused on it, how fast we're even saturating SWE-bench once we focus on it. And so in many ways, the barrier to applying agents the entire economy to automate every workflow is how do we measure success? How do we eval it? And write the PRDs for everything that we want agents to do, which Mercor is obviously a huge part of doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:25):\nSo people hearing this, they're like, \"Oh, yeah. Okay, shit. I got to really pay attention to this eval stuff.\" Any advice about learning how to do this well? What companies that are doing this well are doing differently? Help people get better at this thing.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:07:39):\nYeah. I think that for enterprises especially, the core way to think about it is how can they build a test or systematic way to measure how well AI automates their core value chain? So if it's an architecture firm that's producing these architecture diagrams of what they provide to their end customer, how can they effectively measure that? And each company has its own value chain or maybe a handful of them if it's a multi-product company. And just thinking about how they measure that is the prerequisite to really effectively applying AI throughout their entire business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:21):\nI saw you talking about this on the No Priors podcast with Sarah and Elad, and I don't know if it was after this or before this, but Sarah tweeted, \"Evals equals your new marketing.\" What does that mean? What do you think she's saying there?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:08:32):\nYeah. Well, it ties to what I said earlier about how if the model is the product, evals are the PRD, but also subsequently the sales collateral, right? Because evals are what you give to researchers to show them what they should be building and going on, but they're also the way that you demonstrate the efficacy of capabilities.\n\n(00:08:51):\nAnd historically, everyone's been pointing to these academic evals of PhD level reasoning with GPQA, Humanity's Last Exam, or Olympiad Math, but now it's moving towards the capabilities that people practically care about of how do we get models to automate the way that we build a software platform or automate the way that we do an investment banking analysis. And I think labs as well as application layer companies will increasingly use evals to demonstrate the capabilities of their models and their products.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:26):\nOkay. So let's build on this and zoom out a little bit and talk about the landscape of the market that you're in. And I",

So let's build on this and zoom out a little bit and talk about the landscape of the market that you're in. And I was just reflecting on this as I was preparing for this conversation. If you think about the companies growing faster than any company's ever grown in history, there's essentially three buckets. There's the foundational model companies, there's vibe coding apps, Cursor and Loveable and Bolt and Replit and all these here, and then there's data labeling data companies like you. So I've had the CEO of Handshake on the podcast. I have the CEO of Scale coming on. There's also Surge. There's you guys. Help us just understand the landscape of what this is all about because I think people don't really know what the hell's going on and see all these companies growing like crazy.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:10:06):\nYeah, I'll give a little bit of the origin story, incorporate in that and how it frames the landscape. Because when we started the company, I met my co-founders when we were 14 years old. We started the company together when we were 19 initially, in January 2023, initially hiring people internationally, matching them with our friends and automating all the processes of how we did that. So similar to how a human would review a resume, conduct an interview, and decided to hire. We automated all of those processes with LLMs, bootstrap the company to a million dollar revenue run rate before we dropped out of college.\n\n(00:10:40):\nAnd then a handful of other things happened, but we met OpenAI and we saw that there was this enormous transition in the human data market where it was moving away from this crowdsourcing problem of how do you find low and medium skilled people that can write barely grammatically correct sentences for early versions of LLMs and moving towards this sourcing and vetting problem. How do we source and assess the best professionals, the experienced? Think software engineers, the investment bankers and doctors and lawyers that can actually help to evaluate and interpret all of the capabilities that people want models to have.\n\n(00:11:21):\nSo from there, we start working with all of the top AI labs. We grew from 1 to 400 million in revenue run rate in 16 months, and it's been an extraordinary journey and super exciting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:36):\nOkay. First of all, that is out of control. I don't know if people understand. I think this is the first time you're sharing that number. I know we're recording this, you'll have announced it by now, but 1 to 400 million in revenue in 16 months.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:11:49):\nExactly. So fastest ascent in history, which is an exciting statistic we're very proud of.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):\nOkay. So something big is happening here. Why is this so valuable? What is going on here? So it's just to try to summarize what you guys do simply is you help hire people for labs to help them train their models, and you help them find not just generalist labor, but experts, helping them with very specific gaps in the model's knowledge.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:12:21):\nYeah, precisely. And so it really ties to your first question around the era of evals that's framing all of this, which is that the lab's primary bottleneck to being able to improve models is how they can effectively have some way of measuring what success looks like for the model, both to use it as the eval for the tests that they're measuring their progress against, as well as the verifiers in an RL environment to then reward the model, improve capabilities, et cetera. And they need this across every domain for every capability that models don't know how to use. And the wealthiest companies in the world are willing to spend whatever it takes to improve model capabilities where Mercor is sitting at the forefront and the primary bottleneck.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:12):\nOkay, what are these people actually doing? So what's an example of a kind of person that is sought after? And then what are they doing sitting there at the computer?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:13:19):\nEffectively, the market is bound by the amount of things where humans can do something that models can't. So I'll make that very concrete. Say you have a model that you want to write a red line for a contract in the way that a lawyer would, and it makes a handful of mistakes, misses a bunch of key points in doing so. What you could do is have a lawyer create a rubric similar to how a professor might create a rubric to create a deliverable for what are the things we want the model to be able to do?\n\n(00:13:50):\nSo it can effectively score that, right? Plus however much of it identifies this or XYZ key point. And that's really the foundation to measuring what does progress look like for models? Is this model achieving the capabilities that these professionals want? As well as how do we use this as training data to reward and to reinforce a lot of the capabilities that people want models to achieve.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:19):\nOkay, so they're essentially writing evals just to connect it back to original conversation.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:14:23):\nExactly. Well, that's an interesting thing is everyone talks about RL environment.",

Well, that's an interesting thing is everyone talks about RL environment. I feel like the two hot button things are like RL environments and evals, but one thing like Andrej Karpathy's tweeted out about a bunch is there's not actually a nuance. It's in the data type. It's more just a different semantic way of describing what it's being used for. But ultimately, it's just some stasis point for how do you measure what good looks like? And you can use that either as the benchmark to the sales collateral, as Sarah was saying, to say, here is why are models the best model in the world and here's the capabilities that we've been working towards, or you can use it on the post-training side to reward certain model trajectories and achieve those capabilities.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:08):\nOkay. So say this lawyer, this person is writing, \"Here's what a great red line contract looks like and here's the rubric of what excellent is.\" Then are they also providing data, like actual examples of red line documents as a part of that?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:15:22):\nThey may. The data landscape historically has included two kinds of data. The first is supervised fine-tuning data, which is input/output. When people think about fine-tuning in the historical sense, that's what it is. The second is RLHF where the model will generate a couple of examples. We'll choose which is the most popular example.\n\n(00:15:43):\nWhat everyone is generally moving towards is reinforcement learning from AI feedback instead of human feedback where you have instead the human defined some sort of success criteria, some way to measure that. And examples in code, it could be a unit test. We can scalably measure success and other domains that could be a rubric. And then you use that to incentivize model capabilities. And it's far more scalable and data-efficient, and so that's why a lot of the broader trend in the market across the board is moving towards RLHF to both eval models as well as improved capabilities.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:24):\nI had one of the co-founders of Anthropic on. He said exactly the same thing. That's what they've done at Anthropic, is move towards AI-driven reinforcement learning.\n\n(00:16:32):\nSo essentially, if I can understand this correctly, I'm the lay person here trying to understand this on behalf of the audience. So essentially a lawyer is like, \"Here's what correct looks like for redlining,\" and then it's AI is just on its own almost, just like, \"I'm going to try to get this. I'm going to try to improve on this and I know if I'm heading the right direction based on this eval/rubric I've been given.\"\n\nBrendan Foody (00:16:55):\nExactly. Applying all of the criteria of what good looks like similar to how the TA might apply the professor's criteria of does the student's response meet this criteria or this criteria plus however many planes, et cetera.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:10):\nAwesome, okay. Let me shift to talking about the broader labor market here. So there's two parts to this question as we talk about this. One is just how long will we need to do this? You guys grew so incredibly fast. Is there a point of like, \"Okay, we don't need humans. We're tapped out.\" So let's start there and then I'll ask a broader question.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:17:29):\nSo the key question is how long there's going to be things in the economy that humans can do that AI can't do? And I think there's certainly a bucket of people that say we're going to have superintelligence within three years and humans won't play a role in the economy. And that's one school of thought.\n\n(00:17:46):\nOur perspective is very different. Our perspective is that these models are extraordinary and automating a lot of things very quickly, but there's a lot of things that they're horrible at. Even still, it can't schedule time on my calendar. It can't draft emails for me. It can't use basic tools. And we need evals for everything. For everything that the models can't do, we need evals for the tool use, evals for the long horizon reasoning.\n\n(00:18:12):\nImagine in 10 years when we want models to be able to go out and build a startup for 30 days. We need evals for that to effectively reward it. And I think that that road to improving models will last for as long as there is anything in the economy that humans can do which models can't and be a huge portion of what the future of work looks like. And so our mission is creating the future of work, and I think that this is a really exciting industry and giving us a glimpse into the direction that everything is headed towards.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:49):\nThere's this tweet that you retweeted that I want to ask you about. \"If you really think about it, we were put on Earth to create reinforcement learning training data for labs.\"\n\nBrendan Foody (00:18:59):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:00):\nWhat does that mean to you? What is this person implying? And it's basically what you're saying is we're just helping train models.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:19",

What is this person implying? And it's basically what you're saying is we're just helping train models.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:19:06):\nIt speaks to conversations I've had with a lot of researchers and executives at top labs, which is that it's highly likely that the entire economy will become an aural environment machine, building out all of these worlds and contexts for us to then have rubrics or other kinds of verifiers. And that is really exciting in so many ways.\n\n(00:19:32):\nBecause I think let's draw an analog to other revolutions where when we had the industrial revolution, everyone was freaking out about losing their jobs, but there was this whole new class of jobs of how do we build the machines? How do we have knowledge work? How do we create everything new? And I think that the narrative in AI over the last three years has almost entirely been one of job displacement, right? Sure, there's ChatGPT is growing fast and it's very cool that everyone loves using it, but from an economic standpoint, people talking a lot about job displacement. But very few companies and people have talked about this new category of jobs that's being created and what that's going to mean and how people can prepare and upskill for that. And I think that the most exciting thing possible is creating that future of how do humans fit into the economy and how will that evolve over time?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:22):\nI talk to a lot of people about just what should I be studying? Where should I be getting better? People in school right now are just like, \"What is even going to be valuable in the future?\" You're at the center of a lot of just what jobs are most in demand, how hiring is evolving. So let me just ask you a very concrete question. What jobs do you think will remain in the future/what skills are still worth investing in for younger people, especially?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:20:47):\nIn terms of jobs, I would respond with a category of things that have very elastic demand are going to be super exciting. Because when we make people 10 times more productive, we'll build 10 times, if not 100 times as much software as an example. And so I think the product managers that can now do so much more are going to be extremely well-positioned. And so far as the skills, I think it's people that can leverage AI to do whatever their day-to-day workflows are.\n\n(00:21:16):\nI have had a couple conversations with teachers where they get my thoughts on how they should be assessing their students because we originally started out curating all of these AI interviews and assessments for people and have thought about this immensely. And what we realized is that you don't want to fight against them using the models. It's similar to when the calculator came out, you don't want to give people all of this arithmetic work of how do you get them to do it and not use the calculator. You want to tell them, \"Use the tools and let's see what you can do.\"\n\n(00:21:49):\nAnd so we'll give people interviews where we say, \"Use ChatGPT and Kodak. Use Claude code. Use whatever tool cursor and whatever tools are available to build a website and let's see what product you're able to build in an hour.\" And so I think that I give that an example in so far as talent assessment because I think it pertains also to the skills that people should be honing in on of how can they leverage this technology to do so much more in whatever industry or vertical they're operating in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:17):\nWhen you talk about elastic, being elastic, is it generalists being good at just a bunch of different things, or what do you say? What do you mean when you think elastic?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:22:25):\nSo I more mean how much capacity for demand there is in that industry. So I'll give a couple of examples. In accounting, I think realistically we only need so much accounting in the world. Maybe there's areas where we can do more and that'll be good, but it doesn't feel like the world needs 100 times more accounting.\n\n(00:22:46):\nOn the other hand, in software development, I think we can ship 100 times more features for our products, move 100 times faster, build so much more. There's just it feels like there's unlimited demand for the industry. And I think Mark Andreessen tweeted about this recently, that software is the most elastic industry of all where when we increase productivity, there's so much more that will be built. And it's definitely characteristic of a lot of other domains as well. And so I would focus on those domains where if we make everyone 10 times more productive, that'll increase demand, not reduce it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:23):\nOkay. So you're in the bucket of learn to code, still useful as a skill. You take computer science. And so in terms of elastic categories of jobs, sounds like engineering, product management is in that bucket. Great. A lot of people listening to this are PMs. What else, like design users? I don't know. What else do you feel is in that bucket from what you've seen?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:23:44):\nYeah, I think that there's a lot of things where the whole value chain of building companies has a lot of these variable costs, even large portions of",

A lot of people listening to this are PMs. What else, like design users? I don't know. What else do you feel is in that bucket from what you've seen?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:23:44):\nYeah, I think that there's a lot of things where the whole value chain of building companies has a lot of these variable costs, even large portions of operations or consulting. Imagine if we could have 10 times as many McKinsey consultants, what would be possible in so far as the research we could do, the analysis, et cetera. But I think the companies and people that are going to succeed are those that lean into this narrative of abundance of how do we do so much more rather than fighting back against it of how do we try to stop displacement.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:20):\nSo along those lines, I think about your second bucket, which is the people that will be most successful. It's not like a specific skill, but it's being good with AI, using AI to become better at what you're already doing. This reminds me of Elon's whole thing with Neuralink, which I don't know if this is how we put it, but the way I've always heard it is you wanted to build Neuralink because in the future when AGI and superintelligence is around, we need a way to compete and the best way to compete is plug our brains into a superintelligence so we have a chance. And it feels like that's what AI is. Getting good at AI tools is essentially is having this super superpower.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:24:58):\nFiguring out how to leverage them and incorporate it will definitely be of paramount importance.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:04):\nIt just comes back to this almost cliche quote now. It's, \"AI won't replace you. People that are really good with AI will replace you.\"\n\nBrendan Foody (00:25:10):\nI think it's totally spot on. And I've definitely seen this at the enterprise level as well where there's certain enterprises we talk to that are almost fearful not wanting to engage, not wanting to eval their businesses because that'll provide the evidence that their value chain is being automated. And there's others that... Literally some of the most recognized sophisticated Fortune 500 businesses that have this mentality and there's others that are leaning into it of if we have the ability to do 10 or 100 times more, what will that mean and how do we lean into that future? Because there's so many things that are going to change over the next 10 years, and I think those are the kinds of businesses that are going to be successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:54):\nLet's talk about labor markets more broadly. You guys, so it's interesting though. You started not feeding people to AI labs, not training models. It was just like help people find jobs, help companies hire, and then you're like, \"Oh wow, this whole opportunity.\" You have this really interesting view on the future of just labor markets and hiring. Talk about that.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:26:14):\nYeah, it's interesting. I remember when we started the company, as I mentioned, we were 19, and just had this gut intuition that it felt so wildly inefficient that labor markets are so disaggregated. And what I mean by that is when we would hire someone internationally, they would apply to a dozen jobs. When we as a company in the Bay Area were considering candidates, we would consider a fraction of a percent of candidates that were available in the market. And the reason for that is that there was this matching problem that everyone's solving manually where they'll manually review resumes, they'll manually conduct interviews, and manually decide who to hire. But when we're able to automate that matching problem at the cost of software, it makes way for this global unified labor market that every candidate applies to and every company hires from facilitating a perfect flow of information in the economy.\n\n(00:27:08):\nAnd I think that that future is undoubtedly what we're heading towards, but what we've realized over time is that the nature of work is also changing dramatically. And part of building that future over a 10-year time horizon is creating that future of work and all of the more tactical things we do and building these incredible data sets across evals and RL environments for our customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):\nWhat I've seen in how hiring has changed, I'm doing research on this with a partner, Gnome, it's so much easier to apply for companies that everyone's just applying now, to hundreds of companies. AI is just making it easy to adjust their resumes and cover letters and make it feel like, \"Oh, I applied to more of course very specifically, but it was one of 100 places.\" And then on the flip side, hiring managers are getting flooded with applications and so now they need AI to filter. So even if we didn't want to get to this place, we're almost being pushed into this direction of so much volume on both sides. We need something really smart at filtering and helping us hire and select, and this is exactly what you guys have been building for a long time.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:28:13):\nPrecisely, yeah. And the fascinating thing a lot of people ask, do we think about ourselves as a labor marketplace or do we think about ourselves as a data company? And I think that the reason it's an interesting question is our realization on from what the labs need is that they actually need a labor marketplace. They actually need these exceptionally high caliber people. And of course we'll layer on some project management and some software platform associated with it. But the really",

But the really core thing that they want is how do they find these extraordinary professionals across all of these different domains that can measure model capabilities and work to build that future work together?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:56):\nThis episode is brought to you by Enterpret.

That's E-N-T-E-R-P-R-E-T.com/lenny.\n\n(00:29:55):\nGoing back to just how this all works and what you guys do for models, I was talking to a friend who had an ankle sprain or his foot was hurting and he got an x-ray and he fed the x-ray into ChatGPT and then asked him, \"Give me this specific x-ray.\" And it's like, \"Okay, sure.\" And then it gave him, \"Here's what you have.\" And he was talking to me, he's like, \"What is out there on the internet that trained this model to know this stuff?\" And I was like, \"No, it's actually somebody sitting there helping the model understand this. Once they recognize, it doesn't fully understand this. Humans are actually helping them learn these things.\"\n\nBrendan Foody (00:30:29):\nExactly. Well, so the way it works, at least what most people's understanding is there's a lot of complexity in how the models work, is that pre-training gets a lot of the knowledge into the model of what are all the different things that see into the world. And then post-training and reinforcement learning is for all of the reasoning of what are the pieces of knowledge that are accurate, what are inaccurate, and what to prioritize at any given time to make a decision. And so behind that, there would've been radiologists that worked on the post-training data set to create some stasis point for here's the diagnosis and rewards and penalties associated with it. And it's really the quality of those people that went into the quality of the decision and recommendation that ChatGPT ultimately made.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:14):\nSo let's actually follow that, right, because that's really interesting and I don't know how many people understand it. I understand it. So the work that you do and these experts do is post-training. It's not feeding data into the model that it's trained on. It's, \"We have this model GPT-5. Now here's all the things that's missing. Let's add to it.\"\n\nBrendan Foody (00:31:31):\nExactly, yeah. It's really unlocking, allowing the model to focus on all the right tokens, from pre-training all the right things in model context, up weighting the effective reasoning chains to enable the models to reason better in a more generalized way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):\nWhat's the scale of people just working on the stuff. It's like thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:31:53):\nTens of thousands at any given time, hundreds of thousands more generally. It's huge. And the most exciting thing is that it's growing really quickly. I think that to your question also about the competitive landscape, historically there were all these crowdsourcing companies that would get these super high volumes of low-skilled people. I think Scale and Surge were the primary companies that pioneered that industry. And then in this transition to higher-skilled labor, what people realized is that actually you can go a lot further with just getting higher caliber people even in smaller amounts initially, and now subsequently scaling that back up once they're able to meet the quality bar.\n\n(00:32:35):\nAnd I think that there's a bunch of companies that after our success and very rapid revenue growth that started early last year have chased after that, which makes sense. And seeing that the market was changing very quickly, we were taking off, and trying to pursue a similar thesis on the market.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:56):\nIt's interesting. There's always been these companies, AlphaSights and GLG, that did this before AI or is paid to connect to an expert and ask them questions about stuff. And essentially, okay, it turns out this is really useful for models. We don't need the person in the middle.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:33:11):\nExactly, yeah. Well, but one core difference is that AlphaSights would generally be a one-off call versus a lot of our work is really hiring people for projects of how do they work on something for a longer period of time. And so that's, I think, one",

Well, but one core difference is that AlphaSights would generally be a one-off call versus a lot of our work is really hiring people for projects of how do they work on something for a longer period of time. And so that's, I think, one of the reasons that some of the traditional expert networks have struggled to get into this. And also how do you retain those people and think about all the incentives where it actually looks more similar in some ways to one of the traditional labor marketplaces of an Uber or DoorDash, just with much higher-skilled talent that's treated exceptionally well?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:50):\nIt's such a good opportunity for me to learn so much about this, so I'm going to ask questions.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:33:55):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):\nIt's so interesting to me. How much of the experts are focused on specific concrete knowledge versus personality and softer skills? How much of it's like, \"Here's how you do an exam. Here's how you do an x-ray\"?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:34:09):\nIt depends on the lab. It's a lot of both. I think that previously it might've been more softer skills, but now a lot of the labs are focused on their business models of what are the economically valuable capabilities that drive revenue and leaning a lot into these professional domains. But I think the creative side is also still really important to everyone. And so we're seeing a meaningful amount of both. We hired all the people from the Harvard Lampoon a couple of months ago, their comedy club, to help with making models funnier. And so do all sorts of stuff like that, hiring Emmy award-winning screenwriters and everything across the board on creative capabilities that you'd look for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:51):\nThat is amazing. What a cool story. I'm excited for this to kick in. How fast do these things turn around? Say you hired this team, how fast are we going to see the impact potential? Is like months? Is it years?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:35:03):\nWell, so it depends, because some models or some labs will release iteratively where they'll just improve the model behind the scenes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:11):\nWithout announcing a new model?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:35:12):\nExactly. Every couple of weeks versus others do these big releases. And so it depends a lot. We're behind all of them, but we move really fast. It would be a customer gives us a request of we need these award-winning screenwriters, and within 24 hours we'll turn around the experts. And then there's also this really interesting dynamic where in a set of 100 people that we hire, oftentimes the top 10% of people will drive majority of the model improvement. It's like a company. If you have 100-person company, oftentimes the top 10% of the company will drive majority of the impact. And what that means is that when we're able to build proprietary advantages in identifying who are those top 10% of people, both in so far as how do we have them on our platform but also identify and match them effectively, it creates so much value for customers that it's difficult to compete against.\n\n(00:36:08):\nAnd so it really does tie back to the founding thesis of the company, which is how do we find these extraordinary people and identify them so that we can reliably deliver these top 10% or top 10X experiences for our customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:25):\nSo on that, so is the idea, you hire Jane. She's incredible at coding and she now works for Anthropic and that's her full-time job doing this? Or is this a part-time thing? Is this a project thing mostly?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:36:38):\nIt would sometimes be part-time. Sometimes it would be full-time. I would say most often it's part-time where it's like someone might work at a thing company where they're underemployed, maybe one of the ones that's moving slower where they have an extra 20 hours a week and then they're able to do this on the side or whatever the equivalent is across a bunch of different industries. But we also do a lot of 40 hour a week roles as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:08):\nAnd how much are they making? Is it meaningful enough for a AI engineer to spend time on this?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:37:13):\nYeah, very meaningful. So our median pay rate in the marketplace is $95 an hour, but it can flex up, well up into $500 an hour based on the depth of someone's expertise. And one thing that highlights this difference relative to a lot of the crowdsourcing companies is if you look at the economics of the crowdsourcing companies, oftentimes they would pay $30 an hour to town as the average. And so think about the people that you can hire, the undergrads for $30 now versus the Goldman bankers, the McKinsey analysts, the Fang software engineers. And ultimately it comes down to what are the capabilities that labs want their models to have? And it much more falls in the latter bucket than the former one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:02):\nI know there's only so much you can talk about with this stuff, but so Anthropic, Claude has been so good at coding so much better historically than other models.",

I also use it for writing, giving feedback on writing. What is it that allowed them to get so good at this and continue to be so good at this?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:38:19):\nWell, I can't go too much into detail about customer work, but I think that it's this trend of reinforcement learning and being very thoughtful about defining the right rewards that we're releasing across the board. And how we could mitigate reward hacking, set up the right rewards, that's super impactful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:42):\nEvals. Again, evals is all you need.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:38:44):\nBack to evals.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:45):\nYeah.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:38:45):\nOne of my favorite quotes from customers is that, \"Models are only as good as their evals,\" which has always held true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):\nI think Greg Brockman tweeted this once. \"Evals are all you need.\"\n\nBrendan Foody (00:38:56):\nYeah, truly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:58):\nLet's talk about Mercor a little bit more. One of the maybe, not even maybe, I believe the data tells us it's the fastest growing company in history.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:39:07):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:09):\nI want to understand what you did to make this happen. So let me just ask, what do you think are some of the core tenets of how you built Mercor that most contributed to being this successful?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:39:20):\nI think the most important thing is looking at the leading indicators in fast-moving markets. I remember when I used to think... Everyone in venture talks about the why now, and I used to think about the why now of how from a product standpoint, less from a market standpoint of now we can automate the way that we review resumes or the way that we conduct interviews, et cetera. But ultimately there is this legacy market that's has all these incumbents and it's relatively stagnant. But what matters a ton is actually figuring out what are the new markets, the new pockets of demand that are changing very quickly where the wealthiest customers in the world are willing to pay whatever it takes to improve model capabilities, and how do we focus on the leading indicators of those markets to make sure that we have the best solution for the flagship customers in the market and optimize everything around that.\n\n(00:40:18):\nAnd that's what I found has been most impactful in building the business. I think maybe that's one thing is leading indicators in markets. If I had to choose another, it's customer obsession. We have had for the last... We're starting to have a couple of product managers help out with go-to-market, but for the last year and a half of the business, we've had no one in sales and marketing. And so we're immature from a sales and marketing standpoint because we focused 100% of company resources on how do we build great products and experiences for our customers. Just getting word of mouth, the people that have worked with us at other businesses want to keep working with us and leaning into creating those great experiences. And so that's where I spend all my time. And I think that some founders can get caught up in how do they get really good at marketing before they've figured out the thing that really drives a lot of customer love and creates the six-star experiences that you're used to building.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:19):\nI'm going to go back to that first point, which is like, okay, you found this pocket, maybe the biggest business opportunity in history. How did you first find... What was that moment of, \"Wait, this could be really big\"?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:41:31):\nSo there's some crazy stories here. I remember we started the company as I mentioned in January 2023. And then in August 2023 when I was still in college, one of our customers introduced us to the co-founders of xAI over a Zoom call saying how we had these really smart Indian software engineers that were great at math and coding. So we met them and we explained how the software engineers we had were really good at math and coding because they weren't distracted by all the humanities. They didn't have to study history and English and all these other things, and they loved it. So they had us in two days later to the Tesla office and we met the entire xAI co-founding team except for Elon, while I was still a college student. And xAI was just getting started at that point and they were super excited about our focus on the quality of the experts.\n\n(00:42:22):\nAnd so while they were still doing pre-training, they weren't ready for human data at the time and we didn't start working with them at that point. We just knew from that point forward before we even dropped out that the market was about to change radically and we needed to be at the frontier of that. And so then fast-forward a few months, one of the crowdsourcing players came to us and actually used our platform to hire over 1,000 people where",

We just knew from that point forward before we even dropped out that the market was about to change radically and we needed to be at the frontier of that. And so then fast-forward a few months, one of the crowdsourcing players came to us and actually used our platform to hire over 1,000 people where this is very interesting experience because we started getting flooded with support tickets about how those people weren't getting paid. And we obviously felt horrible because we had referred them to this opportunity. It was this reputable company. And we realized that a lot of the incumbents were resting on their laurels with respect to what was needed in the experiences they were creating for talent in their marketplaces to help improve models. And there was this opportunity to work directly with the labs in a way that kept the dignity of the experts in the marketplace, paid them extremely well, and cut out the middlemen.\n\n(00:43:31):\nAnd so we started doing that in May of last year, and then the rest is history.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:37):\nWow, okay. Hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue since. So what I'm hearing here is you were very open to looking for poll. You saw some poll, you explored it. And then once you saw that there was something really meaningful there, you just went deep on making that an incredible experience as amazing as possible.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:43:57):\nExactly. I think if I had to distill it into advice for founders, one thing I've realized is that I spent a lot of time trying forced product-market fit. And in some ways you should be persistent. You should have these theses that you have conviction about how the world will change. But sometimes you just need to sheer it from the market and know that it's there, the poll, to know the right places to focus. Because if it's difficult to sell, if it's extremely difficult to sell the marginal customer, you're not going to be able to grow a huge business. What you actually need to find is the customer that's surprisingly easy to sell into where you're going to be able to grow with them. You know that it's a large pain point. And so it's some combination of being stubborn with respect to your thesis around how the world will change, but also very open-minded with respect to exactly what form that takes and how the market's developing and how your company will fit into it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:55):\nThat's an amazing insight. In the moments you described, felt like it was a combination of this xAI meeting feeling like, \"Oh wow, they really, really want this thing that we have. We're now doing an amazing job,\" and then it's 1,000 people hiring in the platform. Was that those two moments that are like, \"Wow\"?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:45:09):\nExactly. And those happened, keep in mind, while we were a seed company, right? Well, so the first one was before we even raised any seed funding, we were totally bootstrapped because we bootstrapped the company to a million dollar revenue run rate and have always remained super capital-efficient. We've never burned money. We were lifetime profitable. And then we raised our seed round in September from General Catalyst, and it was the other experience after we raised our seed round where we really knew that there was an enormous amount of demand in this market where we saw the volume and we saw that the incumbents were sleeping with respect to how the market was changing and the kinds of people that were needed to make that change happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:50):\nIt's one thing to see this opportunity and start to execute on it. It's another to actually succeed at this scale and consistently win. You guys have very specific values within the business. Talk about those. It feels like that's a big part of your success too.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:46:04):\nIt totally is. So I'll give the three and maybe a brief story associated with each of them.\n\n(00:46:10):\nSo the first one is having a can-do attitude, which everyone gives me a little bit of a hard time for because it's a funny saying, but we've always set these ridiculously ambitious goals, and then somehow the trajectory of the company forms around those goals. Where I remember when we were talking to Benchmark before they led our Series A, we were at 1.5 million in run rate. And I said we'd be at 50 million in run rate by the end of the year. And they said we were absolutely insane, right, as anyone would. And plus or minus two weeks, we hit it. And then we've now well blown past the tracking to 500 million in run rate, which was initially our goal for this year. So setting these incredibly ambitious goals with respect to the revenue scale of the business, the caliber of experiences for talent, all those dimensions is super important to first have a can-do attitude.\n\n(00:47:04):\nThe second thing is really high standards, which is who we hire and what we expect of them. We have an incredibly high hiring bar where we hire tons of former founders, people that have incredible experiences. We just hired or partnered with Sundeep Jain who joined us as president. He was previously the chief product officer and chief technology officer at Uber and joined our relatively small in the grand scheme of things company to help scale up all the processes where Uber is of course the largest labor marketplace in the world. So super high standards is of paramount importance.\n\n(00:47:41):\nAnd then the third one that we really lean on significantly is",

So super high standards is of paramount importance.\n\n(00:47:41):\nAnd then the third one that we really lean on significantly is intensity. And that if you look at the early cultures of the legendary companies, thinking of Meta or Google, they have these incredible, intense early-stage cultures of people just moving heaven and earth and doing whatever it takes to push the frontier of model capabilities. And so still very much output-oriented of what do people achieve rather than input-oriented of the specific hours they work, but recognizing that it takes a lot to build a legendary business, and that's ultimately what we're optimizing for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:18):\nI could see why this works. Can-do attitude plus high standards plus intensity, I could see how that leads to success. There's a lot of talk these days about this 6-9-9 culture, working six days a week, 9:00 AM to 9:00 PM. A lot of people are like, \"Why? That's terrible. Why would you make people do that?\" But at the same time, I'm just constantly hearing this from the most successful AI companies. This is just the way it is to be successful. Things are moving so fast. This is an opportunity you'll never see again. Just talk about your thoughts on that.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:48:50):\nYeah. Well, to clarify, we've never mandated hours. It's more been a byproduct of people that care a lot where we care a lot about the trajectory of the business. And so a lot of people come into the office and stay late. But if they need to leave early and get dinner with their kids or travel on the weekend, of course that's totally fine. And for us, it's much more about finding people who have a lot of ownership and are really bought in, less so about the specific hours in the office, even though we found that oftentimes it's the people that are most bought in, not always, but oftentimes it's the people that are most bought in and that burn the midnight oil with us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:30):\nWhen you say high standards, is there something you could share that gives us an example of what you mean there? Because a lot of people think they have high standards and they don't.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:49:37):\nIf you are very patient, there's always some trade-off between speed and quality when hiring. And I remember especially for our first 10 people, we were just so patient and disciplined about finding some of the best people in the world. Half of them are... Our second employee, Sid, as an example, our second employee in the US, Sid was previously the head of growth at Scale who joined us when we were a seed stage company. Daniel who joined us was previously scaled to consumer apps to over 100,000 users and all sorts of just extraordinary backgrounds of our first 10 hires. And I think that that initial talent density shaped so much of what the rest of the org looks like as you scale it up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:28):\nI know you also have this perspective that people talk about waiting to hire, to hire really slowly, but it's actually not necessarily the right advice. Talk about that.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:50:39):\nIt's painful because it's a double-edged sword. On one hand, I'm thrilled that our first 10 people are so phenomenal and I think that that has paid dividends for the business. But on the other hand, I think that companies do get to the point where you just need to hire really fast. And there's some things where you need a lot of people to do them and you need to recognize that there's going to be some variants associated with hiring, but moving quickly is the priority.\n\n(00:51:07):\nAnd I think that in some ways, we move too slowly with how we scaled out the team. And so the benefit is that everyone is extraordinary. We have this super high bar and we want to maintain that over time. But I think the downside is that while the company has grown incredibly quickly, we likely could have grown even faster if we had moved a little bit more quickly with especially ramping from call, like 10 to 100 people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:37):\nOkay, I was going to ask. So it sounds like the first 10, be very careful, take your time, 10 to 100, maybe speed up a bit.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:51:44):\nYes, though I wouldn't say it's necessarily 10. It's determined by the point where you know it's really working. And I know that's still not a bright line, but it's like once you know that there's so much more demand than you can handle, that's when you want to step on the gas and optimize for speed in a lot of ways. But I think especially until then, it's important to be patient, be disciplined. Get the best people is always important, but speed becomes more important once you find the market opportunity, the market vacuum.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:20):\nI know you've started a couple companies in the past, much smaller scale. In this new role as CEO of this massive hyper growth company, what surprised you most about where you spend the time most or just what the role involves? Because a lot of people want to start companies dream about being in",

In this new role as CEO of this massive hyper growth company, what surprised you most about where you spend the time most or just what the role involves? Because a lot of people want to start companies dream about being in your shoes. What are they maybe not understanding about where a lot of your time goes?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:52:42):\nYeah, it's actually not too surprising. The top two buckets are always working on hiring and time with customers of how do I really deeply understand what customers need and how we can support them? And then how do I build the team and a lot of the processes around that? Of course, there's all of the ad hoc things I didn't expect of dealing with the people questions of how do we set up our levels and our comp bands and all of that, which you learn as you scale a business. But I think that the core places that I spend my time are in line with what I expected as well as what I love doing, which is very fortunate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:27):\nSo these two companies you've started in the past, maybe share what they work because they're fun, and then how do they help you be successful in this? What's something that they taught you that helped you in your current role?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:53:38):\nYeah, so there's been like a dozen, but I'll choose my favorite two. So when I was in eighth grade, I started Donut Dynasty where I saw that Safeway Donuts were selling for $5 a dozen, and I was amazed because I felt like as an eighth grader, this was such an incredible deal. And I started to bike down to Safeway, buy Safeway Donuts for $5 a dozen, and then go back to my middle school and then sell them for $2 each, running really good margins of course. It sold out super quickly. And so then I need to scale up. So I would pay my mom $20 to drive me in her minivan down to Safeway, buy 10 dozen donuts, go to my middle school, sell them all out.\n\n(00:54:19):\nAnd then the school tried to shut me down because I was selling food on school campus, which they didn't like. So they had me in the principal's office asking me to not do that. And then I moved my donut stand over 50 feet, so it was off school campus, saying that they could no longer police me. I remember we had competitors pop up where the competitors were charging. They bought these Chuck's Donuts, which if anyone in the Bay Area knows, are higher end donuts than Safeway Donuts, but they have a higher cost basis. They cost a dollar per. And so I dropped my prices to $1 for two weeks to run them out of business before I knew what anti-competitive practices were. And I'd hire all my friends, paying my friends in donuts because they perceived the donuts as $2 each where they could sell them throughout the school and I could have a lower cost basis on them.\n\n(00:55:12):\nSo I had all of these fun experiences in selling donuts, and then I could talk more about my high school business as well, which was a more significant scale. But I think the takeaway from that was just like you can just do things. So many people have ideas, but the barrier to more companies being built, I think, is just initiative and taking the steps to build the product or experience that customers want and investing the time and the ambition to scale that up. And so I think it was really getting reps of that that enabled me to realize that I should do it later on at a much larger scale.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:51):\nAmazing story. I love how wholesome that is versus drugs, selling donuts.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:55:56):\nThen my mom was very worried. She was like, \"Oh, is there any pot of these donuts?\" I was like, \"No, mom, I assure you these are pure donuts.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:05):\nI love that you paid your mom $20 to drive.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:56:07):\nYeah. She was adamant it couldn't be a handout that she was taking her time to drive me, so she needed to make a little bit of money off of it. We haggled over her title where eventually she wanted to be head of global operations, which we found very entertaining.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:22):\nI hope that's on her LinkedIn.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:56:24):\nNot yet. Maybe she'll have to add it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:27):\nSo you said that you've started a dozen companies?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:56:29):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:29):\nWow. Okay.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:56:30):\nWell, a dozen projects, but I think it was that, and then my AWS company were the two that I scaled up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:39):\nWhat's the story behind Mercor as the name?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:56:42):\nMercor means marketplace in Latin or to buy, sell, trade.

And we want to build the largest marketplace in the world, the marketplace for how everyone finds jobs, and that was really the draw to it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:55):\nOkay, maybe a last question. This is going back to earlier in discussion because it's something I've been thinking about as we're talking. There's been this shift from data as the fuel for models, and now it's experts. Do you think there's a next step, or is this just will take us to AGI, superintelligence?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:57:15):\nI don't think it's necessarily changing from data to experts. It's more just the paradigm of realizing that labs need this close collaboration with experts to help understand what are the evals that they're building and how can they push the frontier. But I think it's very clear that evals are evergreen, that so long as we want to improve models, we'll need experts to create evals for them and to create the post-training data for them to learn those capabilities. And of course there might be changes in the exact way that people do training with RL or otherwise, but they will always need an eval to measure what does success look like across every domain that they want to build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:01):\nOkay. So then building on that, a question that comes up a lot these days is, and I know we're talking about fun stuff but I'm getting to serious stuff again, scaling laws and just progression of model intelligence. A lot of people are feeling like, \"I don't know, it's slowing down. We're not going to really get to superintelligence at this rate.\" What is your sense?\n\nBrendan Foody (00:58:21):\nI totally agree with that. I know there's been some executives to big labs that say we'll have superintelligence in three years, but I think the truth is that it's a longer road. And that's not to diminish from how extraordinary the models are. I think we'll be able to automate a majority of knowledge work tasks in the next 10 years for sure, but that long road is paved with all of the evals that help to make those capabilities possible. And it's not going to be 10X more pre-training data that gets those capabilities. It's much more going to be all of the post-training data sets that are far more data-efficient and thoughtful that help us get there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:05):\nDavid Sachs tweeted this interesting point that the situation we're now is almost the best case scenario where AI is not in this fast takeoff to superintelligence. There's a lot of competitors keeping each other in check. Models are already very valuable and only getting valuable, more valuable, but there's not just this winner superintelligence taking over the world situation.\n\nBrendan Foody (00:59:26):\nYeah, I think that's true. I think a lot of the super intelligence fearmongering is probably overrated, but at the same time a lot of people's framing around that is even if there is a 5 to 10% chance of this P-Doom, then we should be careful, which seems logical. But I think that it's going to be an extraordinary 10 years for all of Silicon Valley and all of the world as this technology is able to create abundance and giving everyone better medical treatment, the best access to legal recommendations, and the ability to build great products more than we've ever seen before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:06):\nAnd education feels like is transforming.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:00:08):\nAbsolutely, right. I even have felt bits of this over the last 10 years where I remember ever... My parents would give me a hard time for not going to classes in college and I'd be like, well, there's way better lectures on YouTube. Why not just listen there? But I can only imagine as the models get extremely good at conveying information, better than the best professor, what that'll mean and access to all sorts of information to better forward humanity and upskill everyone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:41):\nSo I'll use that as a segue to a final question. I'm going to take us to AI Corner, which is a recurring segment on the podcast. What's some way that you personally use AI to do better work to help you in life?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:00:52):\nWell, let's see. I use it a lot to write documents, as you would expect. I also talk to get advice on problems. I find it helpful to just reason through almost as a thought partner because, yeah, I don't know. I find I think better sometimes when I'm talking something through, but I can't talk through everything with colleagues or people around me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:15):\nAnd so this is like ChatGPT Voice Mode mostly or something else.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:01:16):\nYeah, I like ChatGPT Voice Mode a lot. There's stuff-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):\nMe too.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:01:21):\n... or room for improvement, but I am very excited about the future of Voice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:25):\nLet me show you something I built, actually.

I wasn't planning to talk about this, but there's this guy, Eric Antonow, who's been recommended by a lot of people to get him on this podcast. He's this creative product person that's under the radar now. He's at Facebook for a long time. He built this project called Pirate GPT, which is you basically put ChatGPT into a stuffed animal to talk to it. So built a little wise owl. I don't have it on right now.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:01:25):\nWow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:49):\nBut basically you sew in a little speaker right here and you put a little magnet underneath and you can put it on your shoulder and then you just talk to it.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:01:57):\nThat's so cute. Wow. I love it. I'll have to get one of those. Because I have some of the voice assistants in my apartment, but I really want a ChatGPT voice assistant, so I'm excited for-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:07):\nI was just thinking that. Yeah, just come on. Why can't we have a ChatGPT voice just sitting around listening to us all the time. And you can't on your phone because it goes to sleep and it's like, \"Hello, what?\"\n\nBrendan Foody (01:02:17):\nExactly. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:18):\nYeah, so it's what this is trying to be. Well, there's a kickstarter he started that we'll link to that. You could help out.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:02:22):\nThere we go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:23):\nThat's really easy.\n\n(01:02:25):\nBrendan, is there anything else that you wanted to share or touch on or maybe leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lighting round?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:02:32):\nTying to the point around initiative and that you can just do things, I encourage everyone, especially with AI and it being so much easier to build, just take the initiative to go out and build products and talk with customers and take that leap of faith because I think that that is in so many ways, the largest barrier to more innovation, the economy in any way that we can support that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:58):\nYeah. There's so many people that just, let's not bash the podcast, but just listen to podcasts, read posts, just keep reading and listening and don't do anything with that information. And there's never been an easier time to actually build stuff and try stuff.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:03:12):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:12):\nSo definitely take that advice. Just you can do things. You can move your donut stand 50 feet and get out of their jurisdiction.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:03:21):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:21):\nOkay, Brendan, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:03:26):\nAll set.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:27):\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:03:31):\nLet's see. I would say in order, High Output Management is a phenomenal book on running companies. Second is Zero to One, which of course is a classic. And then third is Shoe Dog, where I just find it to be a really inspirational story.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:46):\nWhat is a recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:03:49):\nI really liked Oppenheimer. My favorite TV show of all time is Suits, so I know not recent, but if I had to choose a recent one, probably Oppenheimer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:58):\nVery cool. Suits, first time someone's mentioned that. Favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:04:05):\nI love using Codex, like the new version. I know it's sort of new in terms of version. Yeah, I think it's incredible and just a huge, huge improvement. So yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:19):\nDo you have a life motto that you find yourself coming back to, sharing with folks, finding useful in work or in life?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:04:25):\nI think it's you can just do stuff, what we were talking about earlier. Take the leap of faith.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):\nI thought you were going to say can do, which is in your Twitter profile.\n\nBrendan Foody (01:04:34):\nCan do as well, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:36):\nTwo great ones. Final question. So we were chatting before this about things that we could talk about and you shared this interesting thing that you haven't shared anywhere else, which is that you're dyslexic. Why don't you share that with folks? And just how do you get around that having built the fastest-growing company in history?",

Why don't you share that with folks? And just how do you get around that having built the fastest-growing company in history?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:04:55):\nI don't hide it at all. I think a lot of my colleagues know. And I think on one hand it definitely makes it difficult to go through 1,000 emails a day or read every document that I'm supposed to, but on the other hand, I feel like it helps me to think a little bit differently, to be more creative, and perhaps see that markets are changing that not everyone sees. And so it's turned out okay so far. And so I think one thing it's helped me realize from a management standpoint is that we focus much more on how we can leverage people's strengths rather than helping to improve weaknesses, because there's some things that I'm not great at and I'll never be the best in the world at, and there's others that I can hopefully refine and strive to be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:46):\nThat's such a also recurring theme on this podcast of just focusing on strengths and not focusing over all your focus on weaknesses.\n\n(01:05:53):\nBrendan, this was incredible. I learned so much. I have a billion more questions, but you got shit to do. Two final questions. What should people know about what you're doing and roles you're hiring for? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBrendan Foody (01:06:06):\nAbsolutely. We're hiring a ton across the board on our team. We're hiring strategic project leads on our operations team, software engineers in our engineering team, as well as researchers. And so please go to mercor.com and we would love to work with you, and that's the largest way that you can help us. Share it with your friends as well. Over half of people in our marketplace come from referrals because we have a platform of people that love us.

    "content": "Matthew Dicks (00:00:00):\nEveryone loves the word storytelling in business. It's a huge buzzword. They love to think of themselves as storytellers, but when they come to me, they don't really want to be storytellers. Because to be a storyteller means you have to separate yourself from the herd, and in their mind, that risks them getting picked off, right? Getting picked off by some predator. But the alternative is you're in the herd, which means you're forgettable. I mean, how many times have you gone to a conference, listened to someone speak, and by the time you're pulling into the driveway, you really can't remember anything that they said? Because that's what happens if we don't speak in story. Our minds are not designed to remember a pie chart or facts or statistics or platitudes or ideas that are not attached to imagery. So the risk you take if you're not telling stories is that you will be forgotten. 100%. You will be forgotten.\n\nLenny (00:00:54):\nToday my guest is Matthew Dicks. Matthew is the author of my All-Time favorite book on storytelling Storyworthy, which a previous guest of the podcast recommended to me and I couldn't put it down. So I reached out to Matthew and got him on the podcast. Matthew is a 59-time Moth Story Slam winner, and nine-time Grand Slam champ. He's also the author of nine other books, including fictions, rock operas, even a comic book.\n\n(00:01:20):\nIn his day job, he is an elementary school teacher and on the side teaches both individuals and teams at companies like Slack, Amazon, Lego, and Salesforce. The skill of storytelling and public speaking through his company speak up. In our conversation, we get very tactical about how to tell better stories both in life and in work, how to feel more comfortable speaking on stage, how to come up with story ideas that you can deploy when the need arises. Why every good story is centered around one five-second moment of transformation and so much more. Matt is an incredible human being and I am excited to spread his message more widely. If you're interested in this topic, definitely pick up his book, Storyworthy. It'll change your life. With that, I bring you Matthew Dicks, after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:09):\nToday's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file. And building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never-ending sink for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, but customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date, conversion edge case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is companies like ScaleAI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences. From embeddable, CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like error on line 53, and never end up getting started with your product.

I actually joined Maui Nui Venison earlier this year after hearing their ad on the Tim Ferriss podcast, and I'm excited to be spreading the message further. Not only does this company provide the most nutrient-dense and protein-dense red meat available. Their operation produces the only stress-free 100% wild-harvested red meat on the market. That is the only one of its kind in the world. Actively managing Maui's invasive access to your populations, helping to restore balance to vulnerable ecosystems, food systems, and communities in Hawaii.\n\n(00:03:52):\nAlso, it is seriously delicious. Not at all gamey and easy to cook. My wife and I made stew and steaks and all kinds of grilled goodies with the meat. We also feel great about it as a protein from an ethical standpoint. I highly recommend trying their all-natural venison jerky sticks for an optimal protein snack, as well as a wide variety of fresh cuts all available in their online butcher shop.

I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:33):\nI'm even more excited to have you on. The way I found out about you is a previous guest mentioned your book as a book that really transformed the way they think about storytelling and even marketing. And I completely agree. It's the most tactical, practical, also just entertaining book on just how to tell better stories. And when I was reading, I was just like, \"Hey, what if I reach out to the author of this book and see if he'd come on?\" And here we are.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:04:55):\nI'm thrilled to be here, and I appreciate what you had to say.

I tried to make my book as actionable as possible. I think the only reason I'm successful in what I do is that I've been a teacher for 25 years and I'm a storyteller. So the two of those things come together pretty well for me.\n\nLenny (00:05:12):\nOkay, so I thought it'd be fun to start with maybe the most mind-expanding takeaway I got from this book, is this idea that all good stories are rooted in this five second moment of someone's life. Can you just talk about this insight and maybe share an example or two to make this real?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:05:28):\nSure. Well, that is true what you just said, which is essentially every story is about a singular moment. I call it five seconds. It can be one second honestly. It's a moment of either transformation, meaning I'm telling you a story about how I once used to be one kind of person and now I'm a new kind of person. Or more common is realization. Which is I used to think something and then some stuff happened and now I think a new thing. And those changes they take place overtime. Or really what happens is it's an accumulation of events and feelings and thoughts that ultimately result in a singular moment where that flip actually happens. And I think that's true for almost everyone. It feels like it took a long time, but there really was one second when you thought one thing and then the next second when you thought the new thing.\n\n(00:06:19):\nAnd the purpose of a story is essentially to bring that moment to the greatest clarity possible to the audience. So that the audience can, in a way experience that flip that transformation or realization along with the storyteller. So 98% of the story is the context to bring that singular moment into fruition. And that is true for stories that we tell out loud, stories we tell on the page, novels that I write, movies that I watch, television shows that I watch, all of the stories of the world that are worth hearing and truly just about every story told that qualifies as a story has one of those moments.\n\nLenny (00:06:58):\nThat's a big statement. Is there an example too, you could share of either stories we know or just tell a short story, whatever is easier to give people like, oh wow, you're totally right?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:07:06):\nSure. Well, I'll tell you one that happened actually today. How about that?\n\nLenny (00:07:09):\nAmazing.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:07:10):\nSo I'm teaching math today. I'm an elementary school teacher and I'm teaching math, and I have a student in my class, her name is Eileen, and she's one of those kids that I worry about a little bit because she's got some anxiety. So she's not the most confident person in the world. And in September I was aware of this. So I've been working really hard at building confidence with her. And so today we're doing some math and I'm calling kids to the board, and I'm looking at Eileen and wondering, is today the day? Am I going to call Eileen to the board? Because doing so, there's a risk, there's inherent risk that she could be upset, she could embarrass herself in front of the class in a way that means something to her.\n\n(00:07:52):\nAnd I just wasn't sure. So I didn't call her to the board. And so at the end of the math lesson, I wandered over to her desk and I said, \"So Eileen, I was thinking about calling you to the board today, but I just wasn't sure if you're there yet. What do you think?\" And she said to me, \"First of all, I don't like that cheeky smile of yours.\" And that is all I needed to hear. That was my five-second moment. That was the moment of realization where I understood that Eileen trusted me, felt confident enough in my classroom that she could be herself, that she could fire off a quip at a teacher, sort of take a shot at me. I knew at that point that now I can call her to the board, that she's going to be okay. So essentially it is a very brief story that I could actually expand into something much more meaningful.\n\n(00:08:39):\nI could make that into a five or six minute story about my journey with this student. Which would include, in the longer version of it, the steps that I took to discover who she was, the steps I took to help her reach the point she's at now. I would probably pull in some backstory about students who I was not so successful with. Some of my failures before I learned how to be a better teacher. And then I'd bring it to the moment where she says, first of all, I don't like that cheeky smile, and that's all I need to hear. So that is essentially a five-second moment for me. That is the same though as any other five-second moment. If you think about a movie like Star Wars, the first Star Wars that came out that is a movie essentially about religion, which people don't always see, but it is true.\n\n(00:09:23):\nThere's a boy on a planet and he wants to go to space someday and fly a spaceship and use blasters to defeat the Empire. And along the way, he meets a religious figure to Obi-Wan Kenobi, and he introduces him to a religion called The Force. And",

If you think about a movie like Star Wars, the first Star Wars that came out that is a movie essentially about religion, which people don't always see, but it is true.\n\n(00:09:23):\nThere's a boy on a planet and he wants to go to space someday and fly a spaceship and use blasters to defeat the Empire. And along the way, he meets a religious figure to Obi-Wan Kenobi, and he introduces him to a religion called The Force. And when the final moment comes for Luke Skywalker to defeat the Empire, his vision of using technology, a spaceship and a blaster to destroy the Empire, all of that goes away, and he turns off his technology in his spaceship. Instead, he uses The Force to guide his weapon to defeat the enemy.\n\n(00:09:56):\nAnd that is a story about a boy who once had no religion, and then some stuff happened and he had religion in the end. And that's why a story like that resonates with us in a way that another story might not, because we all understand what it's like to not believe in something and then find belief in something. Whether that is religious belief or I used to think cheeseburgers didn't taste good, and now I believe that they taste good. Either way, we understand that process and we can connect with Luke Skywalker in a meaningful way. So every story essentially has those moments, including, \"I don't like that cheeky smile.\"\n\nLenny (00:10:29):\nWith this moment, what's also interesting is you talk about how knowing that moment of change also tells you how the story will end. So as a storyteller, you'll know how it ends based on knowing what this moment is, which then also tells you how it's going to start roughly. Can you just talk about that realization? Because, to me, every time I watch a movie now I'm like, wow, I know exactly how it's going to turn out just from the beginning.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:10:53):\nSo we start as storytellers at the end. Well, we start at the end if we are telling true stories about ourselves or our companies or our products, things that we know. I'm also a fiction writer. So when I start my novels, that's much more self-discovery. I really don't know the end of it. But in the storytelling that we're talking about, you have to know the end because you've lived the moment, and the end forms everything. So you know what you're going to say. You found a moment worth speaking to, that five-second moment. And then whatever that moment is, in my case, I discover that Eileen has more confidence than I realized and is ready to take a big step forward. What's the opposite of me realizing Eileen has confidence and is ready to step forward? It is, Eileen does not have confidence, and I need to help her find that confidence.\n\n(00:11:39):\nSo that's the opposites that will work in a story. Essentially, a story is about these two moments in time, a beginning and an end, and they're operating in opposition to each other. Sometimes more so than others, sometimes exactly an opposition. But you're right. If you watch a movie and you'll pay attention to the first 10 to 15 minutes of a movie, you will ultimately know how that movie's going to end. You'll see a character, you'll discover what that character needs or their flaw or their desire, and you know that that's going to be at the end. The easiest one is a romantic comedy. Two people are not in love at the beginning of the movie. You know they're going to be in love at the end of the movie. Even knowing it doesn't mean the story's ruined. We can get there in a very entertaining way. When Harry Met Sally, that movie, when it begins, Harry and Sally actually say they hate each other at the very beginning of the movie, \"I Hate You, Harry,\" right?\n\n(00:12:32):\nI hate that man so much. We know they're going to end up together, and the journey is well worth the fact that we know what's going to happen at the end. So it ruins a little bit of storytelling for people who think like me and go, \"Oh, well, I know where this is going.\" But you have to do it in an entertaining way filled with all the other things we talk about in storytelling. But yeah, every story should be essentially a beginning and an end and opposition to each other, and you should start at the end, that guarantees that you have something important to say rather than what most people do, which is they simply report on their lives. They just tell you stuff that happened over the course of time in some chronological way that ultimately doesn't lead to anything. You want to always be saying something of import. So we start at the end with that moment of import.\n\nLenny (00:13:21):\nIt's funny, as I was thinking of when Harry met Sally exactly as you were talking as an example, my wife wants to watch that movie basically every night. It's like the one movie she could just watch a billion times.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:13:31):\nWell, that's the power of story. I tell people this all the time. Why are we telling stories? You've never asked to see a PowerPoint presentation a second time. You've never gone to bed and dreamt about a PowerPoint presentation. You've never heard someone give a keynote and thought, I hope I get to watch that keynote again tomorrow. But movies, you'll watch a movie a hundred times, because it's a story, and our minds are wired to enjoy story over and over and over again. You have a small child, right?

But movies, you'll watch a movie a hundred times, because it's a story, and our minds are wired to enjoy story over and over and over again. You have a small child, right? Eventually you're going to be reading to that child when your baby's old enough and you're going to discover kids want to read the same book 50 times. They're really no different than adults except kid books are so small, you can read them endlessly. A movie takes two hours, so you don't get to read it as often as you might want or watch it as often as you might want. But Harry Met Sally comes on and you're halfway through. You're probably in. Even though every scene you can probably do the dialogue. We're wired for story. That's why it's so important.\n\nLenny (00:14:28):\nWhy is something changing so important? Why is that so critical to a good story, someone having a change or transforming?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:14:35):\nWell, I think that actual moment of transformation lends importance to the story and allows the audience to connect to it. If I report it on my day to you, my day teaching in a classroom, I am unlikely to connect with you unless you are also a teacher and you experienced things similar to me. My wife is a kindergarten teacher. I'm a fifth grade teacher. If both of us report on our day, oddly, we will not really connect very often. She is teaching them how to write the letter C, and I am teaching them how to use the standard algorithm in multiplication. They could not be further apart.\n\n(00:15:11):\nSo reporting on the moments that you have experienced in the day is not a way to connect to people. But when we talk about change, change has a great universal appeal. So you might not be a teacher who's trying to teach someone to find confidence in their life, but you might be a person who once lacked confidence and then found confidence in the way Eileen did. Or you might be a parent or the boss of someone who is trying to bring confidence to your child or your employee, your salesperson, whatever it is. When we do change, when we're focused in on that change, we increase exponentially the universal appeal to the story and our ability to connect to an audience. Even though the content we're speaking about has nothing to do with them, the actual emotional appeal will cause people to connect to us.\n\nLenny (00:16:00):\nFascinating. So building on that same thread of change, you also have this kind of checklist for what makes a good story. What is a good story, and I think it's only a three point checklist. One is there's a change that happens. Can you talk about the other two? I think there's only other two.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:16:16):\nWell, the dinner test is probably one that you're thinking of.\n\nLenny (00:16:19):\nYeah, that's right.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:16:20):\nSo the dinner test is the idea that when you're telling a story in a formal way, if you're performing on a stage or delivering a keynote or even delivering a pitch to entrepreneurs or a sales pitch, essentially the story that you're telling should be very closely related to the story you would tell someone if you were having dinner. So there should be no performance art included within your story or within your talk. So weird things that people do should not be done. Like opening a story with unattributed dialogue. So you're standing on stage and you open your story with, \"Jim, it's time to come in for dinner.\" My wife said, that's just weird. We don't talk like that as regular people, so you should not speak like that ever. In the history of the world, you should never speak like that. But people do it all the time.\n\n(00:17:12):\nIt's this weird appendage from childhood when bad writing teachers thought that this was a good idea, or you start with a sound, which is very popular in first grade. You teach kids to start with sound, mostly because teachers are not writers, so they don't understand what writing actually is. And so they open with stories, with things like, bang, the door opened. But if you and I were having dinner and you said, \"Hey, how was your day, Matt?\" And I said, \"Well, let me tell you Lenny. Bang, the door opened.\" You would not have dinner with me again.\n\n(00:17:41):\nSo you have to be thinking that this is a slightly elevated version of the dinner story. Meaning you're probably not going to be interrupted in the middle of your story. And you want to have a little more shape to it, and you want to avoid some of the verbal detritus that tends to fill our lives. You don't want to be saying, you know, and like I said, all of that nonsense should get pushed to the side, but essentially people should feel like you're kind of speaking in a very natural way. So the dinner test is pretty important in that regard.\n\nLenny (00:18:09):\nAwesome. Yeah, so the lesson there is when you're telling a story, make it sure that it's something that you could potentially tell at a dinner party. Slightly elevated is the way you put it.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:18:18):\nSlightly elevated. Exactly.\n\nLenny (00:18:19):\nI think the third point you make is that it has to be your story. You can't be telling a story on behalf of someone else. Maybe chat about that briefly?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:18",

You can't be telling a story on behalf of someone else. Maybe chat about that briefly?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:18:25):\nSo if you're telling a story about someone else, essentially, you might as well be telling fiction. Because that person's not in the room, and to the audience, they don't really exist. If they can't see them, that person is just another human being who supposedly lives somewhere in the world or once lived in the world. And because of that, you are almost unable to express any vulnerability in your story. You can't reveal anything about yourself. And one of the key parts of storytelling is to be vulnerable with your audience. Meaning I'm going to say stuff in a meaningful way. I might say stuff that most people are unwilling to share in a public way, but I'm at least going to offer up a little bit of my heart and mind. If I offer up the heart and mind of someone else that doesn't really require any vulnerability.\n\n(00:19:09):\nThe only vulnerability is I have to stand in front of people and talk, which I know is challenging for some people, but that doesn't mean anything to the audience. We don't care if you're having a hard time presenting, if it's making you nervous. That doesn't mean much to an audience. What we really want is someone to open up their hearts and minds. So stories have to be about you in some way. There's tricks where you can tell stories about other people by taking that story and centering on yourself.\n\n(00:19:36):\nOne of the examples, I work with the children and grandchildren of Holocaust survivors, and in the past, what they would do is they would just tell the story of the Holocaust survivor who has often at this point passed away, and it really does feel like fiction. A long time ago in a place that wasn't this a terrible thing happened. And there's a certain level of empathy and sympathy that you might feel. But what I teach them to do is to tell stories about themselves. And then at some point in the story about themselves, they're going to talk about how the experience of their parent or grandparent during the Holocaust has informed or changed their own life too. So they get to dip into some history, but that history is relevant to the storyteller. So it's no longer history. It's now something changed in me because something terrible happened to my parent or grandparent.\n\nLenny (00:20:24):\nJust as a tangent, you also have this funny, useful checklist for how to tell vacation stories?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:20:30):\nWell, first try not to, right?\n\nLenny (00:20:32):\nI think that's step one. Do not tell vacation stories.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:20:34):\nMost vacation stories are just simply a recounting of your vacation at the expense of another person. So unless something happened on that vacation where you experienced one of these five second fundamental moments of change, nobody cares about your vacation. And if something did happen, only be talking about the moment when it happened. So if I had a moment of change that took place on a Thursday night at dinner, that story is now going to take place on the Thursday night at dinner, and it's irrelevant that I'm in Aruba.\n\n(00:21:07):\nThe fact that I am on vacation is almost completely irrelevant to the story, other than I may want to offer my location. But I'm not going to talk about the beach the day before or the scuba diving or the plane. All of that goes away. We're telling moments in our lives, and it doesn't matter where they happen. If your location is paramount to your story because you want people to know you were in Aruba, then you have to understand, no one actually cares that you were in Aruba and you're just a terrible person for trying to dump that on someone and use up their time so you can relive your vacation and perhaps humble brag about how much fun you had.\n\nLenny (00:21:46):\nThis will be a good segment for people to send their friends if they want to tell them their vacation stories. And here's a tip for how to do this better.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:21:51):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:21:52):\nAnd just understand why it needs to be on a Thursday in that dinner, is the advice there? Keep it very focused and small, unless there's some really essential reason to share the context around the dinner.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:22:03):\nYeah, exactly. The shortest version of every story is the best version of every story. Starting as close to the end of a story is always the best place to begin. So if I had a moment of realization during dessert in a restaurant in Aruba, I may never tell them I'm in Aruba. I might start my story with, the dessert hits the table, and my wife says something that causes me to begin thinking, and that would be the beginning of the story. The fact that I'm on an island in the Caribbean may never come up in the entire story because it doesn't turn out to be relevant to the story.\n\nLenny (00:22:39):\nThere's a lesson that another guest shared, West Cow about... She calls it, When The Bear Starts Eating Your Tent, or something like that. Jump to when the bear is eating your tent. Don't do this whole introduction to why or how you got to this tent.

It's just like the bear is eating our tent. That's where the story should start.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:22:54):\nYes, Kurt Vonnegut said that. Kurt Vonnegut said, \"Start as close to the end as possible.\" He was talking about short stories written on the page, but it is a true notion in oral storytelling too. And it is, of all the things I help people with their stories, the most frequent suggestion that I make for revision is you've started your story in the wrong place.\n\nLenny (00:23:16):\nI want to shift to business context advice. But before we do that, there's another really important element of storytelling, which is having stakes and having important stakes. So could you just talk about what is a stake and why is it important to have stakes? And then just what are examples of adding stakes to your story to make them more encouraging?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:23:32):\nSure. So stakes are essentially what your audience should be worried about, what they should be wanting for you, what they should be concerned about, what they should be wondering about. If your audience isn't wondering what you're about to say, they're no longer listening to you. And you have to internalize that in a deep and fundamental way. When I work with people in business, they are constantly under this misconception that people want to hear what they have to say. Some vice president of marketing thinks that because they're a vice president of marketing and everyone is sitting in a chair and looking at them, that they automatically have that audience's attention. I assume all the time, 100% of the time, that no one wants to hear anything I have to say. And so I am relentless in my attempt to get the audience to be constantly wondering what the next sentence is.\n\n(00:24:17):\nAnd stakes are a big part of that. Stakes are, I wonder what's going to happen next. I'm worried about this guy. Will he get what he wants? Will he get his comeuppance? Because he seems like a kind of a jerk in this story. All of those things are stakes. What is at stake for the storyteller, the company, the product, whatever it is, and therefore what the audience is worried about as well.\n\n(00:24:39):\nIt's why Star Wars opens with a big spaceship shooting at a small spaceship. We don't even know who's on it yet, but we're already on the small spaceship side. We're already worried that a small spaceship is being shot at by a big spaceship, right? That's why stories start this way. Alfred Hitchcock has a movie where it opens with a police officer is chasing a man across a roof. We don't know who to root for, but something is at stake here. And now we're wondering what's going to happen next. We have to do the same thing with our ordinary true life everyday stories. We have to put stakes into stories.\n\nLenny (00:25:12):\nThere's something that you teach around surprise and the power of surprise as a part of stakes. I forget exactly what that is, but does that ring a bell?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:25:19):\nWell, I'll separate them really. So with stakes, there's lots of ways to insert stakes. I always say you should have, what I call an elephant at the beginning of the story, which is actually a big spaceship shooting at a little spaceship or a police officer chasing a guy across a roof. We have to immediately know that something is at stakes. We have to be worried about something. In my little Eileen story that I told you, I said, I'm teaching math and I've got this student and I'm worried about her, because I want to call her to the board, but I know she might lack some confidence. Right away, I have to make it clear what kind of story we're at. In a movie, you get a trailer. You don't often go to a movie and not have any awareness about what's about to happen. But when you open your mouth to begin telling a story, nobody knows what you're going to say. You need to land something immediately that...\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:26:00):\nNobody knows what you're going to say. You need to land something immediately that causes an audience to go, \"Oh, okay, well what's going to happen here?\" So that's an elephant. That's like plant some big thing in the beginning of a story. It doesn't actually have to be what the story's about either. Sometimes it takes a little time to get to what the story's about, but you plant something there to at least get the audience to be worried, and then you can use some other tricks. I call something called a backpack, which is, you tell the audience what your plan is before you carry out your plan so that they sort of have your hopes and dreams packed up with them as well. If you watch an Ocean's 11 movie, you know what the plan is before they go into the casino. So as the plan goes awry, you can go, \"Oh no,\" because you know what the plan is.\n\n(00:26:42):\nIf you didn't know what the plan was, you would not be able to go, \"Oh no.\" So that's loading your audience with your hopes and dreams so that they can feel those stakes. They can actually be hoping for you as well. There's things like breadcrumbs where you offer",

They can actually be hoping for you as well. There's things like breadcrumbs where you offer a little bit of what's going on, but not the complete idea, sort of drop a hint. The classic one is sort of the gun. There's a gun in the room, and there's a gun in the room, and it seems like it's not going to be relevant, but if you have a gun in the room, it's going to eventually go off. There's something going on there. That's like a bread crumb. Eventually we're going to get to that gun. Don't worry, it's going to happen. There's hourglasses, which is when you get to the moment where everyone is about to discover what's going to happen. That's the moment to slow time down.\n\n(00:27:28):\nYou load your story with details because suddenly you know have the audience on the edge of their seat, and you want to leave them on the edge of their seat as long as possible. When I know my audience wants to hear the next sentence, that is when I prolong the arrival of the next sentence by I say turning over an hourglass and letting the sand run for a while, and making them wait for it. There's crystal balls where you can predict a future. You don't have to predict an accurate future. You can just predict any future. So I could have said something in the Eileen story like, \"If I get this wrong, Eileen is going to begin to cry. She's going to cry in front of 22 kids, 22 kids who for the rest of the year will continue to stare at this girl, and remember the moment she cried.\" That's a crystal ball.\n\n(00:28:10):\nThat's me predicting a terrible future. Because I put that terrible future in the audience's mind, now they're worried. So that is a stake. I have planted a false stake, a false future, but they're going to be worried about it because it's also a realistic future. So all of those things are used to continue to get the audience to wonder what's going to happen next, which is a little different than surprise. Surprise is just that beautiful, delightful, amazing moment where the audience didn't see something coming, and then it was almost like it was inevitable. Surprise happens, and they understand why it happened. I think it's the best thing you can ever offer an audience, is a moment of surprise. And every story has a surprise, at least one. Because whenever we suddenly realize something for the first time, I hate the word suddenly, but what happens is we used to not think something, and then we think a new thing, and that's often a surprise for us if we make it a surprise for the audience too, that's a delightful thing. So surprise is so powerful, and wonderful, and always ruined by storytellers.\n\nLenny (00:29:11):\nI was just listening to an interview with, I think his name is David Mamet, and he made this point that endings of books and movies always has to be both inevitable, and also complete surprise.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:29:21):\nYes, both of those things. So inevitable means there has to be enough information placed earlier in the story so that when the surprise happens, the audience goes, \"Yes.\" But also you have to be clever enough to plant that information in such a way that the audience doesn't see the surprise coming. You build information into the audience's mind that will allow the surprise to land in an inevitable and yet surprising way. That is the best surprise you can offer someone.\n\nLenny (00:29:51):\nEasier said than done.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:29:52):\nYes, well, there's lots of tricks to do that as well, but it takes some time. But essentially what you end up doing is, you're hiding the information that they need to know in a multitude of ways so that when it lands, they go, \"Oh my gosh, ABCD.\" They don't connect it until the surprise hits, and then they go, \"Of course, ABCD.\" So you place ABCD in a story, but you don't place it in such a way that they can connect the dots until you want them to connect the dots.\n\nLenny (00:30:20):\nI feel that's a whole other hour of podcast conversation to figure that out.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:30:23):\nThat's like ninja level next level storytelling, which is very teachable. Everything I say is very, very teachable and doable by anybody, but yes, it's a trickier thing to accomplish.\n\nLenny (00:30:35):\nOkay, that'll be for a second podcast episode. Just to summarize, you shared I think five ways add stakes. Just to summarize; one is crystal ball. You basically predict the bad thing that'll happen if you don't do this thing. Hourglass, which is when something is about to happen slow time down. I think of Pulp Fiction and Tarantino in this often of just like, you know some violence is about to happen, and they go next door, and like, \"Let's just eat a cheeseburger,\" instead for a while. And then this backpack idea of they know exactly what you're trying to do, and it's on you and the entire movie. Breadcrumbs where you give them a little bit of information along the way. I think maybe that's it. Maybe there's one more.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:31:12):\nAnd then",

I wish-\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:31:16):\nYou got to have something.\n\nLenny (00:31:18):\nI heard some advice in either your book, a different book about adding stakes is just drop a dead body. Every new dead body is additional stakes that are added to the story. I don't know how often people can do that in random stories.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:31:30):\nBut what you can take from that is, so often people load the front end of a story with all of the stakes because they're worried that the audience will not pay attention to them. So they think I'm going to throw everything right in front, and that'll hold an audience for the rest of the story, and that's a mistake. What we want is stakes continually to build throughout a story. So dropping a dead body really means, drop a new steak, don't load it all, don't front load it, give us something to wonder about, and then gauge when we need the next thing to wonder about, and spread out those stakes. We need most of the stakes to occur within the first half of a story. Ideally, the second half of the story is now the rollercoaster to the end. So we might drop one in there at an appropriate time, or just through plot. Sometimes they just happen to need to be in a place. But so often I hear people front load stakes because they're worried about audience attention.\n\nLenny (00:32:21):\nJust to give people something concrete to think about when they're thinking about this area. Is there a story of yours that's online that we can point people to see an example of really good stakes in action?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:32:31):\nSo the one that I reference in my book, which you can go watch online is, Charity Thief. It needs a lot of stakes because two thirds of the story nothing really happens. Two thirds of the story is explaining how I end up on a porch. So that's not super entertaining unless I build in lots of stakes along the way. I'm not inventing anything, I'm just presenting the actual events in a way that makes you wonder what's going to happen next. So there's an elephant at the beginning of that story, which is actually not what the story's about because I say the elephant can change colors along the way, but I give you something to wonder about along the way. I know I use a backpack, and I use a breadcrumb, and an hourglass, and a crystal ball. I do it all in that story mostly because it's not super entertaining.\n\n(00:33:19):\nSome stories you don't have to worry so much about. I perform as a stripper in the break room of a McDonald's restaurant when I'm 19 years old for a bachelorette party. There are stakes in that story, but I don't need to put any of them in because everybody wants to know what's going to happen already. Sometimes you just have a story that the stakes are already pre-built because the ridiculousness of the moment. But most of our stories are not like that. Most of them are far more benign, and we have to jack up the stakes by using some tricks to get people to the point we want them to be in.\n\nLenny (00:33:50):\nThat stripper story I've also watched, and I'll point to it, and I love, it's connected to another piece of advice you always shared. People just say yes to stuff, at the power of yes. I don't want to get into it yet, I want to come back to that.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:34:00):\nTrue.\n\nLenny (00:34:00):\nWe'll leave that breadcrumb but I love that point. Okay, so let's transition to helping people in business learn all these skills, and translate them to becoming better in their work. And maybe actually to add some stakes, what benefits do people get/what problems do they run into if they aren't great at storytelling versus if they learn the skill, and can implement it at work? What happens, what good things come out of that?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:34:25):\nWell, if you don't tell stories as part of your business, whether you're looking for investment, or speaking to your people, or speaking to customers, or clients, anything, if you're not telling stories, the good news is, you're just like everybody else. The bad news is, you're mediocre just like everybody else. You're in a lane that everyone else is in, which means that you're going to be forgettable. I often say most communication in business is round white and flavorless intentionally so because a lot of people are afraid to stand out. When I try to get people to tell stories, everyone loves the word storytelling in business. It's a huge buzzword. They love to think of themselves as storytellers, but when they come to me, they don't really want to be storytellers because to be a storyteller means you have to separate yourself from the herd, and in their mind that risks them getting picked off, getting picked off by some predator.\n\n(00:35:18):\nBut the alternative is, you're in the herd, which means you're forgettable.

How many times have you gone to a conference, listened to someone speak, and by the time you're pulling into the driveway you really can't remember anything that they said? My wife and I actually attended an educational conference recently. She's a teacher, I'm a teacher. There was a bunch of speakers. The first person came out with his childhood lunchbox, put it on a table, and told a story about how his parents had nothing while he was growing up. And yet they somehow kept him in new shoes, and a new backpack every year, and sent him to school with a lunch every day, and how much it meant to him, and how as an educator today he thinks about every single kid in his class like he was, a kid who had nothing except for all of his parents' hopes and dreams.\n\n(00:36:04):\nI'll never forget that story. It was a story. It was a story of vulnerability, and humor and meaning. There was another person who spoke, a sort of executive we'll say, and he did a great job in terms of being fluent, and presenting ideas, and speaking well, and speaking confidently. And 15 minutes after the conference I said to my wife who is a teacher and understands storytelling because we do it together.\n\n(00:36:27):\nI said, \"What'd you think?\" She said, \"Well, I'm never going to forget that guy with the lunchbox.\" I said, \"I will not either.\" I said, \"What'd you think about the other guy?\" And she goes, \"He was great.\" I said, \"So what did he say?\" Five teen minutes after, and she went, \"I actually can't tell you a single thing he said.\" This is a woman who's a teacher, and invested in storytelling and communication. Her impression was, he was fluent, he was amusing, he said some numbers, he said some things that seemed to mean something. But it was all forgotten because that's what happens if we don't speak in story. Our minds are not designed to remember a pie chart, or facts, or statistics, or platitudes, or ideas that are not attached to imagery. So the risk you take if you're not telling stories is that you will be forgotten, 100% you will be forgotten.\n\nLenny (00:37:18):\nWhen people hear this, they may think, \"Oh man, there's this guy at work, and he's always telling stories.\" And we're like, \"Shut up.\" Just tell me what we need to do to make it a little more real of just what does storytelling look like where it's not annoying. It's not like, \"Okay, everyone, gather around. Let me tell you the story of our vision.\" What are some simpler ways, and maybe non-annoying ways to think about what storytelling looks like in the workplace that's not just like a public speaking like, \"Hey, everyone, I'm going to give you.\"\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:37:43):\nLet me give a couple of examples. I have a storytelling book coming out next year on business. So there's a couple of heroes in that story. One of them is named Boris. His name's Boris Levin, he is a factory owner here in Connecticut. He's the one who convinced me I could start working with businesses. I thought it was just a storyteller who spoke about himself on a stage. Boris one day saw me for some fundraiser and said, \"Listen, I want you to come and help me.\" I said, \"I can't do that. I just tell. I'm using stories about myself.\" He said, \"No, no, you can help me.\" And it turns out he was totally right. So Boris has done it the right way. Boris has decided to become a storyteller who will then translate his stories into his business.\n\n(00:38:19):\nSo a great example was, one of Boris's early stories, he came to me, and he said, \"My son was at bat in the Little League Championship game. The bases were loaded, if my son got a hit, the team was going to win the championship. And if my son struck out, the team would lose the championship.\" It's a three and two count. It is like the ultimate baseball moment, and his son strikes out. He watches his son drag that bat back to the dugout. He's devastated. His son's devastated and Boris is devastated. So he is trying to collect himself so he can figure out the right thing to say to a boy who's just lost the championship for his team. By the time he makes it onto the other side of the field to catch up with his son, he sees his son running up a hill with his friends, and they're already laughing.\n\n(00:39:09):\nThey're heading to the cars so they can go to ice cream, and they can enjoy themselves. So Boris is falling apart. He's still devastated, but his son has already moved past the failure. Boris takes that story, and he crafts it as a beautiful story that he could tell on a stage, and perform and make, an audience laugh and cry. Once the story's done, he says to me, \"So what are we going to do with it? How are we going to apply this to business?\" And ultimately what happens is this, he's got a sales team. And quite often salespeople do not land the big account they're hoping to land, and",

Once the story's done, he says to me, \"So what are we going to do with it? How are we going to apply this to business?\" And ultimately what happens is this, he's got a sales team. And quite often salespeople do not land the big account they're hoping to land, and Boris knows that when his salespeople fail to achieve what they want to achieve, they will often sulk for days. They'll wander around the office, and be useless because they're still trying to get past the fact that they just lost the million dollar contract.\n\n(00:39:56):\nSo he tells the story about his son, and he says, \"Listen, there's nothing wrong with being sad, being upset with failure, but we cannot allow it to slow us down as much as we are right now. We have to think about my son. My son dragged his bat back to the dugout. He sat down, he sighed, his buddies patted him on the back, he collected himself, and he moved on. That's what we need to do. When we fail we're going to take a moment to collect ourselves, to think about the mistakes we made, to decide what we're going to do differently, and then we're going to move on.\" That becomes a really important moment in his company.\n\n(00:40:32):\nIt's much better than him standing up in front of his people and saying, \"Listen, every time you guys fail to land a big sale, you wander around this office like you're dead, and you're wasting our time. It ends today. Today from now on when you fail, you're going to move on.\" The story becomes something meaningful to everyone because it reveals something about Boris. He's a father, he's a father who cares about his son. He's the kind of father that most of us are in life. He shares of himself with his people, and he creates a tangible vision of what the sales team can do. He does that all the time. He comes to me, and he's not looking to solve problems through story. He's looking to develop stories that he can then deploy into his business. So I compare it, I say, band-aids versus bricks. If you're building bricks, you're a storyteller that's capturing stories and building bricks, then you can eventually deploy into business. If you're a band-aid person, which is fine, that happens. \"I have a problem, Matt, and I need a story to solve it.\"\n\n(00:41:34):\nEssentially what I'm doing there is I'm putting a band-aid over a problem, but you're not becoming a better storyteller. You're just using me as a consultant to help you generate a story that will solve a problem. That's fine, but you're going to need me the next time too. You're going to keep needing me because you're not really becoming a storyteller. Boris is building bricks. He is building a vault of stories that he can then deploy into his business. He understands how to tell them, and how to connect them to business. So that's something that you can do very easily.\n\n(00:42:02):\nAnother example, the other star of my book is a woman named Marsha Rakofsky. She used to be the director of corporate communications at Slack, and now she's sort of doing work on her own. But when she was with Slack, she and I were working closely together, and she had to create the narrative that was going to compete against Microsoft Teams. Essentially, Microsoft came along and said, \"Hey, we copied your product and it's free, and everybody already has it.\"\n\n(00:42:25):\nSo Slack had to find a way to combat that, and Marsha was the one in charge of doing it. That's why we connected. She found me and said, \"I need to tell a good story. Please help me tell a good story.\" So she crafted a brilliant narrative that worked fantastically. We worked really closely together, and it came out great. The way she came up with that narrative was a Tuesday night. She had broken up with her boyfriend, she was alone. She was feeling pretty lonely. It was in the midst of the pandemic. She had two glasses of wine in her, sitting alone on a Tuesday night, she suddenly had an inspiration. She wrote three words down on a napkin, and those three words become the story that we develop that allows Slack to compete against Microsoft.\n\n(00:43:04):\nWhen it comes time to her present that narrative, I say, \"You're going to include the Tuesday night and the two glasses of wine, and all that, right?\" And she's like, \"No, I'm not. That's not what we do in the corporate world. We do not insert ourselves into our narratives.\" And to her credit, she didn't put it in, and it still worked brilliantly. She was fine. But about a month later, she was presenting that same narrative to a smaller group, lower stakes. I said, \"Let's just put it in, just try it this time.\" And to her everlasting credit, she did. She put in a 30-second anecdote about Tuesday night, two glasses of wine, feeling lonely in the middle of a pandemic.\n\n(00:43:42):\nShe said to me later, \"I can't believe the difference that that 30 second anecdote meant to the narrative. Because suddenly when I reached the end of the narrative, people wanted to talk to me. People came up to me, and the first thing they said was,\" \"Oh God, I remember I was feeling the same way during the pandemic.\"\n\n(00:43:59):\nPeople connected to her because instead of being a corporate monolith",

People came up to me, and the first thing they said was,\" \"Oh God, I remember I was feeling the same way during the pandemic.\"\n\n(00:43:59):\nPeople connected to her because instead of being a corporate monolith, sort of like Slack spokesperson without personality, which is what we tend to be in business, she was an actual human being who had an inspiration on the Tuesday night, and then was bringing it forth in a meaningful way to an audience. And from that point on, she always has been doing those things in storytelling. She's always looking for a way in her narratives to insert herself, or if she's working with a client, let's find a way that we can work the client into the story as well. Because people don't want to hear spokespeople present information. They want to hear human beings connect with you, and then offer you something that perhaps will have value.\n\nLenny (00:44:41):\nThat is a really interesting lesson. So is your advice just when you're telling stories in business, try to find a way to make it personal about you as the person telling the story?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:44:50):\nYeah. I have this tool I use with corporate folks called, a personal interest inventory. It is a list of all the things that you should be saying about yourself in clever and strategic ways that I teach. Each one of them has an addressable market. So how many people could this potentially hit? And then the intensity of the connection. So for example, if you're married, you should always make it clear to people you're married, especially if you're a man. Because if you're a man, and you're married, you're safer in the world because men are inherently just dangerous human beings. We just are. If you hear that there was a shooting, you never think, \"Oh, I wonder if that was a twenty-three- year-old blonde woman.\" You know who did the shooting almost all the time. So if you're married, what you're essentially saying to people is, someone has agreed to spend theoretically their life with me.\n\n(00:45:41):\nIt's like a validation that I have, at least hygiene and some decency. Most people are in a committed relationship so that means that a total addressable market is large. If I say I'm married, you're either married also, or you're in a committed relationship. So the connection is going to be large. The total addressable market is large. The possible connection, probably moderate. I say it's like, \"It's okay.\" But weird ones are like runners. I'm not a runner, and there's not a lot of runners in the world. But if you're a marathoner, your total addressable market is very small. There's not that many marathoners. But if you happen to find a marathoner, the intensity of that connection is enormous. Marathoners are almost automatically friends upon meeting what I've discovered. If you're just, \"Oh, you ran a marathon? I ran a marathon.\" They're best friends already.\n\n(00:46:32):\nSo if you've run a marathon, and you're in a room and you discover someone else's run a marathon, you have to find a way to bring that out because the possibility of that connection is incredibly intense. So as a person in the corporate world, you should not be seeking to be round, white and flavorless. You should be seeking to be full of color, and full of edge, and full of flavor. You want to be an individual that people remember as opposed to what most people are trying to be, which is, I am just operating this corporate, or this business sphere, and I'm not trying to stand out, which is just a foolish thing to want to do.\n\nLenny (00:47:07):\nI could see why people wouldn't naturally do this. If I'm a head of comms for a company, the last thing I want is to make it about me. And what you're saying is, you actually should, because people will find it a lot more interesting.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:47:20):\nYeah, you don't want to make it all about you, but there's just little tricks. The easiest trick is, if someone asks you, \"How are you doing today?\" If you say, \" I'm doing great,\" you've just really screwed it up. That's the stupidest answer you can offer. If you ask me, \"How am I doing today,\" I'm immediately going to think to myself, elementary school teacher is probably my best personal interest inventory item. Because if I'm an elementary school teacher, everyone loves me. They think I'm doing God's work, even though they don't want to pay me a dime to do it. So if you say, \"How are you doing today?\" I will say to you, \"Pretty good. My fifth graders were actually decent human beings today. They didn't try to kill me.\"\n\n(00:48:01):\nSo in that way, I'm going to slip in the fact that I'm an elementary school teacher by answering your question, I'm going to demonstrate a bit of amusing content in the process, and maybe a little self deprecation. But whenever I'm asked a question, I am trying to include an item of my personality, my life, something that might be of interest to people while also answering the question. You don't want to walk into a situation and say, \"Hi, I'm a married elementary school teacher with two kids and two cats.\" But that's what I want to do because I know that that's going to make people feel connected to me. So I have to find strategic ways to work it in. I teach people to do it",

So I have to find strategic ways to work it in. I teach people to do it all the time. But it starts with understanding what about you might mean something to other people, and how can I get it in there without me sounding like I'm only talking about myself?\n\nLenny (00:48:48):\nWhat else? So we're basically talking about ways to become a better communicator and storyteller in business. You've shared a few tidbits here. One is, think of this personal inventory about yourself that makes you relatable. Try to share it in stories you tell, and presentations, and things like that. What else can people do to become better storytellers in business? I know this is a big question, but let's see where it goes.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:49:07):\nLet's go back to the idea that in business, you have to accept the fact that nobody wants to hear anything you have to say, that is not accepted by most people, even after I say it. So once you understand that, and once you truly believe it, there's essentially four ways to keep people listening to you in any story really, but especially in business, because really no one wants to listen to you in business. So the first is stakes, which we've really talked about already. You have to have stakes. In every good product story and every good PowerPoint... Everything, there are stakes, and they're set out and exactly the way I've described. All five of the stakes that I've described to you that I use in that story, Charity Thief can also be used in every business story, every PowerPoint deck, every entrepreneur pitch, everything. So stakes is one of them.\n\n(00:49:52):\nAnother one we've talked about is, surprise. I should absolutely be surprised in every talk that you give. Steve Jobs was a master of it. We could look at one of his talks, and I could show you how he planned it perfectly. Some others include suspense. So keeping an audience in suspense, and often suspense leads to surprise. So mastering the ability to be suspenseful. And then humor, daring to be funny, which no one in corporate America can do. Everyone wants to be funny. Every person I've ever met, who I've worked with, every business person in some way wanted to be funny, but that's really not actually what they want. They want to have been funny, because being funny means you must take a risk. You must say something that you believe is funny, and you expect an audience to also feel it's funny, and if it doesn't happen, that hurts.\n\n(00:50:43):\nSo people oftentimes tell me they want to be funny, but when I tell them how they need to be funny, they say, \"Well, I can't say that.\" And then I say, \"Well, that's the part that's funny.\" So I was working with a guy, sort of an executive at a company that you interact with every day. He was delivering a talk at the Javits Center, and he was going to be funny. We built in a talk, lots of jokes. He was ready to go. He went to the Javits Center, and four hours later he called me, and I said, \"How'd it go?\" He said, \"I pulled out all the jokes.\" I said, \"Why did you pull out all the jokes?\" He said, \"The first two speakers weren't funny at all. I felt like if I went on stage and I was funny, I was going to stick out like a sore thumb.\"\n\n(00:51:27):\nI said, \"No, you were going to rise from the ashes like a phoenix that everyone has been waiting to hear all day.\" It's the best thing in the world to follow two terrible people, and then go out there and land some jokes. But again, he thought, I have to stay within the confines of the herd rather than doing something different. But humor is a brilliant, and beautiful, and simple way to differentiate yourself from other people, but you have to be willing to try to do it. It's a scary thing for people. But I say it stakes, it's surprise, it's suspense, and it's humor. Those are the ways that you're going to.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:52:00):\nStakes, it's surprise, it's suspense, and it's humor. Those are the ways that you're going to hold people and keep them listening. And if you're not engaged in one of those four things while you're speaking, people are not listening to you anymore.\n\nLenny (00:52:12):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth.

To follow this thread on humor which I was going to ask, what do you tell people to become more funny? What are some tricks?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:53:17):\nWell, I have currently 26 strategies to be funny. Some are better for business than others. I will give you two that we can use in business all the time. The first one you can use is nostalgia, because nostalgia is always funny. The fact that the first VCR I had was 22 pounds and had a remote control attached by a cord that was thick enough that I could trip my brother as he walked through the living room is funny. The fact that I grew up and no one was allergic to anything and we all ate bread, packed with gluten and baked in asbestos factories and no one ever wore a helmet while they rode their bike. All of these things can be made to be funny. And it's so easy in business because oftentimes you are rolling out a new product or a new service or you're updating a product or service in a way that allows you to speak nostalgically about the past.\n\n(00:54:09):\nI was working with this company and they failed me. They did not listen to my advice which was a mistake. They're like an Indeed company. They're helping find employees for companies they're one of these people. And I wanted to start their narrative with the idea of in 1983, the primary source of employment was a 16-year- old kid riding on the back of a Schwinn, throwing newspapers at doors. And in that newspaper, which was like a paper version of the internet, you would turn to the back page and on that page there was the help wanted ads. And that was essentially all you had to find a job in 1983. Everything was geographically based, meaning you only could look into three or four towns around you to find a job. And it had to be in the paper and you had to own a phone connected to a wall so you could call a company within business hours and hope to get an interview.\n\n(00:55:03):\nAll of the power lived with the employers in 1983 and a 16-year-old who was dropping a newspaper off at your porch every day. That's funny. Again, I didn't even try to be funny with it. I just stated the facts. We could have punched that up and made it really funny. And then we flip the script again, the opposites in story. In the beginning, employers had all the power. Today, employees have all the power. Because today you can work in Singapore or Chattanooga, while you're living in Orlando. And today you don't have to wait for a 16-year-old to deliver the paper with all of your job opportunities. Every single job opportunity on the planet is now accessible to you on the internet. And you can work basically anywhere from anywhere. So that's why we need companies like Indeed or the company I was working for, because they have to actually gain some power for the employers.\n\n(00:55:57):\nSo that was the narrative we were going to tell, and the beginning would've been funny. And the CEO of the company said, \"I don't like it.\" He said, \"Nobody cares about the 1980s.\" Which was the dumbest thing he could have said because Stranger Things was the biggest television show on television at the time, which was nothing. But in 1980s. And if he just looked around, he would see that 1980s fashion is coming back. 1980s music is being popularized again. We're remaking 1980s music all the time. Taylor Swift put out an album called 1989. Whether or not the 1980s are relevant or not, it's relevant to talk about the past as a company to demonstrate your expertise in your field. To understand that we know the market backwards and forwards for the last 50 years. We have expertise and we can demonstrate it by telling a story. So that's the power of nostalgia and we can use that all the time in business to make people laugh.\n\n(00:56:50):\nThe other one I'll give you, again, there's a whole bunch, but a simple one is a game they used to play on Sesame Street, which is one of these things that's not like the other. Essentially it's three things. Two of them are expected and one is unexpected, and the unexpected one will be funny. So you can say like, well, my competitor, they have this. My hardware competitor, the guy down the street, he does sell shovels just like I do. That's true. And he does offer a wide selection of nails just like I do. But there's a nameless, faceless machine at the front of the store that you have to swipe your own stuff through and your credit card, there's not actually a human being in the store. And we can make that funny by showing that the third one is unlike the other two. So it's essentially a simple game once I've told it to you, you'll see every comic do it all the time. They just say thing that's expected, thing that's expected, unexpected thing, and you make it funny. So it's a simple trick that we use in business",

    "content": "the front of the store that you have to swipe your own stuff through and your credit card, there's not actually a human being in the store. And we can make that funny by showing that the third one is unlike the other two. So it's essentially a simple game once I've told it to you, you'll see every comic do it all the time. They just say thing that's expected, thing that's expected, unexpected thing, and you make it funny. So it's a simple trick that we use in business all the time.\n\nLenny (00:57:52):\nThis is awesome. This list you're talking about, is this going to be in your new book that you're writing?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:57:58):\nNot all 26 of them because some are not the best business ones in the world, but a large number of them. I think I maybe have the top 12 that work best in business in terms of humor. But you can just take a humor class. I teach humor all the time. I teach all 26 strategies. It's something that can be practiced. The beautiful thing is so often many of the strategies that I offer in business, if it doesn't end up being funny, you're still telling a story. It's not a ba-bum-bum-ching joke. We're not telling those jokes. We're telling humor in the confines of a story so that if this joke doesn't land we're still telling a story. And oftentimes people don't even realize we were trying to be funny.\n\nLenny (00:58:44):\nI'm going to come back to where story can help you in your work. So obviously giving a public talk is the classic way to use this, maybe giving a PowerPoint deck in a meeting. Is there any other maybe non-obvious places that you think this skill can help you in that's not just like, \"Hey everyone welcome to my...\"\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:59:02):\nWell, I've worked with a lot of scientists in biotech and places like that. I worked with a biotech company. Five of their scientists were going to a conference. And essentially it's a company that sells tubes. All of their competitors sell a tube for experiments and you have to retrofit the tube to fit your needs. The company I was working with, they sell 12 different versions of the tube. Better sized so you don't have to retrofit it, much more expensive, but the reliability of your experiments are improved by using their properly sized tubes. So I prepare all the scientists and they all do a good job. They all tell stories of some sort and they go off to their conference.\n\n(00:59:43):\nOne guy though doesn't present any data whatsoever. He just tells a story. He tells a story about going to the grocery store and when he goes to the grocery store, his family is really annoying when it comes to apples. Because everyone likes a different apple. So he's got to go and he is got to buy three Honeycrisp for his wife and two Gala for his daughter. And they're baking a pie this week so they got to get some McIntosh and he likes Red Delicious. He said, \"It's a nightmare buying these apples.\" So he tells that story about the nightmare of buying apples, and then he says, \"That's what my company does.\" There are companies that say, \"We offer McIntosh, make do with it. You're going to make your pies, you're, you're going to eat it. All of the things that you want to do with an apple, all you get is McIntosh. Good luck. We believe you should have access to all the apples. We believe that you have particular needs and specific requirements, and we're going to make sure you have it. Just like my family gets all the apples they want.\n\n(01:00:42):\nIt's all he said. A longer version of it, but that's it. No data. He got more leads at the conference than the other four scientists combined. Now the vice president of marketing was not happy about this at all when I met I met with her. Because she's a scientist. She's 50 years old. For her entire life, she's been sending scientists to conferences and presenting data. And she said to me, \"So what am I going to do? Send scientists to conferences now and not present data?\" And I said, \"Well, I mean maybe because it worked\" And she said, \"Well, what about the data?\" I said, \"Now that he has the leads, you don't think they're going to want the data?\" He's going to get on the phone and they're going to say, tell us about the data. But now they've established a connection.\n\n(01:01:22):\nAnd the best thing about that story, the thing she didn't even understand was, every single time someone at that conference goes into a grocery store now and they're looking at apples, they're going to think about that company. And it's a positive feeling that they're going to have about that company. If they have forgotten to call, but they meant to call, when they're picking out a Honeycrisp at the grocery store, they're going to make a note. Oh, right, I got to call that company and look into the tubes that they sell. We create positive connections with items in the world related to our company by telling stories, and that means we've built advertising into people's lives without them even being aware that we've done it. So there's a billion ways to add storytelling into business. It's just another one.\n\nLenny (01:02:07):\nYou touched on this two-way approach. One is, you have a problem. Let me think of a story to help me solve this problem, versus I'm going to become a storyteller, come up with this whole brick wall of stories and then I'll deploy them. You said that the first approach is not something you'd recommend. I imagine most people",

One is, you have a problem. Let me think of a story to help me solve this problem, versus I'm going to become a storyteller, come up with this whole brick wall of stories and then I'll deploy them. You said that the first approach is not something you'd recommend. I imagine most people are probably going to be in that bucket like I don't want to be a storyteller. I just want to solve my problems and stories can sometimes help me there. So maybe in that bucket, do you have any advice for how to find a story that somehow helps you with that problem on demand, or is it just like that is not going to work? You're not going to think of a story every time you have some problem?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:02:40):\nI think sometimes you will. I have a company that calls me metaphor man. They call me essentially and say-\n\nLenny (01:02:45):\nI get that.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:02:46):\n\"... we've added a boring feature to our boring platform and we need to make people understand what it does. Will you give us the metaphor we need?\" They don't understand that I'm not really generating metaphors. I am just taking stories from my life, pulling myself out of the story. And if you take yourself out of a story, often what's left is a metaphor, a simile, an example. And then I just offer that to them. And I tell them, if you just use some of my storytelling generating techniques, you could do the same thing. But they're a bandaid company. They just want me to fix things. And I understand that. If you're trying to do it, the best way to tell a story about something that you want people to understand is to do what I call speaking with adjacency, which means we're not going to match content to content. Instead, we're going to match theme, meaning or message.\n\n(01:03:33):\nSo that scientist, for example, he wasn't talking about tubes. He was talking about how people deserve to get what they want in life. His family deserves to get the apples they want, and you as a business deserves to get the tubes that you want. But so often in business what people think is content to content, well, I got to find a way to talk about these tubes to make people understand how important they are. And I say, well, let's not talk about the tubes. Let's talk about something else instead, and then we're going to move what we were talking about over two tubes. We are going to snap it in place. That snap when someone realizes, you were telling me about apples, but really you were telling me about tubes. That snap is so powerful. I use it with students all the time.\n\n(01:04:21):\nA student acts like a fool, gets in trouble sitting at my desk. I'm not talking about their behavior. I'm telling a story that they have no idea why I am telling them the story. They're like, \"I'm in trouble. Why is he telling me about his dog? Why is he telling me a story about his dog when he was 12?\" Because I'm going to snap it into place. Because I'm not talking about content, theme, meaning or message. So when they come to me and they say, \"Here's what we've got.\" I'm not thinking about the thing. I'm thinking about, what is the theme they want to convey or the meaning that they want to convey or the message they want to convey. And what story do I have that will match that or what story can I get out of them?\n\n(01:04:58):\nThe scientist did not come to me with the apple story. The scientist came to me with the tubes and I said, \"Well, it sounds like you're a company that wants to give people what they need. Let's find a story in your life about a time when you have to give people something that they need.\" And we brainstormed it. And when we landed on apples, I knew we had it. Because he was going to be able to talk about, I'm a father. I'm a husband. I'm the husband who takes apple orders from his family before going to the grocery store. I'm going to be able to be funny, because befuddled husbands in grocery stores are always funny. So it wasn't that he came to me with a story. I came to him with the idea of let's look at theme, meaning and message and then snap it over to the tubes. That's what we want to do when we're putting a band-aid on. We don't want to think about what we're talking about. We want to think about the feelings we want people to have about what we're talking about.\n\nLenny (01:05:52):\nAmazing. Okay. So the advice here essentially is you're trying to find a story to tell about something, to help you convince someone of something. You want to think about what is the theme of this problem that I have? What is the meaning behind it and what is the message?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:06:05):\nYeah. Usually one of those. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:06:07):\nAnd then you also touched back on make something in the story relate to something personal about you so that people are like, oh, I'm a runner too. I got to pay attention to this guy. Or I'm shopping. I shop all the time for apples.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:06:18):\nYes. See, so we're stacking strategies, which is a really good thing to do. So we're pulling in all of the things I've talked about and it really makes for a powerful moment for people and",

So we're pulling in all of the things I've talked about and it really makes for a powerful moment for people and a memorable moment. Because the most important thing is that we're becoming memorable. We are in a conference amongst other scientists and we're actually the one who's being remembered.\n\nLenny (01:06:37):\nSo that was the band-aid approach. Then there's the way you recommend it was just build a bank of stories. I imagine this is where the Homework for Life framework you recommend comes from. So maybe let's transition talk about that. Because I think that has a lot of benefits beyond even just coming up with a bunch of story ideas.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:06:53):\nYeah. It's the most important thing that I teach. Whether or not you're ever going to speak in your life. If you plan on being a hermit and going off into the woods and never speaking to someone again, you should be doing Homework for Life regardless. It's a process I came up with maybe 15 years ago now. Essentially when I began telling stories on stages, I fell in love with it immediately, and I got worried that I was going to run out of stories. I saw a lot of storytellers on stages performing, and they would tell the same 6, 7, 8 stories every time, and I didn't want to be that guy. I wanted to have a brand new story every time I took the stage.\n\n(01:07:25):\nSo in a fit of panic, I decided to assign myself homework being an elementary school teacher, it's natural for me to have that inclination. So I just decided every day before I go to bed, I'm going to look back on the day and find one moment that would've been worth telling as a story. Even if it wasn't really worth telling, I was going to write it down. Now I don't write the whole thing down. That's crazy. It's not doable. What I do is I took an Excel spreadsheet, two columns, the date, and then I stretched the B column across. And in that B column, essentially the length of the computer screen, that's where I write my story.\n\n(01:07:59):\nMy goal was I find one new moment per month. 12 new stories per year. That would be amazing. Instead, something far more amazing happens. I discovered that my life is filled with more stories than I will ever have time to tell. And I'm not a unicorn. Thousands of people all over the world are doing the same thing right now and discovering that their lives are filled with stories. Moments like Eileen, which 20 years ago, I would've forgotten that moment within days, and now I've held onto it because it's going to be a Homework for Life moment.\n\n(01:08:29):\nSo I start writing those moments down, and I discovered that I'm developing a lens for storytelling. I see the moments that I did not see before. In fact, I just did some analysis for my new book. In the first year I did Homework for Life I found 1.8 moments per day. So you can find more than one. Eventually I started recording more than one. So 1.8 moments per day. I now find 7.6 moments per day. It's not because my life is more interesting. It's because I have a better lens and I understand what to look for, what to see, and what is worth remembering. So I've become a person who has an endless number of stories like Boris.\n\n(01:09:07):\nBoris does Homework for Life. It's why whenever we meet, he's got three new stories to tell me. And then we work on the stories and then figure out the business applications for them. So it's so important because what we do is we throw our lives away. People say that time flies and it doesn't. What happens is it goes by unaccounted. If you can only remember 89 days of 365 in a year, of course time flies. Because you had 365 and you only remember 89. It's going to feel like it went by quickly. It's not going by quickly, you're just failing to account for each day. And each day has something worth remembering. Homework for Life is the acknowledgement that every single day should have something.\n\n(01:09:48):\nThe prompt that I actually use for myself is this. I say, if someone kidnapped my family and said, \"You can't have them back until you stand on a stage and tell a story about something that happened today, what would you tell?\" That was what I would think in my head every night, and then I would write it down. To be honest, nowadays, I'm not sitting down at the end of the day and writing them all down. I'm recording them as the day goes on. My laptop is around me, my phone is around me. When I hear something. My son says a bit of dialogue I can't believe he just said. I see something for the first time or the last time, or a stray thought enters my mind. I have a new thought that I had not occurred before, all of those become moments for Homework for Life.\n\n(01:10:28):\nNot everyone becomes a story. I did some analysis on this too. About 10% of the things that I write down ultimately either become a story or a part of a story, but the other 90% it's just as valuable. Because I'm holding onto my days. And the other amazing thing that",

About 10% of the things that I write down ultimately either become a story or a part of a story, but the other 90% it's just as valuable. Because I'm holding onto my days. And the other amazing thing that happens is once you start doing this, you'll crack open. And all of the stories that you've left from the past, the ones you've forgotten, they'll start to rise up. They'll bubble up. And I include those in my Homework for Life too as memories. Because once you start looking through the lens of storytelling, you see something like you see Eileen find confidence, and suddenly your brain connects to other students or moments in your life or moments in your children's life, where confidence was an issue and you think, oh, that's right. It's just like that kid.\n\n(01:11:11):\nAnd now I have another moment that I've recovered from the past. A day has returned to me. It enters my Homework for Life, and suddenly I have more stories than I ever have time to tell. And it's not just me. Like I said, thousands of people all over the world, my own children and my students do Homework for Life. And all of them will tell you it's the most valuable thing that you can do.\n\nLenny (01:11:31):\nAnd I think you touched on this. It's not just to collect a bunch of stories. There's a therapeutic element to this too, that you talk about.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:11:37):\nYeah. Absolutely. Many therapeutic elements. First is you're recovering your time and slowing time down, which is beautiful. My kids are 14 and 11. Thank goodness I started Homework for Life just about when Clara was first born. Because they feel 14 and 11 to me. They don't feel like they were just born yesterday, which for a lot of parents, they do. Lots of parents say things like, \"Oh, my God, you're not going to believe what my kids said. I got to write it down.\" But nobody writes it down. You're not going to believe what my kid said is in Homework for Life for me. So I'm holding onto the moments, stretching out time. You also start to do things like you start to see patterns in your life that you don't realize, unless you really think about your life. And I think you should. Storytellers tend to be slightly self-centered in a positive way, meaning we afford ourselves time to think about ourselves.\n\n(01:12:22):\nYou start to see patterns if you start doing this. So I think what I talk about in my book is I always tell people, my wife and I never fight. We've never raised our voices to each other. We really don't ever argue. But I noticed in my Homework for Life a moment when she had asked me to put in the air conditioners before I had central air in the house, and I hated it. I hated it because we agreed to never buy a house without central air. And every year the air conditioners somehow get heavier. I don't understand the physics behind it, but every year it's worse.\n\n(01:12:50):\nAnd she always asks on the 98 degree day, \"Hey, can you put the air conditioners in?\" And there was a day when I was like, \"No, I'm not going to do it. It's really hot.\" And she was like, \"Okay, no problem.\" And then 10 minutes later, I'm in the basement pulling them out, complaining, grumbling, arguing. Only to myself banging them on purpose so she can hear. She's like, \"What's going on?\" I'm like, \"I'm putting in the air conditioners.\" So that becomes a Homework for Life moment.\n\n(01:13:13):\nAnd then a month later, she asks me to mow the lawn, on a 98 degree day. And I said, \"I'm not going to mow the lawn. I'm busy and it's really hot.\" And she goes, \"Okay, no problem. Maybe tomorrow.\" And then I sit for a while and I stew. And then I'm mowing the lawn, but I'm doing it aggressively. I'm running and just angrily mowing the lawn. And when I see these patterns, I suddenly go, \"Oh, I do fight with my wife, on my own.\" I fight in a way that she's not aware I'm doing it. I yell at her through chores and she's not aware that it's even happening. That becomes a story that couples love. They think it's hilarious.\n\n(01:13:48):\nYou also start to see stories that you would've never seen. So it was a day last May when the neighbors to my left and the neighbors to my right came over to the house and had a cookout, the first one of the year. And that was a day when I didn't find anything in the day. I had one moment, which is very unusual for me. And I remember thinking, \"Really, all you got is you had a cookout with the neighbors, that's the best you got?\" It's not even really a story. But it was the best I had so I wrote it down and I moved on. About four months later, the neighbors to our left announced they were getting divorced. It devastated us. Because they have two kids. We've got this big communal backyard with the three houses. Three boys to the right, two kids to the left, friends. Couldn't believe it that they're getting divorced. Known each other since high school. We just never saw it coming.\n\n(01:14:33):\nOne day later, neighbors to the right announced they're getting divorced",

Known each other since high school. We just never saw it coming.\n\n(01:14:33):\nOne day later, neighbors to the right announced they're getting divorced. Left and right within a day of each other. And it becomes a story about how you never understand what's going on in a marriage unless you're in that house. But I don't have that moment in May when there were three couples on a porch, one of them was happy. I thought all three were happy. I don't get that moment unless I'm doing Homework for Life, and I write it down, and now I see a trajectory of a story. I have the opposite. Now I actually have an opposite moment which is I'm serving hot dogs to people I think are happy, but they're only pretending to be happy for our sake. And then they're returning to their homes, to discord and eventually to disillusion of a marriage. So Homework for Life gives you all of that that you don't normally have in life because we tend to live day by day, and we leave that last day behind.\n\nLenny (01:15:27):\nI got tingles listening to that story. For someone that's now motivated to try this. I know there's a template that we'll link to in the show notes where you give people, it's very simple, but I think seeing it will be helpful. But what's something someone could do tonight to start on this process and maybe set a habit to do? How do you actually go about doing this?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:15:44):\nWell, they have to start Homework for Life. And I have a TED talk about it that I go on for 17 minutes about. So I suggest watching it because you'll just get more than what I just told you and I think that's important. And you have to decide to do it every single day, even on the day when the best you have is a cookout. If that's all you got, that's what you got, and you write it down. You have to have some faith too, that it's going to happen over time. Remember, I started with 1.8 and now I'm up to 7.6. And that's over more than 12 years it takes for me to make that jump.\n\n(01:16:12):\nSo in the beginning, you're not going to be very good at it. You're not going to see the right things, and that's just the way it is. If I go back to my original Homework for Life, I see myself looking for stories. And you're not really looking for stories. You're just looking for moments that touch your heart, touch your mind. That's all you're really hoping for. And some of those will become stories. So you've got to start Homework for Life right away. And then if you can just find some people who are willing to listen and begin telling some stories, that's really helpful because most people are unwilling to listen. There's not a lot of good listeners in the world. Everyone says they're a great listener, but active listening is a skill that most people do not possess in any way whatsoever. But if you find people who are willing to listen, you got to start telling stories. You got to start practicing in meaningful ways. And your first stories aren't going to be great. But the good news is most people's stories are terrible. Most storytelling in the world is not very good. So if you put a little thought into what you're about to say, you're going to be better. Because storytelling is not about facility with the language or your vocabulary. It's all about decision-making. That's all it is.\n\n(01:17:14):\nStorytellers are people who think before they speak. They make strategical tactical decisions before they speak. And ultimately, they make enough good decisions to entertain people. Ultimately, no matter what you're doing, whether I am teaching a fifth grader how to behave better, or presenting a new product for a large company, or helping someone deliver an all hands, the first and most important thing you have to be is entertaining. You have to entertain or people will not listen to you. So you got to practice, you got to get reps.\n\nLenny (01:17:47):\nI want to talk about public speaking skills, but just to close the loop on that. So if someone was trying to do this Homework for Life exercises, the idea, would you recommend at night before they go to sleep, open up Google Sheets on their phone and just add something? Is there something else you'd recommend?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:18:00):\nNo. Yeah. That's what I would do. Although ideally, as you go through...\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:18:00):\nNo. Yeah, that's what I would do. Although ideally, as you go through the day, things get forgotten quickly. Your son says something hilarious and by the end of the night you can't remember what it was. So if you can start sort of tracking it through the day a little bit, maybe you make it a habit where at lunchtime you're going to ask yourself what happened that morning? And when you get home from work, you're going to say what happened in the afternoon? And then in the evening you're going to say what happened since then? And then sort of take a whole view of the day and then be open to those memories, allow them to come back. I record them in my Homework for Life as memory, sort of a capital M-E-M-O-R-Y. Because what happens is you start to build up so many homework for life memories that you get confused.\n\n(01",

Because what happens is you start to build up so many homework for life memories that you get confused.\n\n(01:18:39):\nYou're like, what? When did I see a deer? And then I go, oh, that's a story from when I was 14. But you get confused because it's sitting on when you're 38 years old. So you mark them as memories. You hold onto them, you put them into spreadsheets because eventually you're going to want to move that data around and keep track of it in some meaningful way. But yeah, get started today because if you don't, you will lose today. Every day that you don't do homework for life is a day that is going to be lost to you forever.\n\nLenny (01:19:06):\nAnd just very practically, you recommend like Google Sheets, I imagine is what you use?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:19:09):\nI actually use old-fashioned Excel, but yes, Google Sheets would work too, because I started so long ago, right, Excel was the thing I used, and Excel is the thing I still use. I mean, it's backed up in 19 places because it's the most precious thing I have other than my wife and children, cats. But yeah, that's what I would suggest to use.\n\nLenny (01:19:26):\nAwesome. Okay. Just a couple more questions before our very exciting lightning round. In your book, you say that you've only been nervous twice on stage giving a story. Most people, I don't know, is that [inaudible 01:19:36].\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:19:26):\nYeah, that's true. I'm like,-\n\nLenny (01:19:26):\nOkay.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:19:37):\nI can remember the two times. It was yeah, it was PTSD related and Seth Meyers cost of ticket related.\n\nLenny (01:19:44):\nOh, I remember that story.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:19:44):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:19:46):\nOkay. So most people are not like you. Most people are nervous, including me, every single time I get on stage, tell a story. What advice do you give people to help them get better with the nerves of getting on stage and telling a story? Classically, it's the thing people fear most in life.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:20:00):\nWell, the first thing you have to understand is that 98% of your nervousness is actually before you begin speaking. Once you begin speaking, almost all of your nervousness falls away, and that is the experience of most people. So what you're really suffering is from pre-talk nervousness. And when you find that out, that's kind of a relief because if you do it enough. Someone just spoke in the Netherlands, and today I'm waiting to find out how it went. He spoke it for the Florida State Legislature, same topic, and he was really nervous about going into today. He was also really nervous speaking to a bunch of scientists in the Netherlands. But I told him, I said, \"After you began speaking in the Netherlands, once the talk began, how nervous were you?\" And he said, \"Oh, actually, when I began speaking, I was pretty okay. I was incredibly nervous before the talk.\" And I said, \"Well, that makes sense.\"\n\n(01:20:49):\nSo if you own the fact or you believe the fact that, oh, most of my nervousness comes before the talk, but once I start speaking, I'm pretty good. That's really relieving for a lot of people because what we imagine is that we're nervous while we're talking, which is often not the case, particularly if you're kind of prepared, if you know what you're talking about. So be aware that most of your nervousness happens before you speak, and that's a normal thing, and you're just going to have to accept that until some day when perhaps it starts to go away through repetition, through continued performance on a stage. For some people, they're always nervous. I was performing with, I won't say her name, but someone who you have watched on television before, and we were both backstage and I was chatting up the room and she finally said to me, this very famous person, \"Would you stop talking? Because the rest of us are trying to keep information in our head and stay calm.\" I'm a terrible person backstage because I'm always calm, I never care.\n\n(01:21:45):\nSo I have to sort of sequester myself from these people because I torture them. But once she began speaking, all of her nerves fell away. So that's a good thing to know. The other thing to know that's really great is everyone's nervous, except for me. I'm the only monster in the world. So if you're feeling nervous, you're just like everyone else, including a very famous person who you see on TV all the time. That person was nervous, you're nervous, you're in the same camp, right, you're in the same boat. And then preparation is going to reduce your level of nervousness. One of the things that I tell people to do that is most helpful is it's good to practice your talk or practice your pitch, whatever you're doing, but one of the best ways to prepare for it is to record it and listen to it.\n\n(01:22:26):\nListen to it passively, listen to it while your grocery",

What happens is, I really believe this, as you start to listen to it over and over again, it just sort of seeps into your soul, and so it becomes part of you. I have done this technique. I've told a story a decade ago, haven't told it since. Someone hears it on YouTube and says, \"Hey, can you tell that story at our event?\" I say, \"Yes\". I can listen to it once and it comes right out again because I allowed it to sort of sink into my memory in the same way that When Harry Met Sally has sunk into your wife's memory. She can replay that movie in her mind probably perfectly. If you listen to your talk enough, you will get to the point where you can retell it with ease.\n\n(01:23:09):\nThe other thing you can do is some active listening with it. Most people don't forget their talk. They forget the transitions in their talk. So I'm talking about this, but then I got to transition to this, then I got to transition to this. So when I'm listening to my stories or a talk that I'm going to give, I'm playing a game with myself.\n\n(01:23:26):\nSo I'm listening and I go, oh, okay, this is closing out and the next thing I have to talk about is this, and then the next thing I have to talk about is this. And if I don't know what I'm going to, if I'm like, Ooh, what am I going to next? That's where I go, oh, I got to create a mnemonic there. I got to create a bit of memorization there to train myself for that transition. Once you're in a new section of a talk, even if you're following it up a little, you're going to be okay because you're like, oh, I got to talk about the data related to the this or the that. And if it doesn't come out perfectly, you still know what you're talking about.\n\n(01:23:55):\nBut what happens when you're done with the data related to this or that, you go, ah damn, what am I supposed to do next? Right. So we're working on building those transitions. Before a talk or before a story let's say I will do something like I'm going to start in the car and then I'm going to get out into the store, and then I'm going to head out to the parking lot, and then I'm going to be in the park, and then it's three weeks later. I don't tell myself the story. I'm just bouncing between the scenes because once I know the scenes and I know, okay, there's seven scenes, and here they are, and here's the transitions. Again, if I follow up each scene, that's okay because I'm going to get the information out. It might not come out as perfectly as I hoped. You also, if you can avoid memorizing, that'll save you a ton of suffering because memorizers, they're the most tortured souls in the world. So avoid that if all possible. Remember your talk without memorizing your talk.\n\nLenny (01:24:43):\nReminds me, a friend of mine gave a TED Talk and he shared that they give you this advice that people are different kind of learners. Some are audio learners, some are visual. So if you're like an audio learner, listening to it is the most helpful. Some it's seeing the script.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:24:55):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:24:55):\nAnd looking at it,-\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:24:56):\nAnd I'm very much an auditory learner. The other thing though about listening to it is you just get sick of practicing. It gets so frustrating to practice. So at some point you don't want to say it anymore. So rather than saying it, you start to listen to it. You listen to yourself, tell a story about yourself to yourself, which is the most narcissistic thing you could probably do in the world. But even if you're a visual learner, because it's so annoying to practice eventually, I think listening to it can be really helpful.\n\nLenny (01:25:26):\nOkay. Last question is I want to talk about, I mentioned I bring this up, is the power of saying yes, something that you recommend people say yes to stuff versus no. It reminds me, David Sedaris in a, I don't know, Dave Masterclass video or something, said the same thing. He's just like, \"I just say yes to everything because it creates great stories.\"\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:25:41):\nReally?\n\nLenny (01:25:42):\nYeah, it's in his Masterclass talk,-\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:25:44):\nAnd I just finished Sedaris's Happy-Go-Lucky, which is a great book. I love him.\n\nLenny (01:25:48):\nYeah, yeah. So I'd love to hear your advice here for people just to give them a little bit of a final takeaway.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:25:53):\nSure. So I'm going to disagree with Sedaris a little bit. Nah, I won't disagree with him by saying, yes, you do end up with some great stories, but that's not the purpose of the yes. There's actually a book",

So I'd love to hear your advice here for people just to give them a little bit of a final takeaway.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:25:53):\nSure. So I'm going to disagree with Sedaris a little bit. Nah, I won't disagree with him by saying, yes, you do end up with some great stories, but that's not the purpose of the yes. There's actually a book, a storytelling book in the world that I'm not going to mention, and it talks about how to find great stories and it says, go do crazy things and you'll have great stories. I disagree. Fundamentally first, that's a foolish way to live your life. And also some of the best stories I tell, I think the best stories I tell are about tiny moments in our lives where nothing extraordinary happens except everything in our head, right? Most stories that I tell, if you had actually witness the moment of transformation or realization, you would've never known it was happening because most things that happen to us happen in our heads.\n\n(01:26:34):\nIt's not while we're hanging from a cliff, right, for our dear life that we suddenly have a revelation. It's usually like we're walking across a parking lot and suddenly something hits us that's been building up for three weeks, but now it's hit us walking across the parking lot. So the reason we say yes to everything is if you don't say yes, what you're essentially saying is, I am so presumptuous that I understand what's on the other side of that door already even though I've never set foot beyond that door. Right. I just know so much about the world that I know that what's behind that door is not for me. And I think that's foolish and arrogant and full of hubris that is not helping anyone in any way.\n\n(01:27:19):\nSo I say when someone offers you an opportunity, as crazy as it is, as ridiculous, as much as you don't want to do it, which many times in my life, the yeses that I have said about something I did not want to do, but forced myself to do it because of my belief system have resulted in the best and most extraordinary opportunities of my life. A yes can always become a no, right? Yes, I will try that. I step through the door, I give it a try, I spend some time with it. I look around and I say, you know what? Not for me. I step back through and I close the door.\n\n(01:27:54):\nBut so often in life, people don't step through the door. They're too afraid. They've already prejudged the opportunity in some way. They fail to see the benefits of it or the value because they can't see that because they haven't gone through the door. And then there's this ridiculous belief in the world that we're supposed to learn to say no so that we can sort of sequester our time and make it as meaningful as possible, which sounds really terrible to me. The problem is you're going to be 100 someday, and when you're 100, no one is going to be asking you to step through any more doors, and at that point, you're going to look into the past and you're going to say, there were a lot of doors I didn't step through, right, and you're not going to be thinking, I'm so glad I didn't because I allowed myself to stay on the one path that I knew was going to be good for me.\n\n(01:28:46):\nI just think that there is no one good path that's good for you. I think there's a multitude of paths, and they're all great, and a few of them are terrible, but you find out which ones are terrible by stepping through the door, deciding this is not for me and coming back. So I think most of the time people say no because they're afraid. And when someone asks me to do something that scares me, that is when I run to that thing as quickly as possible with all of my might as terrified as I am, because I know that it's the things that frighten me are often the things that are the best for me.\n\n(01:29:19):\nSo we say yes with the acknowledgement that we can say no eventually, but a yes can lead to extraordinary things. And if you watch my TED Talk on saying yes, you'll see that yeses just lead to these extraordinary chains where you said yes to something you didn't want to say yes to, and suddenly it forced you to meet someone who you never would've met, who opened a different door for you. And I mean, the causal chain that you can sort of create by saying an odd yes is extraordinary.\n\nLenny (01:29:47):\nThere was a quote I often come back to around this, which is, \"The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek.\"\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:29:51):\nYeah, that's really good. I mean someone, I do standup now quite frequently. I was just in the New York City Comedy Festival, and I do standup because six years ago, one of my buddies sent me an email saying, \"Hey, we should do standup.\" And I replied to him and said, \"No, I'm not interested in that.\" Hit reply. And then I said to myself, \"Whoa, why did you just do that?\" And I said to myself, \"I'm terrified of it.\" I can tell funny stories and if it's not funny, still telling a story, but if I'm doing standup and I'm not funny, I'm failing. And that's a terrifying thing.\n\n(01:30:24):\nSo I immediately sent a second email that said, \"Okay, I'm in. When are we doing it?\" I have now done standup many, many, many times. That",

That guy who initially asked me to do standup with him has never done it. Not once in his life. He wanted to do it, but he's afraid to step through the door. He's too afraid to do the thing that he challenged me to do that I now do on a regular basis because he challenged me and it's still the thing that probably scares me the most. And therefore, it's the thing that I'm relentlessly trying to do at all times because I know the things that scare me are the things that are the best for me.\n\nLenny (01:30:56):\nAmazing. Matt, is there anything else you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to your very exciting lightning round?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:31:04):\nNo, I've said enough. They've heard enough from me. Let's go to the lightning round.\n\nLenny (01:31:08):\nWe've covered a lot. Let's do it. Well, welcome to our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:31:12):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:31:14):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:31:18):\nOh, so Nathaniel Philbrick's, Heart of the Sea, which is a non-fiction account of the whale ship Essex, which is the origin of the idea for Moby Dick. The sinking of the Essex is what gave Melville the idea for Moby Dick. It's an extraordinary non-fiction account of the whale ship Essex. So that book for sure. If you have children, but even if you don't, because this is one of those children's books that reads well for adults as Kate DiCamillo's, The Tale of Despereaux. It's a young adult novel. It'll take you two hours to read. I've read it 20 times. It is beautiful and extraordinary and fantastic. And then anything by Jessie Klein, she has two books. The only thing I don't like about her is she only has two books. Actually, Sedaris too, Jessie Klein and David Sedaris. Go read those two people too. I'm actually right now reading Bamford's book, the comedian, what's her first name? Bamford. I have Amy stuck in my head for Amy Sedaris. Maria Bamford's memoir right now I'm reading. Also, extraordinary. So there's four that I am now recommending.\n\nLenny (01:32:26):\nAmazing. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:32:32):\nWell, for TV shows I enjoyed The Last of Us, which is based on a video game I've never played in my life. Pretty extraordinary as a TV show, both because filled with stakes. Yeah, it's one of those shows they'll kill anyone at any time. And so you're on the edge of your seat. No one is safe, which is fantastic. And then it has this beautiful bottle episode in the middle of the season, which is one of those things where you're in a zombie TV show, which oddly is unlike any zombie TV show I've ever seen. And then there's a beautiful, fantastic episode. There's another one later on that's sort of very similar. It's just great storytelling in a multitude of ways. It's great. And for a movie, the Barbie movie is better than I ever expected it to be, quite frankly, and is proof positive that you can make stories about just about anything, and if they mean something, it's going to do extraordinarily well.\n\nLenny (01:33:35):\nMy next question, I don't know if it makes sense to ask you, it's usually for product people and founders, but the question is, is do you have a favorite interview question you'd like to ask people when you're hiring? Is there anything that comes up when I ask that?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:33:44):\nI guess I'll say it's the question I like to ask people most often maybe when I'm playing golf and things. I don't like to ask people what they do. I like to ask, how did you get into the job you currently have? It's a dangerous question because occasionally I ask people it and they realize they're in their job for weird happenstances that don't relate to what they dreamed of doing. So I've had two people in my life cry while they answered the question because they suddenly understand, I'm doing this because my sister got me into the company 16 years ago. And I go, \"Oh, well that's great. Is that what you always wanted to do?\" And they say, \"No, it's actually still not what I want to do.\" But I do think that most of the time, how you get a job is more interesting than the actual job you're doing. The answer to that question is more interesting.\n\nLenny (01:34:33):\nYou have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like, whether it's an app or something you bought?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:34:38):\nWell, if you celebrate Christmas for years, I have had an idea on how to design the best Christmas tree stand, and I finally said, someone must've done it. And they did. So I wrote it down for you. It's the Krinner tree stand. The Krinner Tree Genie is extraordinary. It's exactly what I would've designed if I had any ability to design it. It holds up",

My son and I love it because we like hot dogs and it'll put two buns and two hot dogs into the toaster. You pull it down, three minutes later you have a hot dog ready to go. You didn't dirty anything. It's not the best hot dog in the world, but hot dogs are pretty great no matter how they're cooked. So I fully support the Nostalgia Hot Dog Toaster.\n\nLenny (01:36:10):\nThese are amazing selections. There's also call back to our nostalgia trick for getting to be funny.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:36:15):\nRight. That's true. Yes. Unintended, but I'll take credit for it.\n\nLenny (01:36:19):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with friends, either in work or in life?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:36:25):\nYeah, it changed my life really. When I was in fourth grade, a teacher who, and I don't remember which teacher it was, which kills me. I was having a bad day and I was being the way that most people are, frankly. And the teacher said to me, \"Listen, a positive mental attitude will be your key to success.\" And I don't know why it's stuck in my head, but it did. I have said that to myself 100,000 times.\n\n(01:36:48):\nAnd today there's one human being in the world who I think is more positive than me, one human being who I've met, who has more positivity than me. I am a relentlessly positive almost, my wife says offensively positive person. She's like, \"You know what? Some days you can have a bad day.\" And I said, \"I just don't. Because a positive mental attitude is my key to success.\" And it's really the way I frame so much of my life, is looking to the positive, looking to the good. And I do it for people whenever I can. And sometimes it frustrates people. But I really believe that most of life is the mindset that you bring to it. And for me in fourth grade, \"A positive mental attitude will be your key to success,\" for some reason, hit me at the right moment in the right way and has stayed with me ever since.\n\nLenny (01:37:30):\nWhat's interesting about that is it's not even like that well, cleverly put. It sounds like a fortune cookie,\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:37:36):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:37:36):\nYou get and you're like, yeah, sure. But I love that that really had so much impact on you, it stuck with you.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:37:41):\nYeah, I think it was probably timing really. I think I was really having a hard time, and I know at the time two of my friends were not being my friend anymore, and they were my only two friends sort of at the time. And I think I was just open and ready to hear something that I could do to make my life better. And that was the one, and I'm probably predisposed to being an optimist anyway, so it probably landed just right for me.\n\nLenny (01:38:05):\nA positive mental attitude will be your key to success. Amazing. Final question, maybe just to leave listeners with one tactical thing they can do to become better storytellers. What would that be?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:38:17):\nSo two things should start every story you ever tell for the rest of your life. So you start with location, where are you? Location activates imagination, right? If I say I'm standing in the kitchen, you've already automatically applied 1000 adjectives to my story. You see the kitchen with great clarity. You probably put me in your own kitchen or your parents' kitchen or a kitchen you see on TV. But if the particularities of the kitchen are relevant to the story, that's what I want you to do. I'm not interested in reproducing locations with some kind of visual accuracy in your brain. I want you to see a fully realized location. So I love location because it's one word that comes imbued with 1000 adjectives.\n\n(01:38:59):\nSo you start with location and you start with action, meaning something",

So I love location because it's one word that comes imbued with 1000 adjectives.\n\n(01:38:59):\nSo you start with location and you start with action, meaning something needs to be happening right away. Literally, I am in a place and I'm doing a thing. It indicates to the audience that you're actually going to tell something that's moving forward. It's why there's a big spaceship shooting of little spaceship in the opening of Star Wars. It's why there's a police officer chasing a guy across a roof. Something is already happening.\n\n(01:39:27):\nWe didn't start with nonsense. We started with something happening that grabbed us right away. That's what people want from story. Also, if you're a person unlike me, which is to say anyone who isn't sort of a white straight American man with no physical or mental disabilities, who thinks, I've always thought every room I walk into, I have the right to speak. But if you are unlike me in those regards, you often find, and I know this is true, that it's harder to make space, to get people to hear you if you're from any marginalized or discriminated against group in any way. But what I've been told by women and people of color and members of the LGBTQ community, they've discovered that when I start a story by going, I'm in a place doing a thing, it's a signal to people that I am now telling a story.\n\n(01:40:12):\nAnd when you can signal to people, I'm now telling a story, they will get quiet for you and they will afford you the opportunity to speak. I didn't know this was going to be the case, but I have had many, many people who I teach this skill to come back to me and say, \"My God, people listen to me.\" And they've said they think they listen because I tell a good story, but they've told me because I start with that location and action, it just tells people, the movie's on. Nobody talks during the movie. You can eat popcorn, but you're not allowed to talk. It silences the room for you and affords you some space to then start doing the work that a good storyteller does to hold those people's attention. So start every story you ever tell for the rest of your life with those two things, and you're already going to be like 50% better than you were before you heard this.\n\nLenny (01:40:57):\nWow. Well, the hits just keep on coming. Matt, you're much more of a philosopher than I imagined you were when we started this conversation. I learned a ton. I'm really excited for people to learn from you. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more or continue learning from you and work with you potentially, especially companies? And then finally, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:41:17):\nSure. So you can find me at matthewdicks.com or if you're a business oriented person or someone who wants to learn, I also have storyworthymd.com, my initials, MD, and that's where I sort of have courses and online training and things like that. So either place you'll be able to find me and contact me. In a non-self-serving sort of version of your second part of the question, I think if you just tell stories, but more importantly, if you ask people to tell you stories, again, creating that space, listen for people who say things like, oh, something like that happened to me once. What they're really saying is, I wish someone would want to hear what happened to me once.\n\n(01:41:59):\nAnd so I am always someone who's willing to say, oh, tell me that story. Offer someone five minutes of your time so they can finally speak the thing that they've been waiting to speak to someone. So if you just do that, there's going to be more opportunities for storytelling in the world, and ultimately, perhaps that will funnel down to me where they will want to buy my book or visit my website or take some training with me, but just create space for storytelling. I think that'd be a beautiful thing.\n\nLenny (01:42:25):\nI love it. What a beautiful way to end it. Matt, thank you so much for being here.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:42:29):\nThanks so much, Lenny. I really appreciate it.\n\nLenny (01:42:31):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

If you can't, then you should find a buyer and then if you really care about this mission, go and start the next carnation of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):\nOr people that work for you, how have you adjusted what you expect of them to help them be successful?\n\nHowie Liu (00:00:18):\nIf you want to cancel all your meetings for like a day or for an entire week and just go play around with every AI product you think could be relevant to Airtable, go do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):\nOf the different functions on our product team PM, engineering design, who has had the most success being more productive with these tools?\n\nHowie Liu (00:00:33):\nIt really does become more about individual attitude. There's a strong advantage to any of those three roles who can kind of cross over into the other two. As a PM, you need to start looking more like a hybrid PM prototyper, who has some good design sensibilities?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):\nDo you see one of these roles being more in trouble than others? Today, my guest is Howie Liu. Howie is the co-founder and CEO of Airtable. I'm having a bunch of conversations on this podcast with founders who are reinventing their decade plus old business in this AI era, to help you navigate this existential transition that every company and product is going through right now. Howie and Airtable's journey is an incredible example of this, and there's so much to learn from what Howie shares in this conversation.\n\n(00:01:20):\nWe talk about a very interesting trend that I've noticed that Howie is very much an example of, of CEOs almost becoming individual contributors again, getting into the code, building things, leading initiatives themselves. That's something that we call the IC CEO. We also talk about the very specific skills that he believes product managers and product leaders, also engineers and designers need to build to do well in this new world that we're in. Also, how he restructured his company into two groups, a fast thinking group, and a slow thinking group, which allowed their AI investments to significantly accelerate.\n\n(00:01:52):\nIf you're struggling to figure out how to be successful in this new AI era, this episode is for you.

I've been a listener from afar for a while now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:19):\nI'm really flattered to hear that. I'm also very excited. You've been on quite a journey over the last, is it 13 years, is it longer?\n\nHowie Liu (00:04:27):\nYeah, right about 13.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:28):\n13 years.

I imagine there've been a lot of ups and a lot of downs. I want to talk about all those things. I want to talk about a lot of the lessons that you've learned along the way. I want to start with what I imagine was a very surprising down moment in the history of Airtable. This is something that, unfortunately, something I think about when I think of Airtable. I feel other people may feel this way, is there's this tweet that went super viral, maybe a couple of years ago at this point where someone just shared all this data and they're like, Airtable is dead.\n\n(00:04:57):\nThey've raised way more money than they're worth. They're not making enough to get from underwater. Yeah, Airtable RIP. What happened there? How much of that was true? How did that go?\n\nHowie Liu (00:05:06):\nYeah, so basically none of it was true. I mean, the surprising thing to me was how viral this tweet went when ... Frankly, I actually look back at this person's other tweets. I think they worked at CB Insights, and the irony is the whole point of that business is to have good data, good data quality around private company data. And they just literally had incorrect numbers by a strong multiple on what our revenue scale was, what our growth rate was. And if it gave me some consolation, I look back and this person had also tweeted about other companies, like Flexport was the last take-down tweet.\n\n(00:05:45):\nThey have like, \"Oh, Flexport's dead\" and their evaluation is too high, and blah, blah, blah. And so, I think that the more surprising thing was just like this person has been tweeting a bunch of spicy takes that are not substantiated by real data or correct data, and yet this particular tweet went super viral and that was the perplexing part to me. And then, actually, I think what really gave it legs was on the All In podcast, which is obviously super popular. And I listened to it. They covered it. They were like, \"Oh, latest on this week's news, this tweet about Airtable. What do we think about this?\"\n\n(00:06:22):\nAnd it almost, I think became a way to talk about a broader theme of what happens to this last generation of highly valued companies, maybe decacorn companies in this new ... And at that point, it was the recent moment for both public and private markets. They did also issue a correction though. All In, did a follow-up episode, a few, I think weeks later saying, \"Hey, we got the numbers wrong. We are revising our case and a view on Airtable.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:53):\nWhat's that line about how a lie gets around the world some number of times before truth has even this time to get out of bed?\n\nHowie Liu (00:07:02):\nYeah. Well, I think I learned about memes and morality very quickly in that experience. Not a very good social media person, but I think I learned a little more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:10):\nYeah, it's tough. Twitter is such ... The incentives are so misaligned. It's just I tweet something people want to share, not truth.\n\nHowie Liu (00:07:17):\nWell, especially ... I mean, there's a lot to like ... I would say, I like the post Elon Twitter more than the pre Elon Twitter because it is just bolder, and I guess I really admire bold product execution where you're not just stuck to the current laurels and they've made so many changes, but I do feel like I get injected into my feed very sensational content all the time, and I mean, it works on me. I can't help but to click on it and engage with it, but it does ... I think it does result in this kind of content, really spreading.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:52):\nYeah. Now, Nikita running the show, I don't know if you saw this, there's a new ... We don't need to keep talking about Twitter, but there's a new feature where you take a screenshot of a tweet and it has a huge X.com logo watermark on the top, right? Yeah, just to ... People are sharing these tweets all the time. Yeah.\n\nHowie Liu (00:08:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:06):\nMan. Never a dull moment over there.\n\nHowie Liu (00:08:07):\nFor sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:08):\nOkay. I want to go in a completely different direction, something that I'm really excited to talk to you about, which is this very emerging trend that I've noticed that I feel like you're at the forefront of CEOs becoming ICs again. It's kind of this move of, IC CEOs. CEOs getting their hands dirty again, building again, getting in the weeds, coating again. I feel like you're again at the forefront of this. Talk about just why you've done this, why you think this is important, and just what that looks like day to day to you versus what your life was like a few years ago.\n\nHowie Liu (00:08:39):\nThe underlying reason for this shift, at least for me, is that, as we started the company, I was very much in this mode.

I was literally writing code both on the backend, thinking about the real time data architecture of our platform, also the front end, the UX. And I would argue that in that founding moment, the initial product market fit finding, and especially for a product that is pure software, we weren't building an operationally heavy business like a dog walking marketplace where the tech is only an afterthought.\n\n(00:09:11):\nThe tech was the product, right? And in a very Meta sense, Airtable is the platform for other people to build their own apps. So it's all about the attack, like the very intimate design decisions, again, both architecturally and on the front end and the product UX choices. That is the product's value prop. You can't separate those two. You can't say, \"Okay, I researched the jobs to be done. Here's the workflow, here's the process, and then, okay, some engineer can just build it as an afterthought.\"\n\n(00:09:40):\nIt's those little decisions and really be able to be at the bleeding edge of what's possible both in the browser and with the real-time data architecture. That made the product what it was. I think the same is true for Figma, which actually had a very parallel timeline to us. We both were founded around the same time, both spent two and a half years building the product, hands-on that early team before launching. And when I think now to both the era in between that founding moment and then now as well as now the new gen AI moment, I think there was a maturing era of both SaaS overall and Airtable specifically.\n\n(00:10:19):\nWhere, as you scale up and you learn how to build teams and organizations and you have to scale up stuff that's not actually those intimate details, but process and people and so on, you kind of get by default further and further away from those details, right? And maybe for some businesses that's fine because no longer is it about finding the details that make for a magical new product market fit. And it is really just about scaling up an existing thing that works and using what I would call more blunt instruments to scale it up, like a more blunt roadmap, a more blunt go-to market execution strategy.\n\n(00:10:56):\nRegardless, I think that now, we're entering this moment where ... Certainly every software product in my opinion, has to be refounded because AI is such a paradigm shift, it's not even just like the shift from desktop to mobile or on-prem to cloud where that was more like a very one time and somewhat predictable change in form factor. I think AI is so rapidly evolving that with every evolution, every new model release and every new type of capability that's released, it actually implies novel form factors and novel UX patterns to be invented to fully capitalize on those capabilities.\n\n(00:11:36):\nAnd so to be continuously relevant and to refine product market fit in this era, I think you have to be of the details. There is no looking at it from 10,000 foot view and saying, \"Oh, we're just going to throw a bunch of people at this problem.\" It's actually understanding what is the right product experience and the right business model that backs it up and the right ... everything else to support that engine to take advantage of the capabilities in our product domain.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:07):\nYou have this phrase somewhere where you talk about being the chief taste maker.\n\nHowie Liu (00:12:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:11):\nAnd to do that, you have to do exactly what you're describing.\n\nHowie Liu (00:12:14):\nThat's right. I mean, I think that, and I would also say it's actually now also hard to taste the soup without participating in at least some part of creating the soup. Meaning With AI, you can kind of look at the final product and say, \"Okay, this feels right or not, or it feels like we're being bold enough and we're properly productizing these new capabilities.\" But I think to really understand the solution space of what's possible, you have to be in the details.\n\n(00:12:46):\nI mean, literally, you can't just look at screenshots or a pre-recorded video of a new product feature. AI is something you have to play with, and ideally you're playing with both the packaged up app or solution that you've built with it, but you're also playing around directly with the underlying primitives who are using the models either via API or via a chat interface. You're really pushing them to the boundaries. Because that's the only way that you really understand what these new ingredients. It's like as a chef, you just gained access to amazing new ingredients, but you have to actually get comfortable with them to put them into a new dish.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):\nAnd we had Dan Shipper on the podcast, he runs this newsletter and podcast to product a company called Every. And they work with companies to help them become more AI successful and adopt AI and all that stuff. And I asked him, what's the signal that a company will have success adopting AI and seeing huge productivity gains? And he said, does the CEO use ChatGPT or Claude daily?\n\nHowie Liu (00:13:48):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:49):",

And I asked him, what's the signal that a company will have success adopting AI and seeing huge productivity gains? And he said, does the CEO use ChatGPT or Claude daily?\n\nHowie Liu (00:13:48):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:49):\nAnd I feel like you're describing exactly, hourly,\n\nHowie Liu (00:13:51):\nLiterally hourly, or you could even have a measure of inference costs, right? Like the equivalent underlying inference compute cycles, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:02):\nHow many tokens you use?\n\nHowie Liu (00:14:03):\nYeah, I mean, I'm proud to say I am pretty sure I'm still the ... I just checked this recently, but I take pride in being the number one most expensive in inference cost user of Airtable AI, not just within our own company, but I think for a long time I was globally across all our customers vault. I mean, I'm extremely intentionally wasteful. Wasteful in the sense of I'll do something that costs maybe hundreds of dollars of actual inference costs. For instance, doing a lot of LLM calls against long transcripts of let's say, sales calls to extract different types of insights like here's the product apps, identify or here's summaries, et cetera.\n\n(00:14:49):\nAnd we also have now a capability that's basically like an LLM map reduce. So effectively, even if you can't fit the entire corpus of content into one LLM call, because the context window limitations, we'll map through all of this content and break it up into chunks and then perform an LLM call on each one and then perform an aggregation LLM call on those chunks. Very expensive, because you're basically running a highly expensive model against a lot of data and then running it again on the aggregates of that. But for me, hundreds of dollars spent on this exercise is trivial compared to the potential strategic value of having better insights.\n\n(00:15:29):\nIt's as if a really, really smart chief of staff has gone through and read every single sales call transcript that we've had in the past year and giving me very astute product insights, marketing insights, kind of positioning insights and segmentation insights. That's invaluable. You could pay a consulting firm literally millions of dollars to get that quality of work. So to me, I still think the value versus the actual cost of AI when applied greedily but smartly, it's a crazy ratio. And more people should be aggressively throwing compute cycles at these very high value problems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:11):\nUntil somebody tweets how you're costing the company so much on AI compute and you guys are going to be underwater.\n\nHowie Liu (00:16:19):\nI'm just kidding. It's like how we have personally taken down the cashflow profile of the business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:27):\nSo CEO's, founders hearing this, they're probably like, okay, I should probably start doing this. What does this actually look like? I imagine you still have a lot of other stuff you got going on once, you got all these ... How do you change your day to day to do this?\n\nHowie Liu (00:16:41):\nYeah, so I actually cut my one-on-one roster by default, and the idea is not that I don't want to spend time one-on-one with people, but rather that I found that the ... Just having more standing one-on-ones actually precludes me from engaging in more timely topics. I like to think of the best types of meetings as very urgency driven. And there's some timely topic, you've discovered some insight. Maybe I talked to some new startup and I learned something from their product or their approach.\n\n(00:17:20):\nAnd I want to bring that into how we're thinking about a new feature at Airtable or even just plant the seed with some different EPD people within Airtable, I want to make most meetings very timely and very informed by real alpha. There's got to be some kind of value and insight to seed that with. Now, in addition to that, I'll supplement with, when I'm in person with someone, I want to carve out time for a proper catch up and less structured, less timely, and just more of building a relationship with a human.\n\n(00:17:53):\nBut I actually find that having that common .. It's almost a barbell approach where it's like if you're going to spend time with somebody in a freeform way, actually do it in a high quality, not forced weekly ritual way. Go for a longer lunch or coffee walk or whatever in person when you can. Maybe that's a once every month or two kind of thing. And then the in-betweens are either topical, so we do have standing meetings for ... Now, we have a weekly basically sprint check-in on all of our AI execution stuff, which now is half the company or half the EPD org is working on AI capabilities.\n\n(00:18:29):\nWe're trying to ship very quickly, like I basically want to always ask the question, how would an AI native company, like a cursor or windsurf, et cetera, how would they execute? And are we executing as fast as them and taking advantage of all the new stuff as well as them? So bringing that level of intensity and urgency to how I spend my time within, that's been the biggest shift for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:55):\nWhat's a change you've made to help the company move faster and match that sort of pace?\n\nHowie Liu (00:19",

I mean, we did do a reorg of the EPD org. So before we had ... we've gone through a few different reorgs over the past, call it, four years. The original state as we just proliferated, I think by default or incrementally, was that we had a bunch of groups that were each responsible for a feature or a surface area. So there was a group responsible for search within our table, and there was a group responsible for mobile experience and so on and so forth. And that has its benefits. Obviously, that team can go and get really ramped up on that part of the code base, that part of the product.\n\n(00:19:36):\nBut it has the disadvantage of yeah, you tend to think incrementally when everyone's remit is actually a feature that they incrementally improve by definition as opposed to thinking about a mission or a outcome goal that might need to coordinate dramatic changes across a wider set of surface areas instead of just each one incrementally improving. And so, we reorged initially to basically different business units effectively. So I know Airbnb has done the functional to GM back, et cetera. This was more like saying, \"Look, we have an enterprise business\" and them MO there is more about scalability.\n\n(00:20:19):\nCan we support the larger scale data sets and use cases? Do you have the core capabilities needed to be able to push out an app to maybe 10,000 seats or 20,000 seats for product operations? A lot of architecture, a lot of scale, that kind of work. We would have, what we call the teams filler, which is more about self-serve, kind of the product UX, how easy it is to adopt the product on board, share, do all the kind of basic functionality. An AI pillar, solutions pillar, and basically infra. And what we found though with that approach is that there was still ... there was more kind of holistic bets being made.\n\n(00:20:58):\nSo the team's pillar could think not just about one feature, but the overall onboarding experience where really about Nuxt in a way that touched multiple parts of the product, but it still felt like it wasn't ... Especially as we started to execute more on AI stuff, it wasn't allowing us to aggressively and quickly move as a AI native company would. I mean, when you look at the cursors of the world, they're shipping major new stuff every week. And it's not like, \"Oh, well we have this separate roadmap for enterprise, we have this roadmap for this group.\"\n\n(00:21:33):\nAnd it just feels like one cohesive product that's shipping at a breakneck pace. So we did this recent reorg where now we have what I call the fast thinking group, which officially is called AI platform, but it really means we want to just ship a bunch of new capabilities on a near weekly basis. And each of them should be truly awesome value. You should drop your jaw, how awesome it is to use this new capability in Airtable. And then separately, we have the slow thinking group, and that's not meant to be better or worse. It's literally like you need fast and slow thinking in the common sense to operate as a human.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:12):\nI have that book behind me.\n\nHowie Liu (00:22:14):\nYeah, I love that book. But slow thinking it's like, it's just a different mode of planning and executing, right? It's like more deliberate that require more premeditation. We can't just ship a new piece of infrastructure that has a lot of data complexity like our data store HyperDB that now can handle multi-hundred million record data sets. That's not something you ship in a week in a hacky prototype. So we now have these two separate parts of the company, and I actually think what's really cool is they actually compliment each other very well, right?\n\n(00:22:46):\nBecause the fast execution, the AI stuff, that creates the top of funnel excitement that also inspires new use cases and new users to come to Airtable, including in large enterprise, right? Enterprises can use this stuff too. It's not just like a SMB thing, but the slow thinking basically allows those initial seeds of adoption to Sprout and grow into much larger deployments. Whereas I think a lot of the challenge for many of the AI native companies I've seen is that they could have a very wide top of funnel, like get all of this AI, tourist traffic.\n\n(00:23:19):\nA lot of interest, a lot of early usage, but then sometimes the challenge is how do you turn that into more durable growth and get each of those adoption seeds to retain and expand over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:33):\nThat is super cool. I've never heard of this way of structuring teams, the fast thinking, thinking fast, thinking slow, the Kahneman. It's so interesting for the fast thinking team, do you find there's specific archetypes of people that are successful there? Is it a lot of bringing in new people that are not just used to the way of working at our table? What do you find?\n\nHowie Liu (00:23:52):\nWe have a mix. So we brought in ... I mean",

Is it a lot of bringing in new people that are not just used to the way of working at our table? What do you find?\n\nHowie Liu (00:23:52):\nWe have a mix. So we brought in ... I mean, we're always hiring, right? There was never a point in the company's life where we stopped hiring. And candidly, even when we had to do two rifts, that's significantly reduced our head count. We had just way too quickly grown and overscaled the business at a certain point. But even when we did our rifts, we were still actively recruiting and hiring in ... I mean every major department, but especially in EPD, because it's always been my belief that it would be arrogant to say that we have all the people we ever need already in the roster today, right?\n\n(00:24:29):\nWe're always going to need to find new, fresh perspectives, new skillsets, et cetera. And so, we've continued to hire ... I think we've learned as we've gone along of what is the ideal type of hire, and we've done some actual hires and learned from that as well. But I think the fast thinking part, it really just requires a lot of ... Somebody who's able to operate with a lot of autonomy, who's entrepreneurial in nature. Now, it doesn't mean they have to literally be a former founder. I know some companies are, like Rippling for instance, does a lot of actual acquisitions and gets actual founders into the company.\n\n(00:25:04):\nWe found that that's great and we've done some of that as well. But also there are some really, really capable people who we didn't literally have to acquire in, and yet, they're just able to think full stack about the problem and the user experience. Problem, not just meaning the technical layers of the problem, but also, what is the wow factor we're trying to create. So tangibly we're doing this new thing that's about to ship, where not only can you describe the app you want to build and then iterate on it with our conversational agent Omni.\n\n(00:25:41):\nAnd it builds it with the existing air table platform capabilities, but we're also giving it the ability to actually do code gen, to extend those apps with really final mile very bespoke functionality or visuals. So you could say, \"Hey, generate me a very, very specific type of map view with this kind of heat mapping and this kind of icons and ...\"\n\nHowie Liu (00:26:00):\nIt's kind of like heat mapping and this kind of icons. And when you click it, do this. And that's a capability that there's so much ambiguity in some of the design decisions around it. And you have to blend that design thinking with some of the technical constraints of what can the AI models actually one shot effectively?\n\n(00:26:21):\nAnd if not, how do you add in the right human workflow for approval and review, and the reprompting and so on? So just so many different design decisions, and you need somebody who can really think full-stack about that kind of product and is not overwhelmed by that kind of open-endedness, but relishes in it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:38):\nI was actually playing with it before we started chatting. I made a really cute startup CRM.\n\nHowie Liu (00:26:43):\nOh, that's awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:43):\nYeah, started talking Omni over here. It's like the colors are beautiful-\n\nHowie Liu (00:26:47):\n[inaudible 00:26:47].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:47):\n... so that's what's standing out to me right now.\n\nHowie Liu (00:26:49):\n[inaudible 00:26:49] there is...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:50):\nYeah.\n\nHowie Liu (00:26:50):\nI will say just as a note, I consider myself at my core a product UX person. That's my passion. And everything else I've had to learn to run this company is almost like what was a necessary part of the journey. But my real passion is thinking about product UX. And I think of UX in a deeper sense than just the cosmetic design. What you could put into a framer kind of prototype. I think of it as literally what should this product do and how should it represent that and behave for the user? That is the product, in my opinion, right. And of course, then you have to figure out technically what's possible and how to implement it.\n\n(00:27:36):\nBut I think to me what's under executed today in the world of AI products is there's so many awesome capabilities of AI, and most of them are really under merchandise, and there's very poor, actually, visual or otherwise metaphors or affordances given to users to help represent or understand what those underlying capabilities are. I mean, ChatGPT obviously extremely successful product, so not knocking it at all, but you come in and you just get this completely blank chat box by default, and now they have suggestions underneath and so on.\n\n(00:28:13):\nBut the product UX part of me is just craving more visual metaphors or colors or some kind of use the canvas of a web interface and all the richness interaction you create there to better represent or show all the different things that you can do with the underlying model, right. And so that's something we've tried to do with Airtable, is show all of the different",

And so that's something we've tried to do with Airtable, is show all of the different states and use colors even to play those up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:44):\nIt's interesting how much of this connects with I just had Nick Turley on the podcast. He's head of ChatGPT at OpenAI, and he had these two really interesting insights that resonate directly with what you're describing. One is he has this concept of whenever something is being worked on, he's always asking, \" Is this maximally accelerated? How do we move faster? If this is important, what would allow us to move faster?\"\n\nHowie Liu (00:29:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:06):\nAnd I love that that's one of the themes that's coming up as you talk, is just this creating this very clear sense of speed. And you even call it the fast-thinking team, like, \"You are going to move fast.\" And then the other one is just this insight that with AI, you often don't know what it can do and what people want to do with it until it's out. So there's this need to get it out, and that'll tell you what it should be.\n\nHowie Liu (00:29:29):\nI couldn't agree more with both of those, and particularly on the second point, I think it's interesting. Clearly, there have been companies that have both been successful in PLG and more sales-led distribution for AI products. The most notable ones I can think of are Palantir with their AIP deployments. That's obviously very sales-led. You're not PLG into a Palantir deployment. But even companies like Harvey and so on, they're doing very well. And it's primarily, from what I understand, sales-led.\n\n(00:29:59):\nYou're not self- serving into a Harvey instance at a law firm. And yet, to me, the best way to get AI value out there is experientially, right. And so you can kind of get that in a sales motion. You can show a demo. Maybe you can do a POC, but it's so much more powerful when you just open up the doors and say, \"Anyone who wants to come and sign up and trial this product can.\" And I think to me, it's a real proof point that ChatGPT is arguably the most successful kind of PLG product of all time, just in terms of sheer scale of users. Like they announced 700 million... Is it MAUs or week... I think it's actually-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:41):\nWeekly active users.\n\nHowie Liu (00:30:41):\nWeekly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:42):\n10% of humans on earth use it-\n\nHowie Liu (00:30:43):\nThat's insane.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:44):\n... weekly.\n\nHowie Liu (00:30:45):\nThat's insane. In how many years? A few years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:48):\nThree years. Under three years.\n\nHowie Liu (00:30:49):\nYeah. So I mean, literally, that is just the most insane ramp curve. And I don't think they would've gotten there if you couldn't just come in and literally try the product out. And as a little bit of a rebuttal of the point I made earlier where I think ChatGPT doesn't do a ton right now, and even earlier they did even less to expose all the different ways you could use it, but they just made it so frictionless to just try it for yourself that you as a user could come in and just literally ask it anything and see how it did. And of course, people in the early days tried to stump it and showed, \"Oh look, see, it's not that smart. It doesn't answer this hard question really well.\"\n\n(00:31:26):\nBut clearly, the magical nature of it still appealed to you enough. Everybody used it. And so I think I do have a view. We've gone through that whole arc of we started PLG. I'd like to think Airtable was one of the PLG darlings of our era. And anyway, I started moving up market and doing more sales execution, although that was still always on top of usually PLG within an enterprise, but we started doing more and more sales execution. We still have that. That's still really important for our business. But I also think, me personally, one of my goals is to shift my attention back into that kind of builder-led adoption and literally showing in the product experientially, not telling in a deck, the value that you can get from AI and Airtable.\n\n(00:32:20):\nI think that's so key, and it's [inaudible 00:32:23], but it's also more than that. It's not just literally how do you onboard somebody into the product. It's literally thinking about the entire product experience itself, right. And in our case, we just made the entire product experience AI-centric. It used to be that we had kind of this secondary thing that you could ask questions to the assistant sidebar. We now made our agent the default way of doing everything in Airtable, and it's now the Airtable app, as you know, it is almost like an artifact that's manipulated by and can be tool used by the agent",

So if you go to Airtable.com today, it looks like basically all the other AI app building sites. Now it's just tell me what you want to build. Thoughts on that, as just a thing everyone's starting to do is there... what do you think comes next? Is this... Is it working well?\n\nHowie Liu (00:33:15):\nThere's clearly an incredible magic to vibe coding and app building with AI. And this is actually a prime illustration in my view of that concept we talked about a second ago, which is as capabilities of these underlying models evolve, the form factor in the product UX also needs to evolve with it. And so the earliest models, like the kind of original ChatGPT, like GPT-3.5 kind of era models were not nearly as smart as the current models. And so you couldn't really ask it to one shot a more complicated chunk of code, or certainly not like a full stack app, and expect it to work.\n\n(00:33:56):\nAnd so the right form factor for leveraging those models in a software creation context was GitHub Copilot, right. It's like auto-complete a few lines of code at a time. But you couldn't chat to it and tell it, \"Build me this entire app from scratch.\" And I think that as the models got better and better, you saw that the new form factors emerge. I think Cursor did a great job of being an early pioneer of this more age agentic way of leveraging the models to do more complex things and generate more larger chunks of code.\n\n(00:34:27):\nAnd now with Composer, you can literally just go into Cursor and build an app from scratch, build me a 3D shooter game from scratch, and just watch it go and create all the files and fill out each file, and then the thing actually runs some of the time. And so to me, this is where the world is going. The models are clearly getting smarter. And if you think about the original vision of Airtable, it was always about democratizing software creation. We just strongly believed that the number of people who use apps far outweighs the number of people who can actually build their own or manipulate apps and harness custom software to their advantage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:08):\nThat sounds very familiar, very familiar these days.\n\nHowie Liu (00:35:10):\nYeah, exactly. And so I think this is, it's a different means to the same end. And so it's almost like we have to lean into this because if we started Airtable today, this is what we would be all in on. Now I think that the advantage that we have, and I do think you have to be realistic to yourself, especially as a company that predates GenAI and now has to find your new footing in the AI landscape. You can't fool yourself and just say like, \"Okay, I'm going to throw in some AI stuff on the landing... on the marketing site, put in a couple AI features, and call it a day.\"\n\n(00:35:43):\nI think you actually have to take a clean slate approach to saying, \"How would our mission best be expressed? If you were literally founding a new company from scratch with the same mission, how would you execute on that mission using a fully AI native approach?\" And then, by the way, do you have useful building blocks that you can leverage from your existing product and your existing business, or are you literally worse off having this legacy asset versus starting something from scratch? And I don't think the answer is always yes or no. I think it just depends on the product.\n\n(00:36:19):\nAnd if you can't really introspect and say, \"Look, I think I'm better off doing this with the pieces that I have for my existing business and product,\" then I think you should sell. You should find a buyer for that company and then go. And if you really care about this mission, go and start the next carnation of it. In my case, I really thought about this and really feel strongly that the building blocks that we have, these no code components, actually do allow us to execute better on this vision than if I had to start from scratch.\n\n(00:36:50):\nMeaning the problem with vibe coding, especially if we're building business apps... So I should clarify that we want to democratize software creation, but specifically, we are focused on business apps. We're not trying to be the platform where you create a cool viral consumer game. This is for like your CRM, right. Or if you want to build an inventory management system as a small restaurant or a lawyer trying to build a case management system, that's what we've always been focused on. And I think in this AI-native world, clearly, you should be able to generate those apps agentically.\n\n(00:37:24):\nAnd yet if you have an agent that has to generate every single bit of that app from scratch, from code, it's going to be very unreliable. There's going to be bugs. There's going to be data and security issues. And then you're also going to have a context collapse, as it just cannot manage all of the code that it's written, basically, as the app gets more and more",

There's going to be bugs. There's going to be data and security issues. And then you're also going to have a context collapse, as it just cannot manage all of the code that it's written, basically, as the app gets more and more complex. And what we actually have are basically these primitives that the agent can manipulate and use without having to literally write the code from scratch to represent, \"Here's a beautiful crud interface on top of the data layer.\n\n(00:37:57):\nOurs is real-time and collaborative, and really rich, and has collaboration on it. And by the way, here's all these other view types and a layout engine for a custom interface, a layout, or automations and business logic.\" And so it's almost like in programming terms, the Airtable pieces in our Lego kit today can be used by this agent as almost like a more expressive DSL, like a domain-specific language to build business apps instead of literally having to write everything down to the SQL and HTML and JavaScript to build every part of that app from scratch.\n\n(00:38:31):\nAnd so if we can combine the best of both worlds, we have these very reliable, high-quality Lego pieces. Now, an agent can go and assemble them for you instead of you just using the GUI to do that. And by the way, if you do want to fall back to the GUI, there's a really great kind of way for the non-technical user to still understand and participate in what's going on. Whereas if you're not technical, you can't inspect the code underneath a v0 or Lovable or Revolut app, right.\n\n(00:38:58):\nIt's just kind of opaque to you. And if you can't re- prop it to get what you want, you're kind of stuck. This is much more akin to a developer using Cursor can generate lots of code, but then can still drop back to the IDE to edit and manipulate it to the final production-ready state. So that's kind of the play that we're making. And if I didn't fully and truly believe we have a better shot at doing it with our existing product, I wouldn't be running this company in its form today.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:25):\nI'm talking to a lot of founders that are going through the journey are going on, which is, \"We've had a business for a decade, AI emerged, and wow, we got to figure out something that works... that could work even better.\" And so I'm trying to pull out the threads that are consistently working across these journeys because I think a lot of companies are trying to figure this out. So one that you just touched on is just if you were to start today, what will you do?\n\n(00:39:48):\nWhat would that business be? Plus, how can... do we have an unfair advantage with the thing we've done in the past? That feels like an important ingredient. And then the other... circling back to stuff you've shared already, there's just creating a sense of urgency and pace and getting people to understand this is how things move in AI, and we need to create this fast-thinking team. I love that metaphor in framing.\n\n(00:40:11):\nAnd then there's the point you made about just talking to AI regularly as the founder feels like an important element, just like to truly be this ICCO talking to AI, working with AI regularly. Just on that note a little bit more, just to give people a sense of what this looks like day to day. So you're talking to Omni all day trying to and undertook... flex the power of what you can do and iterate on it. Is there anything else you're doing day to day that helps you figure out what to do for the business?\n\nHowie Liu (00:40:38):\nOne, I try to use as many different AI products, including not Airtable, as I can, and both literally for the novelty factor and just some new cool demo comes out. Like Runway release their immersive world engine, and so I'm going to go try it out. When Sesame AI put out their cool interactive voice chat demo, I tried that out because even though we don't have a direct and near-term need for really realistic and interruptible voice mode where it's not as core to our capabilities, I just want to understand and get a feel for everything that's out there.\n\n(00:41:23):\nAnd I try to invent little, almost like side projects of my own, to have a real reason to use these products. Like, \"Oh, cool. What if I were to take... What if I were to try to create a funny little short... a funny video short using a combination of HeyGen avatars with a script, like a comical script generated by AI? And maybe it'll be on an interesting topic. So I'll do deep research on the topic with ChatGPT and pull together the results, have it compose kind of a little dialogue.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:58):\nDid you actually do this? Is there something you made?\n\nHowie Liu (00:42:00):\nYeah. That's literally an example of something, just a fun weekend project. And to be honest, these things only take you an hour if you become kind of pretty proficient with using the products. They're all so easy to use. You can literally do the deep research thing, kick off query, make a coffee, come back in 20 minutes. Okay, let me prompt it to generate me some dialogue. It's a little bit like what NotebookLM does for you out of the box, but sometimes I like to",

It's a little bit like what NotebookLM does for you out of the box, but sometimes I like to just do it myself. And then, okay, let me take the script and cut it up and turn it into a HeyGen avatar and then download the video and play it.\n\n(00:42:32):\nAnd just for fun. I'm not trying to make that into an actual YouTube video business. But I think coming up with these different fun weekend projects is a really useful construct to force myself to actually try these products in a more than just a Twitch click way. And what it gives me is, A, it's not just understanding the models, which is also very, very important, right. GPT-5 came out yesterday, and playing around with it a bunch just on a variety of different personal use cases, but there's a difference between just understanding the model but then also understanding the product form factors in which they can be placed, right.\n\n(00:43:15):\nMeaning when you apply the model in a more structured way, when you apply the model with different tool calling than maybe what ChatGPT has in its out-of-the-box form, when you apply it with a more agentic workflow, again, that might be different from what ChatGPT gives you out-of-the-box, that's when you kind of learn you really get to inspire yourself on what are the product's form factors that these new models can take. And plus, by the way, I find it to be really fun. There is to me a delight and entertainment value to just using AI, period, because A, it's not perfectly predictable.\n\n(00:43:57):\nSo I think the element of you're not quite sure what you're going to get. It's like a box of chocolates. And B, it always blows my mind just to think about, \"Wow, five years ago we didn't have any of this stuff.\" AI was like, okay, it's like we can do predictive analytics. There's some basically very advanced kind of regressions that we could run with AI, but it looked nothing like this in its current form, and it's just actually super fun, in my opinion, to get to play around with all the different types of products that come out.\n\n(00:44:33):\nI think that is a big part of it because on the point about the pace of the world moving so much faster in AI than any other landscape in SaaS, in the mature SaaS era, it was important to study your competition. If you were building a SaaS company, you'd be crazy not to follow Salesforce every year and see what the major releases they're putting out are, or ServiceNow, or so on.\n\n(00:45:03):\nThis is the equivalent of that, but there's major new releases and products and so on every week, not every year. And so I just think you have to say abreast of all... of it all and combining this with our point earlier of a lot of this has to be experienced, not just read. You can't just read the write-up on TechCrunch or even a tweet about a new capability. You kind of have to try it to really get a sense of what it is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:33):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Anthropic, the team behind Claude. I use Claude at least 10 times a day. I use it for researching my podcast guests, for brainstorming title ideas for both my podcast and my newsletter, for getting feedback on my writing, and all kinds of stuff.\n\n(00:45:49):\nJust last week, I was preparing for an interview with a very fancy guest, and I had Claude tell me what are all the questions that other podcast hosts have asked this guest so that I don't ask them these questions. How much time do you spend every week trying to synthesize all of your user research insights, support tickets, sales calls, experiment results, and competitive intel? Claude can handle incredibly complex multistep work.\n\n(00:46:13):\nYou can throw a hundred-page strategy document at it and ask it for insights, or you can dump all your user research and ask it to find patterns. With Claude 4 and the new integrations, including Claude 4 Opus, the world's best coding model, you get voice conversations, advanced research capabilities, direct Google Workspace integration, and now MCP connections to your custom tools and data sources.\n\n(00:46:34):\nClaude just becomes part of your workflow. If you want to try it out, get started at Claude.ai/Lenny. And using this link, you get an incredible 50% off your first three months of the pro plan. That's Claude.ai/Lenny. For people that work for you across Airtable, say the product team, PMs, maybe engineers, designers, how have you adjusted what you expect of them to help them be successful in this new world?\n\nHowie Liu (00:47:02):\nOne is really, really, really stressing this idea of go play with this stuff. And I mean, when I say play, I really mean play in the psychological sense of there's a difference when you go in and you're kind of just trying to check the box and get a job done. There's a difference when you come in with a curiosity and you're kind of exploring, right. And it's both more fun and energizing, but also, I think you learn more through that. And so I've really tried to stress the value of play",

And so I've really tried to stress the value of play with these AI products.\n\n(00:47:36):\nAnd I kind of try to lead by example, by literally going and sharing out links or screenshots of the things that I'm doing in these various products. So, as an example, I will go into one of the prototyping tools and show, \"Hey, I built a marketing landing page for this new capability we're launching.\" I created a landing page for it in Replit, let's say, and now I'm sharing that link. Instead of what typically we would've done in the past is like, okay, we're going to write a doc about it and then share the doc, I'm just going to show you an actual landing page with visuals and everything in there.\n\n(00:48:20):\nOr I'll share the actual link to my deep research reports. Or instead of me writing a perfect memo on a topic, I'll actually just prompt my way into getting a chat thread or a chat output that basically covers all the content that I care about and maybe even ask it to, \"Okay, summarize this all into a final memo output,\" and then intentionally share that rather than expose the fact that I'm using AI in this way and here's literally how I'm prompting it so you can follow along as well.\n\n(00:48:49):\nBut really trying to encourage everyone to go and just play with these products. And I've even said, \"Look, if anyone wants to just literally block out a day or frankly even a week and have the ultimate excuse, you could use... you could say that I told you to do it, right. If you want to cancel all your meetings for a day or for an entire week and just go play around with every product, AI product that you can find that you think could be relevant to Airtable, go do it. Period. So I think that's the most important thing is this play, this experimentation.\n\n(00:49:25):\nI think there's also a lot of other kind of shifts in how we execute prototypes over decks. I want to see actual interactive demos because, again, it's hard to... In a deck or in a PRD, you could say, \"Okay. Well, we're going to make Omni really good at handling this kind of app building.\" Okay, those are just words. The real proof is in the pudding of like, \"Okay, let me try it out on a few realistic prompts that I can imagine.\"\n\n(00:49:49):\nAnd in a demo, in a real prototype, you can instantly try it out on unrealistic rather than golden pathy scenarios and see how it feels too. Does it feel too slow? Do we need to expose more of the reasoning or steps that are happening behind the scenes? Create a progress bar or something like that. But it's really hard to get that feel of the product with anything but a functional prototype that really does, in an open-end way, use the AI to do whatever you put in.\n\n(00:50:24):\nSo I think it's more like a experimentation playground it feels like how we need to execute, versus I think, in the past, it sometimes felt like a more deterministic resourcing and kind of timelines view of execution. We're going to put this many people on this problem, and this is the eight-week timeline to this milestone, and then we're going to ship in a quarter from now. And I think now the whole thing is just a lot more experimentation and iteration-driven.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:56):\nOf the different functions on a product team, PM, engineering design, who has had the most success being more productive with these tools, and how do you think this will impact each of these three functions over time?\n\nHowie Liu (00:51:07):\nWhat I found is that it really does become more about individual attitude and maybe some polymathism. There's a strong advantage to any of those three roles who can kind of cross over into the other two, like the hybrid unicorn types.\n\n(00:51:26):\nSo if you're a designer who can be just technical enough to kind of be dangerous and understand a little bit of how these models work and how does tool calling work and all of this stuff, then you can actually design a concept or even prototype a concept, including in these prototyping tools that's much more interesting and maybe realistic than if you're just stuck in the flat like let me put something in a static design concept because I think designs have to be more interactive. The whole... The value of the product and the [inaudible 00:52:04]-\n\nHowie Liu (00:52:01):\n... the value of the product and the product functionality is in the interaction of it, right? Think about the design of Chachi Petite. Again, it's the most basic design you could possibly imagine. The real design actually is happening underneath the hood in how it responds to different queries and what happens after you fire off a prompt, right? So I think I found that there are people within each of these functions, there are engineers who are very good at thinking about product and experience and can go and prototype out the whole thing. They're designers who can do the same. Even if they can't literally code, they can prototype something out literally using a prototyping tool.\n\n(00:52:42):\nI think that's where AI tooling is also giving more advantage to people who can think in",

Then PMs as well. I think there are some PMs who are really getting into the technical details and studying up on how does this stuff work and actually getting hands-on, rather than seeing the role as writing documents, writing PRDs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:08):\nDo you see one of these roles, I don't know, being more in trouble than others, just like you need fewer of these people in the future potentially?\n\nHowie Liu (00:53:16):\nI think overall you can get more done with fewer people, and that's not to say we want to go and make the team smaller, but rather ... the really cool thing for us and I think a lot of other companies is it's not like you have a finite set of things you need to do and execute on from a product standpoint, and okay, now I can do that with a 10th of people. I mean, you could do that in a lot of cases, but for us, maybe it's also because we're a very meta product, right? We are the app platform with which you can build now any AI app with AI, right? The apps themselves leverage AI capabilities at runtime, whether it's to generate imagery for a creative production workflow or leveraging deep research, or AI-based crawling of the web to search for companies that match a certain criteria for your Dealflow app or something like that.\n\n(00:54:10):\nWe can effectively leverage all of these other AI capabilities in this app platform, because by definition we're enabling our customers to build apps that have this wide range of AI capabilities. But because of that, it's like we have a almost infinite set of possible AI capabilities that we could execute on, right? I'm always telling the team like, \"Look, the great news is it's like we have all these fruit trees and there's so many crazy low-hanging fruit, and you've got literally massive watermelons literally sitting on the ground and all you have to do is walk over 20 feet and pick it up instead of having to climb the really tall coconut tree to grab a hard coconut from 50 feet up. So there's so many watermelons on the ground, just go out and start finding the biggest ones and attacking those, right?\"\n\n(00:55:03):\nWhat that means is that if we can build this culture, and I do think it's a learnable way of operating, I really like to believe in the growth potential of any human and any individual. I think if you really have a growth mindset, and that's why one of our most important core values is growth mindset, right? If you really have that growth mindset, I think especially if you're willing to put in the nights and weekends hours, or in my case I'm literally telling people like, take a full day off, take a full week off and learn this stuff, you can become more fluent in this way. I think then what we get is a team that can just go and work on more things in a much more leveraged and fast way, right?\n\n(00:55:48):\nSo, I like to think people who are willing to jump on the train are just going to become more and more effective. It's not like, oh, as a PM my role is becoming entirely irrelevant, right? No, it means that as a PM you need to start looking more like a hybrid PM prototyper who has some good design sensibilities. By the way, I think some of the best eng PM and design cultures respectively over the past even few decades have always been multidisciplinary in nature, right? The original PM spec at Google required the PMs to actually be somewhat technical so they could understand the engineering limitations of the product designs they wanted to make, and they had to be kind of designy, right?\n\n(00:56:33):\nI remember my co-founder, Andrew, when he was in the APM program was always reading books about design, even down to visual design and color theory and that kind of thing, right? So I think it's just a reminder that designers as well, some of the best designers through designer to Apple, including hardware designer, you have to understand some of the technical capabilities of how this stuff works, right? If you're an engineer, I think some of the best engineers and maybe Stripe always had a very good engineering culture of engineers who could think about the product and business requirements. In fact, on any given product group, at Stripe my understanding is that the DRI isn't always the PM as is traditionally the case in that triangle. Sometimes it's actually the engineer who's taking the product lead and saying, this is what we need to build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:24):\nSo, what I'm hearing is essentially the trend across product engineering design is each of those functions needs to get good at one of the other functions at least.\n\nHowie Liu (00:57:35):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:35):\nIdeally you can do them all, but if you can just do one additional, so a PM becomes better at design, an engineer becomes better at product management.\n\nHowie Liu (00:57:43):\nWell, I would actually go further and say I think you need to get decently",

There's just a minimum baseline of if you're any one of those roles, you need to be minimally good at the other two, and then you can go deeper into your own specialty, right? You could be a designer who's really good at thinking about UX and interaction design, and then just good enough to be dangerous on thinking about what's technically possible and what is the product story around this feature.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:17):\nI love that. To do that, one piece of advice that comes up again and again in what you've been describing is use the tools constantly to see what's possible, and that will teach you a lot of these things.\n\nHowie Liu (00:58:28):\nI think, well, use the tools gives you exposure to what's possible, right? It's kind of like if you wanted to be a great industrial designer, and let's say, I mean, the chair is the ultimate hello world of industrial design, it's the canonical design object, you wouldn't just sit there in a vacuum with no familiarity with the materials that you can use, plywood, steel, whatever, or existing form factors of chairs trying to invent the world's best chair in a vacuum, right? You should go and first do a study of all of the best chairs out there today. Go look at an Eames chair, sit in it and try to examine it to reverse engineer how it was made, and just look at the prior art for that type of product. That's how I see the go out and play with these products, and also, I think actually going and designing or implementing or executing is the best practice.\n\n(00:59:21):\nSo you can't just only go and look at other people's chairs, eventually you have to go and actually try building your own and then try building another one and another one and another one. So, I think that's where ... when I think about how I hone my own product UX sensibilities, I never ... and at that time that I was in school and then learning about this stuff, there wasn't really any good curriculum for UX, right? It's not like there were great college classes to learn product UX. I mean, even CS was very academic in nature at that time, it wasn't applied software engineering, like build an app or whatever. Maybe now at some of the schools like Stanford, MIT, they have actually UXy type courses, but it's still a rarity for most people to have access to that.\n\n(01:00:03):\nSo, the way I learned all of my product sensibilities was just trial and error and also using and studying other products, and then going and trying to build my own weekend project ideas, right? Oh, I want to build a Yelp style app with a map view and then also a list view, and I want it so that when you pan around in the map for it to automatically update the list view. Maybe there's some UX improvements I can make on top of that, but I can also test my technical skills to figure out which parts of this are hard to implement and how do you make it work, and what are some of the design changes or affordances that you can use to map to the technical possibilities.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:43):\nTo do that, I loved your piece of advice, which I forgot to double down on, which I also find really powerful. The best tip there is find something to actually build that is useful to you and fun. Pick a project that's like, okay, this would be fun to do. Have a problem you're solving that forces you to actually do this thing.\n\nHowie Liu (01:01:00):\nFor sure. Look, I think that can be night and weekend projects, it can also be the daytime job projects, right? I mean, I am basically telling our teams on the AI platform group especially, \"Look, in that low hanging fruit metaphor, it's like I'm not being prescriptive with you on which watermelons you should pick, but you should go ...\" We do have different pods within that group, but one of them for instance is what we call the field agents team and they're responsible for the agents that work within your app. So this is not the agent that builds your app, but these agents that run on a customer's behalf to do web research on your customers, or they can go and analyze a document and in the future maybe do things like actually generate a prototype of a feature from a PRD or from a feature idea.\n\n(01:01:52):\nI'm telling them, \"Look, there's a almost infinite number of superpowers you can give these field agents. I'm not going to tell you which specifically to do. Now you can ask me to weigh in for sure, but you should go and just experiment and prototype a few different directions we could go.\" What if you prototype what it would look like to have a deep research implementation in field agents, so that for any given row of data, let's say in your case it's podcast guests, you can just click a button or click a button en masse across every speaker you have lined up to do deep research powered by ChatGPT's own deep research on each of the speakers and have them all laid out side by side in this table, right? Go prototype that and see how it feels and looks like. So I think some of this stuff can also",

The problem I ran into, I wonder if it's changed, is there's no API for ChatGPT deep research yet as far as I know.\n\nHowie Liu (01:02:55):\nThere is now, there is now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:56):\nThere is, there we go.\n\nHowie Liu (01:02:58):\nSometimes it ends up being ... and I think they only recently exposed it. It ends up being something on the order of a dollar plus per research call, which-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:05):\nWhat a deal.\n\nHowie Liu (01:03:05):\n... I mean, again, exactly. I mean, some people would say, oh my god, that's so expensive, and you rack up 50 of those, you've cost $50 a month. I think it's like, well, it just saved you hours of research by a human.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:16):\nNot only that, I actually have a researcher that I pay to give me background on guests that was four or 500 bucks and the dollar sounds great. I've been doing this-\n\nHowie Liu (01:03:28):\n[inaudible 01:03:28]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:28):\n... I've been doing this manually.\n\nHowie Liu (01:03:29):\nIf he was being smart he would be using deep research and they just collected [inaudible 01:03:33]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:33):\nThey might be. They might just be. Oh, man. Okay, there's one more skill I wanted to talk about real quick. This comes up a lot in these conversations is evals.\n\nHowie Liu (01:03:43):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:43):\nThe power of getting good at evals, I know that's something you value highly. Talk about just why you think this is something people need to get good at.\n\nHowie Liu (01:03:50):\nYeah, and I listened to your episodes with [inaudible 01:03:54] and Mike who talked about this. I think it's interesting that both heads of OpenAI and Anthropic have converged on this point. I mean, look, I think I would add a slightly different or additive take though, which is I think for a completely novel product experience or form factor, you should actually not start with evals and you should start with vibes, right? Meaning you need to go and just test in a much more open-ended way, like, does this even work in kind of a broad sense?\n\n(01:04:28):\nSo as an example, for our custom code generation capability, instead of defining evals that get repeatably tested as you vary the prompt or the model or the agentic workflow used to generate these outputs, and you have to define what does good look like by definition for the eval, I would first start with a much more open-ended and ad hoc style of just throw stuff against the wall, try different prompts and see how well it does.\n\n(01:05:01):\nTo me, evals are more useful, A, once you've converged on the basic scaffold of the form factor and you kind of know what are the use cases you want it to work well for and what you want to test against it. Whereas in the early days, especially if your product market fit finding either for an entirely new company or for a pretty dramatically new or bold new capability that doesn't really have ... it's not an incremental improvement on something that exists in Airtable today, I think you have to just be a little bit more creative initially and throwing stuff at it, seeing what works to understand, okay, let's use an example, we're implementing this new capability that can use basically a long-running AI crawler agent that goes and researches the web for a specific type of object or entity, right?\n\n(01:05:55):\nSo it's similar to deep research, but what it actually does is instead of outputting a report, it's actually going and compiling a list of things. The things could be companies or people or anything else, right? Find me every Marvel movie ever made, find me every DC Comics spin-off series, literally anything. You have to go in and first just try out a bunch of random ... use your own brain to think of what's the range of use cases I can test this against, right? Then you get back some results and you're like, okay, well, it's clear that where it does really well are these types of searches, people and companies with this kind of parameter.\n\n(01:06:42):\nI think to me, evals are useful once you have a sense of what is that cluster of useful use cases, you can start then more programmatically measuring the changes that you're making to improve the output for that, right? But by that point, you've probably already scoped the product and maybe the way we would merchandise it in Airtable is not a completely open-ended capability, but hey, here's",

But by that point, you've probably already scoped the product and maybe the way we would merchandise it in Airtable is not a completely open-ended capability, but hey, here's a specific capability that can research one of these X number of entity types including people and companies, and here's even the filter conditions or criteria that are more explicit that you can define to give it the prompting to search for that thing, right?\n\n(01:07:25):\nBut I kind of think it's more useful as a way to iterate your way to improvement, and you can start really testing stuff empirically, right? You can A/B test, especially if you have the scale of a really large product like Anthropic or OpenAI, you can just test everything and see like, oh, this model actually performs better than this one, this prompt performs better than this one, but I think early on you don't have that luxury and you're in a much more open-ended discovery process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:51):\nThat is very wise, evals could constrain you too early. I think about just the Double Diamond, I don't know, IDO framework of be divergent first, and then converge and then maybe-\n\nHowie Liu (01:08:01):\nYeah. Yeah, exactly. I hadn't heard that before, but that completely resonates.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:06):\nOkay, let me try to reflect back some of the advice I've been hearing about how to shift a company to be successful in this new world, and let me see if I'm missing anything that you think is really important. So, one is there's this sense of just reset the expectations on pace and urgency and help people understand in AI things move incredibly fast, this is how we need to operate. Then there's also a piece of get stuff out so that you can learn how people use it and what it's capable of versus polishing it endlessly. Forcing people almost ... I don't know if forcing's the right word, but encouraging people to play with the latest stuff and giving them a chance to take days off or block out calendars, cancel meetings, just stay on top of this stuff to play as you talked about it. Then sharing things they've learned, get the vibes of what's possible.\n\nHowie Liu (01:08:54):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:55):\nThere's also this idea of just rethink, okay, if we were just start today in this world, what would we do to achieve the same mission we are trying to achieve? Ideally it leverages this unfair advantage we have with things we've been working on for a long time. Then there's just talk to AI constantly every hour as you described.\n\nHowie Liu (01:09:16):\nFor sure. Yeah, multiple times an hour, if possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:16):\nMultiple times an hour, it keeps going up. Is there anything else that I missed there that you're like, you need to do this too to have a chance?\n\nHowie Liu (01:09:25):\nI think just to really, really try to break down role silos, and I think that's true certainly for EPND in the typical EPD triangle, but I also think it's probably true even for non-product roles, right? I think it's true in marketing, right? Something I'm really pushing for in marketing and I think our marketing team is really leaning into actually is if you can just do all of the thing yourself ... traditionally how a marketing team might operate is like, okay, you have one person who's responsible for executing the performance marketing part of a campaign. They literally go into the Google AdWords interface and they're tweaking the parameters of targeting and budget and conversion tracking, et cetera, and then somebody else is actually responsible for coming up with the specific ad copy, and somebody else yet was responsible for coming up with the seed content or positioning guide written by a PMM that feeds into the ad creative, and so on and so forth, right? Maybe they're promoting some new demo asset that somebody else yet created.\n\n(01:10:35):\nI just think that in the same way that you can collapse the roles in EPD, and the ideal person, maybe they're very specialized and deep in one dimension like engineering, but they're well-rounded enough to be dangerous on the other two, I think that's kind of true in almost every other function, right? Sales as well, I think you should start to be able to play more of an SE role. Traditionally salespeople didn't necessarily know the product that well and relied on the SE to come in and be the product experts. I think it's really hard to sell any kind of AI product now without actually being fluent in the product and be able to demo the product, so AEs need to be SE fluent as well.\n\n(01:11:21):\nSo I just think that that concept of collapsing roles, everybody needs to become more full stack to do the ... being more outcome-oriented, right? Your outcome as an AE is to convince customers of the value of your product and close deals, right? Okay, well, in order to do that, you used to have dependencies on having assets created by marketing and an SE to help you demo. Can you collapse more of those dependencies so that if you had to, you could do it all yourself, right? I just think it's a new operating mentality overall for every AI native company or company that wants to compete in this new arena.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:",

I just think it's a new operating mentality overall for every AI native company or company that wants to compete in this new arena.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:06):\nThat is a great addition. It almost feels like you go back to startup times when everyone's doing a bunch of stuff. There's no here's the head of product, here's the head of engineering, we're just doing stuff-\n\nHowie Liu (01:12:06):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:16):\n... that needs to be done.\n\nHowie Liu (01:12:17):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:18):\nYeah, I'm kind of seeing it as this upside down T where there's the thing you're really strong at and then as you described, the minimum of being good at engineering design or ... and SE, by the way, sales engineering imagine is what that stands for. Adjacent roles, you need to start having a baseline. The baseline is increasing of how much you need to understand that, everyone's Venn diagrams are kind of converging.\n\nHowie Liu (01:12:40):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:42):\nAmazing. Okay, let me take a step back and zoom out and think about the broader journey you've been on over the past decade plus. Let me just ask you this, what's the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about Airtable building and company building teams that maybe goes against common startup wisdom?\n\nHowie Liu (01:13:02):\nI heard your interview with Brian Chesky and then later you talked about founder mode in that YC retreat, and the points there really, really resonated with me. I feel like maybe less eloquently I deduced some of the same principles just in my own experience, which is I think when you're scaling up, and this relates also to what we talked about before around the early days of building a company, you're in the details, you're finding product market fit, you kind of have to be pretty versatile, right? All these decisions from a technical standpoint to design, to even commercial, and what's the freemium model going to be like? And how are we going to market this product? What does the website look like? They're all very intertwined, right? You can't compartmentalize and then almost factory produce each of these things separately. They're all intertwined and you have a very small tight-knit team that's thinking full stack about all of this combined.\n\n(01:14:04):\nObviously that's the only way, in my opinion, to create that magical product market fit in the first place. Then I think as you scale up, the default guidance that you often get from operational experts and larger scale company investors is like, okay, you got to industrialize the process of all of this stuff, right? It's kind of like going from a bespoke artisanal, one person made an entire item of clothing to we got to factory produce this thing, right?\n\n(01:14:38):\nWhat that means in an organizational context is you then create these different fiefdoms, you hire all these execs and each exec just manages their own swim lane, and there's relatively looser coupling between all of those different groups, right? So then you've got sales executing on its own thing, marketing's executing on its own thing, product's executing on its own thing. Even within product there's different product groups and surface areas that are each executing on their own thing.\n\n(01:15:05):\nUsing the factory metaphor of there's an argument that that's actually kind of an efficient way to scale up production for each of these different swim lanes, right? Each one can operate in a more autonomous and purely scale up focus, wait, how do we produce more of this thing? If the thing happens to be within one product group improving search, that's our main focus. We're just going to go and ship, ship, ship more stuff to improve search. So it's not completely crazy why people give this advice, but I think what you lose is the magical integrative value of holistic thinking and making the bigger picture bets, right?\n\n(01:15:48):\nI think Brian talked a lot about this on his episode with you, which is like, look, in a company that is really serious about product, first of all, I really liked his point about the CEO has to play a CPO role, you have to care about the product. Ultimately the product is the thing and you can't just coast on scaling up go-to-market around the product forever, you got to keep innovating on the product. By the way, the best way to innovate on the product is not incrementally split over all these different little surface areas, but actually to have a bigger, more step function vision of how this product needs to make a leap, or what's the next big either act of the product or new capability of the product or reinvention of the product, right?\n\n(01:16:35):\nSo I think if you really care about doing that from a product execution standpoint and almost refinding new product market fit on a regular basis, I think it necessitates a completely different operating and leadership model throughout the organization. All of the stuff we just talked about in terms of how to operate in the AI native era I think is actually exactly the same as how you need to operate in this constant product market refinding of fit state.\n\n(01:17:02):\nSo I could not agree more with that concept of you got to think ambit",

All of the stuff we just talked about in terms of how to operate in the AI native era I think is actually exactly the same as how you need to operate in this constant product market refinding of fit state.\n\n(01:17:02):\nSo I could not agree more with that concept of you got to think ambitiously and move the organization holistically towards these bigger outcomes, but also ship and learn and experiment a lot more in this era. Then maybe the meta learning I had from all of the above is that the specific advice obviously was like, okay, go scale up in this way or go hire these types of people, experienced operators, et cetera. Now, obviously there's some truth to that, right? The people giving this advice are not incompetent. They had some reason for giving it and in certain contexts that is the right thing to do, but I think my meta learning is it's not enough to just trust the recommendation, like, here's the action you should take from a lot of people, 'cause everybody has different priors and it's almost like we're all our own LLMs, and we all have different training from a different corpus of data informed by our own experiences. Maybe you're trained on the service-\n\nHowie Liu (01:18:00):\n... experiences, and maybe you're trained on like the kind of ServiceNow or the Oracle training corpus, and this person's trained on the Facebook corpus, and I'm trained on the Airtable one. I think what I've tried to do more and more is not to just ignore advice from smart people. Obviously, that's not the right answer, but to kind of take their... It's almost like in an LLM you can now with a reasoning model actually inspect the chain of thought and see how it's thinking. Why did it come up with this answer? To me, that chain of thought like \"Why did you recommend this?\", is actually more informative than the actual, \"Just do this recommendation.\"\n\n(01:18:44):\nThe answer might be like, \"Hey, at So-and-So company, this is how we eliminated the PM role entirely.\" For Brian at Airbnb, it made sense. We're no longer having PMs in their traditional form. Now, we have program managers and product marketers, but more than the actual decision because I don't think it's a one-size-fits-all, everybody should do the same, why did you do that? The why actually was very informative, and then be able to take that and say like, \"Okay, how would I apply that?\" Maybe it yields a different outcome, but the reasoning actually is very informative.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:19):\nIt's interesting how this idea founder mode is not so different from this ICCO trend that you're following and it's-\n\nHowie Liu (01:19:26):\nFor sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:26):\n... yeah, yeah, it's like being in the weeds, being in the details, trying things yourself, not delegating to execs.\n\nHowie Liu (01:19:32):\nYeah, and I think anything taken to an extreme can be problematic. There is a world where you are so in the details and in every detail that you're basically just micromanaging and you're kind of creating like a euphemism for that. That's not really what founder mode is about. That's not like the Brian conception of founder mode is to like micromanage everything and not trust anyone, but I think it's more about finding that right balance of being unabashed about caring about the details that do matter and where the tying together of details across different groups or departments actually is the only way to yield a non-incremental outcome. Otherwise, each person is just optimizing within their own domain, but you'll never get to the global maxima or the global breakthrough. \n\n(01:20:23):\nI think the really cool thing about CEOs as I seize it, frankly any leader playing more of an IC-like role and being in the details is I think for the right type of person, it's actually more fun that way. I mean, to be honest, for me, the times where I felt most disintermediated from what I felt was the substance of this company was when I thought that I was almost like forcing myself to step away from the details. I thought that's what a at-scale CEO was supposed to do. I mean, there's some famous CEOs who have talked about, \"The less decision I could make the better. The less details I'm exposed to the better. I just want to inspect at the topmost layer how this business is running, and if everything underneath it is going smoothly, then I'm able to do that and everything looks good.\"\n\n(01:21:19):\nI just think that's maybe, again, it works in a certain type of very mature type of business. Even then, though, I can't imagine that at a CPG company like a Procter & Gamble. You wouldn't want to have a CEO who still actually goes and tastes the soup and tries the products and sees literally the details of what the new product innovation pipeline looks like, as well as like how it's being experienced on the shelves and so on. I don't know. I guess I'm just more and more skeptical that that hands-off pure delegation and process management role ever works as a CEO. Maybe you go through a long enough period of where the business is coasting that nobody notices, but I got to say, for me it's just much more invigorating to get to play that role. I think for the types of operators and leaders that I most admire, that's what makes the job interesting. They don't want to have a automated away kind of role as a leader.\n\nL",

I mean, first of all, if your passion is building product and product design, even if it feels like at times the company needs to do all this other stuff like scale up, go to market, and operations and just have like a large people organization, that itself creates a lot of need to do things and manage. There becomes a new job invented just to manage a larger group of people, and obviously you're going to have to do some of that. You can't just completely eschew all your responsibility as an at-scale CEO, but don't lose the essence of the thing that you love doing and that really made this product happen and gives this company as many companies that were founded on a magical product market fit finding insight. Don't step too far away from that, and always make sure that is still your number one, even if other stuff has to also add to your plate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:45):\nI think people don't talk enough about this how if someone starts a company that's an idea they have they're excited about, it takes off and then you're stuck on that for a long time, and then even if things are pushed in a direction you're not as excited about. This point about just remembering what you actually love about it and coming back to that is so important because that's the only way to keep doing this for a long time.\n\nHowie Liu (01:24:05):\nI think that's so true, and to me that's why there's always been a difference between entrepreneurs who love the act of building a product or the business, too, versus those who saw a just purely business or financial opportunity that they felt like they couldn't pass up exploiting or going after. Look, no knock on people who are more the latter, and there's entire industries where it's all just about alpha generation. You can go into the private equity business and so on, and it's just purely it's rationally about how do I find the alpha? I think that some of the best companies, product central companies, at least in my opinion, are run by those people who actually just love the product. I think you get a feel for that from some of the AI companies like Sam, I think genuinely just loves working on AI.\n\n(01:25:03):\nIf he could spend a hundred percent of his time on just being close to the AI and the research, I mean, he would and he's even said as much. Ranging to like Brian's with Airbnb, it's pretty clear that people like this are not motivated like... Airbnb was not founded because like, \"Oh my God, we want to make a lot of money off this arbitrage opportunity against hotels.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:24):\nThey just needed to pay their rent.\n\nHowie Liu (01:25:26):\nYeah. Well, that and I think they loved the product and I think they also loved the way in which they built the product, the design-centric nature of that product and company and culture. That's what gives you the continued joy of working on what could be the same company for a very long time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:45):\nHowie, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nHowie Liu (01:25:51):\nI just want to reiterate, especially for listeners here who are in an EP or D role and especially in the P role, I really do believe that this is not like you either have or you don't like in terms of the skill set needed to be relevant and AI needed, but I do think it's a call to action to go and bolster your skill sets where they may be less refined right now. I think even programming, I really believe everyone could learn how to be a software engineer if they wanted to. Now, obviously, some people just as with like great writers are never going to be a published author or the Hemingway, but everyone can gain a good enough proficiency of software engineering if they really wanted to. \n\n(01:26:39):\nYou could take that boot camp. You could do like some coding exercises on the side, et cetera. The point there is that sometimes I think we treat these disciplines like hard, hard skills that if you're already halfway into your career and you're not already an engineer, if you're not already a designer, okay, well, you can never be one. I just think our brains are malleable and there's a lot of great curriculum out there to learn. Lot of it, like I said, just comes down to also like trial and error and building projects, maybe nights and weekends projects even to learn this stuff. Everyone can learn how to be a versatile kind of unicorn product engineer/designer hybrid in the AI-native era. The only thing stopping you is just going out and doing it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:30):\nThat is a really empowering way to end it, and just to double down on that, it's never been easier to",

Everyone can learn how to be a versatile kind of unicorn product engineer/designer hybrid in the AI-native era. The only thing stopping you is just going out and doing it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:30):\nThat is a really empowering way to end it, and just to double down on that, it's never been easier to learn these things. There are super intelligences that you can talk to that do a lot as they're building can help you learn.\n\nHowie Liu (01:27:43):\nYeah. I mean, literally, I go into ChatGPT sometimes and I ask it just like, \"Hey, how would you build this app?\" I'm just curious. I'm like, \"How would you build Manus, the open-ended agent?\" Literally, how would you build it? You can ask the questions and it's like having an amazing, brilliant software architect, software engineer, product manager, designer expert tutor that you can literally like there's no dumb question. They have infinite patience. They're literally on and awake 24/7. It is the most incredible time to learn this stuff, to your point. Then, of course, the interactive tools to go and actually build stuff. Anyone can download Cursor and just start asking Composer to generate some code for you, and then looking at the code and trying to figure out what it does. To your point, when I think back to the earliest era that I experienced of building apps, first I learned C++, then I learned PHP and JavaScript and even building kind of JavaScript single-page apps in the early days like '08 through 2010. It was a dark, dark art. I mean, there were some like... You just had to go and like learn some of these things. There wasn't great tutorials for it. You had to reverse engineer certain things. There were just weird things like if you wanted rounded corners in your UI, you literally took Photoshop, opened it up, created like a rounded corner in pixels, and then cut that pixel up into an image that you dropped onto the page at exactly the right position to be at the edge of a box.\n\n(01:29:15):\nIt's like crazy stuff. I mean, everything was so much more arcane at the time, and now it feels so much more fluid and accessible, and the gap between the arcane tech that you have to wade through to build something has just been minimized so much. It's like the effort and abstraction between you and the magical, delightful actual building of the thing that you want has been so minimized. It's never been a more exciting time to be a builder.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:47):\nYou remember spacer.gif?\n\nHowie Liu (01:29:49):\nOh yeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:50):\nIt's like to create. It's that line stuff you just kind of have-\n\nHowie Liu (01:29:52):\nYeah, I remember it. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:54):\n... the invisible one-pixel thing that you just stick in places.\n\nHowie Liu (01:29:57):\nYeah. Yeah, yeah. No.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:57):\nOh my God, what a time to be alive. Howie, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nHowie Liu (01:30:05):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:05):\nHere we go. What are two or three books you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nHowie Liu (01:30:09):\nYou know, I've been trying to read fiction more, partly because I think it's just a really nice mental reset. I will say like Three-Body Problem for anyone who hasn't read it, it's a mind-expanding book. I like sci-fi and fiction that kind of opens your brain, so maybe this is my cheat card, but it's a three-book series. Those are three great books.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:30):\nI love that series, and my tip there is it gets good one and a half books in is my tip, so just keep reading. That's where it's like, \"Okay, now I'm in.\"\n\nHowie Liu (01:30:40):\nI liked even the first one, but I felt like it was inception where every subsequent book was like you dropped into another, like you incepted into another layer, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:53):\nAwesome. Okay. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nHowie Liu (01:30:57):\nTV show, I just started watching The Studio. It's like the Seth Rogen, Rogen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:05):\nYeah, it's so stressful.\n\nHowie Liu (01:31:05):\nYep. Yeah, it is pretty stressful, and I mean, Silicon Valley was too close to home when it came out, so I watched it, but it was just cringy. The Studio is kind of fund to watch because it's a little bit about like inside baseball of Hollywood, and yet I'm not in Hollywood, so it's entertaining to watch. It's I thought smart and a funny show because I split time between L.A. and S.F. I also feel like it's very real to me. I see a lot of the literal characters out there in the world that it's characterizing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:43):\nDo you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love",

Could be an app, could be gadget, could be clothing.\n\nHowie Liu (01:31:48):\nOkay, so I'll give two because I feel like I have to say some kind of software product. I mean, I'm a really big fan of Runway, the product and the company. I just think every new model they come out with, they just came out with a new one just I think like two days ago that gives even more controls and refinement on creating exactly the video scene that you want. I think just the photorealism in what you can generate now, and they also built this cool demo thing that's an immersive world generator I mentioned before. I think it's just cool to see. I also like the underdog story. I'm clearly like Google's gunning in the space, has VO3 and so on and has its OpenAI, but I love the underdog story of this sub-hundred-person company still punching above their weight and building really awesome video experiences. That's the software one.\n\n(01:32:45):\nThen, a very, very kind of nerdy real-world answer on product is I kind of just recently got into this whole cottage industry of artisanally produced basically clothing by small-scale Japanese manufacturers that use literally like hundred-year-old looms to make clothes the old-fashioned way or the old-fashioned industrial way. They have these loop wheeler machines and they spin the cloth in a very slow pace, so it's completely impractical from a production-scale standpoint, but I've gotten some of these t-shirts and I just love the... I guess in a world where it feels like everything is becoming so much faster moving and even tech from five years ago is obsolete, I love a little bit of the throwback to like old things sometimes can be even more cherishable in this new era. Maybe that makes me a hipster, but I love the vintage, the retro increasingly these days.  \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:56):\nI feel like anything that starts with artisanal small batch Japanese is going to be really good stuff. Is there a brand you want to share that is that? Or is this like you want to keep it-\n\nHowie Liu (01:33:56):\nYeah. No, I mean-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:06):\n... under the radar.\n\nHowie Liu (01:34:07):\n... actually, so Self Edge, which actually has a storefront, the main storefront is on Valencia Street in S.F. They carry a lot of these items. That's kind of their whole MO and they have like jeans and t-shirts. I've gotten a lot. I mean, they basically curate a really good selection of different actual makers. One of them is called Studio D'Artisan, another one's called... Actually, it's cool. There's this company called... I think the umbrella company is actually just Toyo, T-O-Y-O, Manufacturing, which sounds like it's a big kind of like large-scale conglomerate, but it's anything but. It's like a really small-scale Japanese vintage manufacturer of clothing, but they have a few sub-brands.\n\n(01:34:51):\nThey actually bought the rights to this American post-war brand that was kind of like Hanes, one of the like big four or five menswear, kind of undershirts and athletic wear brands called Whitesville. I don't know where the name came from, but basically it's a bunch of like basic clothing, like t-shirts, et cetera, and this Japanese indie company, they bought the defunct basically name and now is reproducing clothes almost made to the exact shape and stack, and even with the exact recreation of the graphic packaging on these tees, but like today. I just think there's something really funny and ironic about they've taken an American post-war aesthetic and literal brand, but it's actually a indie small-scale Japanese manufacturing approach to making those clothes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:51):\nI feel like we just tapped into what could be a whole other podcast conversation about clothing and-\n\nHowie Liu (01:35:56):\nYeah-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:56):\n... craftsmanship-\n\nHowie Liu (01:35:57):\n... [inaudible 01:35:57].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:58):\n... but I'm going to pull us out of that.\n\nHowie Liu (01:35:59):\nThe next podcast franchise.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:02):\nOr just Howie and Lenny talking about clothing.\n\nHowie Liu (01:36:04):\nThat's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:05):\nOkay, two more questions.\n\nHowie Liu (01:36:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:06):\nDo you have a life motto that you often find useful in working or you like to share with friends or family?\n\nHowie Liu (01:36:12):\nI stumbled on this guy Paul Conti, who I think he's an MD, but also a psychologist, and he has a book, but also he did this long-form podcast with Andrew Huberman, and he actually ends up talking a lot about just how to think about your life outlook and kind of your framework for thinking about life,",

I found one particular point really, really powerful it took with me, which is if you live your life in a way that's foundationally built around humility and gratitude. Look, everybody has different circumstances.\n\n(01:37:06):\nI think I fully own that even though I didn't come from money, my family was very, very financially modest growing up. I still had incredible resources and opportunities afforded to me even just by virtue of growing up in the U.S., being born in and growing up in the U.S., but also having access to a computer and the internet and even all the free resources I could then access and learn about from there. I still feel like whatever you have or don't have to start with, if you kind of approach the world and kind of the future with a spirit of humility and gratitude rather than, I guess, the opposite of that, I think I've felt like it kind of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. You're open-minded, you're kind of grateful, and then more opportunities actually come your way, and maybe it's because the energy you're putting out into the world and other people.\n\n(01:38:07):\nYou're kind of attracting good opportunities and good people and good things, but I think there's a lot of other parts of his framework, but the one that is easiest to remember is like, how do I approach each day? Even if I'm going through a tough moment and I had to fire somebody today, or maybe I get disappointed because we lost a customer deal or something broke or whatever, but to still try to look at the entire situation from overall a feeling of humility and gratitude I think just really does shift your like... It spills over into everything else for that day and maybe even for the whole lifetime. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:52):\nThat super resonates. That is really powerful advice that's hard to internalize, but important.\n\nHowie Liu (01:38:57):\nYeah, it's easily said, hard to practice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:59):\nYeah. Where can folks find you? What should they know about Airtable and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nHowie Liu (01:39:05):\nOkay, so I am on Twitter, howietl. I don't post that much, but I'm a lurker, so I listen and watch, and you can always DM me there. You can also email me directly, howie@airtable.com, anytime you have ideas, feedback, et cetera. On Airtable, just go try it. The whole point is we want to make this an experiential product. That's why we're really leaning into the PLG roots. We talked about the homepage literally says like, \"Just start building right now. What do you want to build? Go.\" \n\n(01:39:36):\nIt starts building, and so use the product, give me feedback, and if you have ideas of your own and you want to rip on them, I love because my passion is thinking about product and product UX, especially in the AI era if you're working on or thinking about something interesting in that space. Even if it's just purely to riff on a concept, that's something I enjoy doing, and maybe I get to learn and sharpen my own skill set from. Feel free to reach out and, yeah, I mean, tell your friends and family to try Airtable as well. That's the main thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:08):\nSounds like you're looking for people to nerd snipe you and-\n\nHowie Liu (01:40:10):\nYes. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:12):\n... Howie, thank you so much for being here.\n\nHowie Liu (01:40:14):\nAwesome. Thank you, Lenny. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:15):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

The thing is, once you have one good idea, it often takes years to express that.\n\n(00:00:09):\nSo you had the idea to have a newsletter. I know some of the history of your newsletter. You've been working on the expression of that idea for years now. Jeff and Amazon had ideas like, \"Let's have Prime shipping.\" Prime is still getting better and still being worked on. It's a 20 some year old idea. The Kindle, a decades old idea now still getting better. The point here is you don't need very many good ideas to be seen as tremendously inventive.\n\nLenny (00:00:38):\nToday my guest is Ethan Evans. Ethan is a former vice president at Amazon, executive coach, and course creator focused on helping leaders grow into executives. Ethan spent 15 years at Amazon, helped invent and run Prime Video, the Amazon Appstore, Prime Gaming, and Twitch Commerce, which alone is a billion-dollar business for Amazon. He led global teams of over 800, helped draft one of Amazon's 14 core leadership principles, holds over 70 patents, and currently spends his time executive coaching and running courses to help people advance in their career, build leadership skills, and succeed in senior roles.\n\n(00:01:14):\nIn our conversation, Ethan shares an amazing story of when he failed on an important project for Jeff Bezos and what he learned from that experience. We spent some time on something called The Magic Loop, which is a very simple idea that I guarantee will help you get promoted and advance in your career. We also get into a bunch of other career advice, primarily for senior ICs, any managers. We get into advice for standing out in interviews, plus some of Amazon's most important and impactful leadership principles and much more. I learned a lot from Ethan and I'm excited to bring you this episode. With that, I bring you Ethan Evans after a short word from our sponsors. \n\n(00:01:50):\nLet me tell you about our product called Sidebar. The best way to level up your career is to surround yourself with extraordinary peers. This gives you more than a leg up. It gives you a leap forward. This worked really well for me in my career and this is the Sidebar ethos. When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This was a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group of peers. \n\n(00:02:20):\nSidebar is a private, highly vetted leadership program, where senior leaders are matched with peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your career journey. \n\n(00:02:39):\nIf you're a listener of this podcast, you're already committed to growth.

I'm super excited to talk about some of the things we have teed up today and to help people.\n\nLenny (00:04:37):\nThe first thing I thought we could chat about is The Magic Loop. So you wrote this guest post from my newsletter sometime earlier this year. It is, I don't know if you know this, but it's currently the sixth most popular post of all time on my newsletter across 300 plus posts. Did you expect this advice to resonate the way that it did, and why do you think it resonated as much as it did?\n\nEthan Evans (00:04:59):\nSo the competitive part of me really wants to analyze spots one to five and figure out, do they have an unfair advantage that they had more time? But I was very hopeful that the advice would resonate that way, because I put a lot of work into simplifying it and making it really easy to understand and follow.",

    "content": "Did you expect this advice to resonate the way that it did, and why do you think it resonated as much as it did?\n\nEthan Evans (00:04:59):\nSo the competitive part of me really wants to analyze spots one to five and figure out, do they have an unfair advantage that they had more time? But I was very hopeful that the advice would resonate that way, because I put a lot of work into simplifying it and making it really easy to understand and follow. So I'm very pleased it has, but I was hopeful it would do so well.\n\nLenny (00:05:24):\nWell, I will say sometimes they keep growing, so this isn't necessarily the terminal point for the post.\n\nEthan Evans (00:05:28):\nThe final position. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:05:30):\nOkay. So for people that haven't read this post, or maybe for folks that have and maybe could use a refresher, let's spend a little time here. Could you just briefly describe this idea of The Magic Loop that you wrote about?\n\nEthan Evans (00:05:40):\nYeah, absolutely. So The Magic Loop is how to grow your career in almost any circumstance, even with a somewhat difficult manager. It does assume that you're working in some environment, normally as an entrepreneur or with a boss. But the basic idea of The Magic Loop is five steps and they're very easy.\n\n(00:06:01):\nThe first one is you have to be doing your current job well. It's not possible to really grow your career if you're not considered at least performing at a solid level. Now, it doesn't mean you have to be the star on the team at this point, but what you can't have is your boss wishing that you were different. Like, \"Ethan's not very good.\" So you have to talk to your manager and find out how you're doing and address any problems. So step one is do your job well.\n\n(00:06:31):\nThen step two is ask your boss how you can help. Speaking as a manager, and I've talked to hundreds of managers, very few people go and ask their manager, \"What can I do to help you? What do you need?\" And so just asking sets you apart, and it begins to build a relationship that we're on the same team, that I'm here as a part of your organization to make you successful, not just myself. \n\n(00:06:53):\nStep three is whatever they say, do it. So you dig a big hole. If you say, \"What could I do to help you?\" And they say, \"Well, we really need someone to take out the tray sheets day,\" and you're like, \"Oh, I didn't mean that. I wanted exciting work. I don't want to do sort of this maintenance work or whatever.\" So do what they ask, help out even if it's not your favorite work. \n\n(00:07:14):\nOnce you've done that though, and maybe you do that a couple times, the fourth step is where the magic comes in. You go back to your manager and say, \"Hey, I'm really enjoying working with you. I'm wondering is there some way I could help you that would also help me reach my goal?\" And whether that goal is to change roles or get a raise or get a promotion, you say, \"My goal is I'd really like to learn this new skill. Is there something you need that would also help me learn this new skill?\" And the reason this works is managers help those who help them. It's just human nature. We all do that.\n\n(00:07:52):\nGenerally, they're very open to meeting you halfway and saying, \"Sure, I need this. We can rearrange it. We can find a way to meet your goals over time.\" Now for step four to work, you do have to know what is your goal, so you have to be clear on what it is you want. Well, that part's up to you. \n\n(00:08:15):\nAnd then step five is the easiest step of all. It's just repeat. So like lather, rinse, repeat with your shampoo. Step five is once you're working with your manager towards your goal and discussing where you're going, and you're helping each other, the magic of the loop is just go around and around.\n\nLenny (00:08:31):\nI was going to ask you, why is it that you call it The Magic Loop? Also, we kind of dived right in, but what is the goal of this? I guess it's pretty clear maybe at this point of this helps you advance in your career, but whatever you want to share along those lines.\n\nEthan Evans (00:08:43):\nYeah, okay. Very fair. So I called it The Magic Loop because I pioneered it with my audience a few years ago. And it works so well, that people were writing back in and saying, \"How do I turn this off? I'm in over my head now. My boss has asked me to do all these cool things, and I feel like I can't catch up, and I've already been promoted once and I need time to digest it.\" And it just seemed like it worked like magic. It worked in almost every circumstance. \n\n(00:09:15):\nThere are of course exceptions where you have very exploitative managers who are like, \"Oh, it's great. You're working harder, keep doing that, and they won't do anything for you.\" But those are rare. And then the purpose, yeah, to help you get satisfaction in your career. A lot of people are unhappy with their jobs. Many people want to move up a level or get paid more. Not everyone. Some people want to change what they're doing, they're bored. This is a path to all of that",

Some people want to change what they're doing, they're bored. This is a path to all of that, because it's forming a partnership with your leadership to say, \"Look, I'll help you, but I need you also to help me.\" And most good managers are very open to that.\n\nLenny (00:09:52):\nWhen we were working on this, one of the pieces of feedback I had was I feel like I could just tell my manager, \"Hey, I want to grow my career. What can we work on to help me get there?\" And your feedback was like, most managers are not that good and not that thoughtful about their employee's careers. Can you just talk a little bit about that? People may be hearing this and be like, \"Why do I need to do this? This seems like a lot of work.\"\n\nEthan Evans (00:10:15):\nIf you have a great manager, you may not need to do nearly as much formality. They may have given you good feedback, so you don't need to ask for feedback. They may have offered you opportunities to step up, and you've said yes to some and maybe no to others. That's fantastic. I designed The Magic Loop for the people who either don't know what to do or their manager is either not that good or just very busy.\n\n(00:10:37):\nRemember, lots of managers have great intentions to help their employees, but they get busy with their own lives, their own work, all the things they're focused on, even also their own career. The manager is often busy thinking about their own needs, and so they mean to get to you next week, and next week drifts on for a year.\n\nLenny (00:11:00):\nWhat has come up since this has come out that you would want to either add to, or tweak, or help people better understand? I imagine there's some criticism. I imagine there's a lot of, \"Yes, yes, yes. This really works.\"\n\nEthan Evans (00:11:12):\nTwo things I'd love to clarify. The first is many people ask me, \"Why do I have to do this? Shouldn't my manager notice what I'm doing? Shouldn't my manager help with my career? Shouldn't my manager be planning for me?\" And what I say about that is what your manager should do and $4 will get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks. \n\n(00:11:36):\nThe point of this loop is it's in your control. It is true that a good manager would do all those things I just mentioned, but not all managers are good and some of them need some help. And the thing I would just say about The Magic Loop is it's in your control.\n\n(00:11:52):\nAnd so you can be upset that your manager isn't perfect, but move on from that and take control of your own situation. That's the first thing I'd say. The other big extension I would make is look, if you are a manager or a leader of any type, you can initiate The Magic Loop from your side, so you can talk to your employees and say, \"Hey, what are your career goals? Would you like to form a partnership where you step up to new challenges and I help you get to your goals?\"\n\n(00:12:26):\nI had a lot of success forming this kind of partnership with my employees, where as they saw growth and success, they really leaned in and like, \"This system works. You're actually investing in me now. I'll work extra hard.\" And I'm like, \"Yes, and we can grow your team or grow your opportunity,\" and it was very win-win.\n\nLenny (00:12:46):\nTo give people a little bit of social proof, you mentioned some of the folks you've worked with on this. Can you share some stories, or stats, or anything to help people understand how helpful this ended up being to folks you've worked with?\n\nEthan Evans (00:12:58):\nYeah, absolutely. I'll tell one story from each end of the spectrum. And what I mean there is entry-level people and then high level executive leaders. I had an entry-level person write me back and say, \"Look, when I learned about The Magic Loop, I was at a company and not doing very well. I started applying it. They offered me a $30,000 raise and a bigger job. And I turned it down because I got hired at this other company that was offering me even more, and I went there. And they've promoted me also,\" and he was one of the people who wrote in and said, his exact words were, \"A year ago I was made redundant.\" So he is in the UK, redundant is their word for laid off. \"A year ago I was made redundant. I got this first job and I got an offer for an increased salary, and then I got the second job and I got an increase when I joined that was even bigger.\" And he was in that situation of, \"Mow I need to sort of slow down and digest all of that.\"\n\n(00:14:05):\nOn the complete other end, one of my best people I ever worked with joined my team at Amazon as what we would call an SDE II, which in Amazon is a level five employee. He grew with me kind of following this process to a senior engineer. Then he switched to management and ran a small team. Then he became",

He grew with me kind of following this process to a senior engineer. Then he switched to management and ran a small team. Then he became a senior manager and he relocated with my organization. He opened a new office in another city, was eventually promoted to director running his own office of a couple hundred people. And this was over the course of about eight years. He went from a mid-level engineer to an executive with a team of 800 people. Now he was a very hard worker, but over this eight years we just saw all this progress.\n\n(00:14:56):\nAnd then eventually he moved on. He founded his own startup, sold that, and now works as an executive vice president at one of the major online banks. And so his career in some sense has exceeded mine, but during that eight year span, he just grew so much. And this is the process we followed.\n\nLenny (00:15:19):\nWow, those are excellent examples. What levels does this help you with? At what level is this most useful, and then does it kind of taper out it? I don't know if you get to VP level, do you still try using Magic Loop?\n\nEthan Evans (00:15:33):\nSo I think it works anywhere from the start of your career to pretty far into it. I think at my level, I finished my career as a vice president at Amazon. It does peter out in the sense of the active. And what I mean by that is you're still doing the same thing, but you don't have to talk about it. Your managers are expecting you to step up and recognize challenges. They're expecting you to ask for resources when you need them, and you don't sort of have this level of explicit conversation around, what can I help you with? They're expecting you to anticipate what's needed.\n\n(00:16:09):\nSo in the newsletter we did together, I wrote about how over time, you go from asking your manager, \"How can I help?\" To suggesting to your manager, \"These are some things I see that seem like they need to be done. Would you like me to do them?\" To just seeing what needs to be done and sort of keeping your leader in the loop and saying, \"Hey, I noticed that we have this problem. I fixed it. I noticed we have this opportunity. I've started program against it.\" I think at the executive level, it's much more you being proactive and just keeping your leader in the loop.\n\nLenny (00:16:44):\nI think in the post, the way you described this step is this is advanced mode. Don't jump straight to this. Don't just start suggesting things, because you may get it wrong.\n\nEthan Evans (00:16:53):\nYeah, well, it's all a matter of rapport and trust. A huge part of career success is how much trust you have, mutual respect with your leadership. When they're confident that you're going to make the right decisions, they're confident to let you go. But yeah, when you're brand new or you're new to a manager, if you just jump in, you may either not work on the things they value or even find yourself working across purposes, and that isn't the right place to start.\n\nLenny (00:17:19):\nAwesome. Okay. Just to close out this conversation. You touched on this, but why is it that you think this is so important and effective? Why do you think this works so well? People may not recognize, \"I see this is the key to this.\"\n\nEthan Evans (00:17:31):\nWell, I think it's two things. First, I mentioned how rare it is for managers to be offered help. If you're a manager, you'll recognize this. If not, feel free to talk to any manager, whether your own or somebody else. Ask them how much they worry and how much they feel overwhelmed and wish someone would give them a hand. Management can be a lonely job, because you feel like you're responsible for everything. So having an ally, it's just a huge weight off people's shoulders.\n\n(00:18:01):\nAnd then I think a lot about social engineering. The social engineering's here is just the simple, \"You help me, I'll help you.\" It doesn't have to be exploitative, it's just we help those people who help us, and that's built into human survival. \n\n(00:18:18):\nAnd I think this loop works so well because it's just leaning a little bit into that behavior. So many relationships with managers are oppositional. You tell me what to do, and I'm kind of like a kid in high school who's trying to figure out how do I skip as many classes as possible and turn in as little homework and still get by with a D? That relationship won't build your career.\n\n(00:18:45):\nSome people approach their jobs as my goal is to do the least I can and still collect my paycheck. That's an approach if you're okay with where you are. It's not what I coach though. I assume people want to grow.\n\nLenny (00:19:02):\nOkay, so maybe it's just as a closing question, for people that are listening and want to start putting this into practice slash are stuck in their career and are just like, \"Okay, I see. Here's something I can do.\" Could you just again summarize the loop briefly?\n\nEthan Evans (00:19:15):\nSure. Step one, make sure you're doing your current job well. The",

Here's something I can do.\" Could you just again summarize the loop briefly?\n\nEthan Evans (00:19:15):\nSure. Step one, make sure you're doing your current job well. The way I explain this is when you go to your manager and ask, \"What could I do to help?\" You don't want their answer, even if they don't say it quite so bluntly to be, \"Do your F-ing job.\" You need to be doing that already. So be doing a good job.\n\n(00:19:34):\nAnd unfortunately, a good job is in the eyes of your manager in this case. You may think I'm doing great work, but if your manager doesn't, they're the ones you need to build as an ally here. \n\n(00:19:46):\nOnce you have that, go ask how you can help, do whatever you're asked, and then go back to your manager and suggest or ask, \"I would like to meet this goal. Can I keep helping you? What could I take on that you need that would also help me meet this goal?\" And that's where you start to try to bring your two sets of aims together. What do you need done, how can I get to my goal? And let's do those things together.\n\n(00:20:11):\nAnd then you just repeat this loop. You build trust, you build the relationship. And with all good managers, and even a lot of moderate managers, they appreciate the help so much, they really lean into that.\n\nLenny (00:20:23):\nI think there's two really important elements of this that you haven't even mentioned necessarily, that I think are part of the reason this works so well. One is this forces you and your manager to identify the gaps that are keeping you from the next level, which it's often vague, and then you get to a performance review, and then your manager's like, \"Ethan, you're still not good on this and this and that,\" and you're like, \"You never told me that that's the things you're looking for for me to get promoted.\" So I think there's this implicit, here's what you need to work on to get to the next level, which I think is part of step four. \n\n(00:20:53):\nAnd then you actually did touch on this that it's important to share your goal to your manager. Here's what I want. I want to get promoted. A lot of times they don't know that and you helping them understand, \"Here's what I want, help me get there.\" It goes a long way. So there's a lot-\n\nEthan Evans (00:21:06):\nManagers often fall into the trap. They chose to become managers, so they assume one of two things about you. They either assume that you want to keep doing exactly what you're doing forever, just maybe make a little more money.\n\n(00:21:16):\nSo you're an artist, you want to keep drawing forever. You're a lawyer, you want to keep writing contracts forever. Or they assume that, \"Hey, I became a manager. I'm very proud of my career. That must be what you want.\"\n\n(00:21:29):\nAnd these assumptions are natural, right? We tend to view by default that our path is great and everyone would want to be us. Now of course, some good managers don't do that. But if you clarify and express your goals, you remove that ambiguity.\n\nLenny (00:21:45):\nI actually had a period in my career where I specifically did not want to get promoted. I was very happy where I was, and I just wanted to keep doing this awesome IC role. Is that something at all you see where people are just like, \"I'm good. I don't need to get promoted,\" and then is this helpful in that in any way or is it not as big a deal?\n\nEthan Evans (00:22:02):\nSo first, I reached a point in my career where I was no longer pursuing promotion either, and I wanted to do other things. So I've lived that myself and I've used the same loop, but I used it to go do what I wanted to say, \"This is now what I want, and how do we get there? How do we create a role where I'm adding value appropriate to my level, but I'm doing this other work that's fun?\" I moved into gaming and I really wanted to do that.\n\n(00:22:25):\nSecond, I think it is still helpful because there's something you want probably. Maybe you want to work on different kinds of projects or maybe you want to work with a different higher performance team. Or maybe you want to rebalance your life and say, \"Hey, I love what I'm doing, but how can I be a star performer for you but within these boundaries?\"\n\n(00:22:47):\nSo if you truly have the perfect job just as it is, you may not need The Magic Loop. But I know so few people if you're like, \"Nope, there's absolutely nothing I could improve about my role.\"\n\nLenny (00:23:00):\nYeah, I think that your point about your goal doesn't have to be promotion. It could be work on a different part of the org, try something totally... Maybe transition to a new function that could be part of your goal. Awesome. \n\n(00:23:09):\nOkay, so along the same lines of career progression, you work with a lot of senior manager types, kind of the level of L7 and one M2-ish, and",

Maybe transition to a new function that could be part of your goal. Awesome. \n\n(00:23:09):\nOkay, so along the same lines of career progression, you work with a lot of senior manager types, kind of the level of L7 and one M2-ish, and you share with me that one of the most frustrating parts of their job in that specific portion of their career is they get stuck at that level and they don't move up, and it becomes really annoying, and they're not sure how to break out of that. What advice you share with folks like that, that may be listening?\n\nEthan Evans (00:23:36):\nYeah, so it's common to get stuck there, and there are a few reasons for it. First, there are a lot of senior managers. If you think of your average director, they may have six to eight reports. How many more directors are needed? So there's a choke point.\n\n(00:23:52):\nSecond, that choke point is worse in the current economy, and in the past maybe a lot of companies, Amazon, Google, apple, etc., were growing very rapidly. And so it wasn't just you were waiting for some other director to leave. The teams were getting bigger.\n\n(00:24:07):\nI experienced this at Amazon, where over a nine-year period I went from managing six people to 800. And so I went from a senior manager all the way to a vice president, and I described I was, in some sense just riding the elevator. The elevator was going up, and as long as I managed to stay on it, I was going to arrive at vice president.\n\n(00:24:29):\nBut the other thing that causes people to get stuck is the difference between a senior manager and a director is how you lead and the work you're doing. And you can get as far as senior manager by being really strong in your function and being really good at getting things done. As a director, and as a VP beyond that, it becomes much more about influence, coordination with others, and letting go of being in all the details yourself. And so senior managers really have to change some behavior.\n\n(00:25:03):\nI often reference the book by Marshall Goldsmith, What Got You Here Won't Get You There. Not only because it's a great book classically on this problem, but because the title tells the story. All the great traits that got you to this one level won't get you to the next level where you're more expected to be thinking in strategic terms, thinking longer term.\n\nLenny (00:25:26):\nSo to someone that may be in that role today and they're not moving up, is there anything they can do? This point about just there's no roles for you, there's only so much you can do there, is the advice just wait until an opportunity arrives? Is it run this Magic Loop until something happens? Is there anything you can do?\n\nEthan Evans (00:25:42):\nI would be honest with people and say some patience is required. At this level, there is some notion of, do we need a director? Do we need a vice president? Do we have a challenge at that level that needs that person? And so promotions at this level, I often teach have two components. The first component is can I eat and do that job? Am I qualified? Do I have the skills? But the second piece is, do we have such a job that needs that?\n\n(00:26:09):\nHowever, there is a lot you can do. A lot is in your control. And what is in your control is to start practicing those next level skills. Start working with your leadership on, where can I take on a strategic project? How can I become more of an inventor? I teach some about how to sort of systematically be inventive. It's not pure magic. Edison said it's 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. You can learn the 99%, and the 1% isn't as hard then. So you start showing those next level traits. And as I describe it most succinctly, how do you make yourself the person who will be chosen out of the eight?\n\n(00:26:51):\nAnd you can be chosen, there are several ways to move up. Your boss can leave or be let go. They can be promoted to another role. But another way is I coach now, and I have several clients recently. I was just talking to a client yesterday, her two peers were let go. They were all the same level. Her two peers were let go and she was given their teams. And she expressed that her boss had been told, \"You have too many senior managers for the size of your organization. We need to do some change in the organization, clean house, and put all your people under the folks who have potential.\"\n\n(00:27:32):\nWell, obviously she must be one of those people, because she still has her job and has more people and more to do. And unfortunately, her peers are shopping for new employment. So be that person, and that's where The Magic Loop comes in. Be that person.\n\nLenny (00:27:48):\nI was just talking actually to a senior PM leader who pointed out that with this kind of lean environment of a lot of flattening of orgs and a lot of layoffs, that this is becoming increasingly hard. Exactly what you're describing. There's just less spots, because companies are running more lean, and so you just kind of have to wait. \n\n(00:28:06):\nI think part of this advice you just shared, which",

Exactly what you're describing. There's just less spots, because companies are running more lean, and so you just kind of have to wait. \n\n(00:28:06):\nI think part of this advice you just shared, which is classic do the job before you have the job makes all the sense in the world. Because once people see that you can do it, obviously they'll feel a lot more comfortable putting you in that position.\n\nEthan Evans (00:28:18):\nAnd they'll be looking. I always remind people, as a leader, I want the best people under me I can have. It's not that I don't wish to promote you. If you think about my job, this helps people, right? I have selfish motivation to promote you. A lot of people think, \"The bosses there holding me down.\" Well, maybe some bosses are, but why wouldn't I want stronger, more capable direct reports? Why wouldn't I want people under me who can do more of my job? Frankly, that's the only way I can do less of my job.\n\nLenny (00:28:47):\nPlus this pressure you're always getting from your reports. So like, \"Hey, I'm ready to get promoted, because this time\"... You mentioned this word inventiveness, and I was just listening to Jeff Bezos on Lex Fridman, and I don't know if you heard this, but Jeff Bezos described himself most as an inventor more than anything else that he does. Is that something that you think about? Is that influenced by Jeff Bezos any way, that idea of being an inventor as a leader?\n\nEthan Evans (00:29:13):\nI'll say a couple things about that. First, I know you talked to my old boss, Bill Carr, who wrote Working Backwards. What I don't know is if he shared with you that after he published it, he actually realized there was a better title. He wishes that he had called the book The Invention Machine, because what Jeff was trying to do with Amazon was create the most inventive company, the company that would systematically out-invent others. And so while Working Backwards is a great title, Bill and Jeff think they should have called it the Invention Machine.\n\n(00:29:47):\nWhen I joined Amazon, I did not think of myself as an inventor, but I saw that we had these leadership principles think big and invent and simplify that pushed on that. And I said, \"I'm in trouble. I don't know how to do this.\" And I sat down and thought about that. What am I going to do? It seems like that's required. And I figured out how to become systematically inventive. So I now hold over 70 patents as one benchmark of inventiveness, and they were all created during my 15 years at Amazon. \n\n(00:30:22):\nAnd the way I did that, inventiveness actually isn't that hard. I teach about this. And to invent systematically, first you do need to be somewhat of an expert in whatever area you want to invent. So Lenny, if you and I say let's get together and we're going to invent cancer drugs, we have the problem that neither of us, as far as I know is a biologist, a doctor. We don't have the right background, we don't know what we're doing. So we would just be fumbling around I guess with a bathtub full of chemicals hoping. It's probably not going to work out that well. So you have to be something of a knowledgeable expert.\n\n(00:30:56):\nBut then the second thing people don't do is they don't spend dedicated time actually thinking. They feel like, \"Invention is just going to come to me.\" When I want to invent, I get away from all my devices. I go in a room with the problem I have, and I force myself to actually concentrate on what do I know and how can I invent? And the most straightforward way to invent is not to somehow come up with something completely new, but instead to put together two things that exist. \n\n(00:31:28):\nAnd so my example of this, I have a patent I talk about a lot for a drone delivery for Amazon, but the drone doesn't fly from the warehouse. Instead, a truck with no top drives slowly around the neighborhood, and the drones go back and forth from the truck. As opposed to the driver stopping at every house, you can have four or six drones hitting everything in the neighborhood. \n\n(00:31:55):\nAnd the way I came up with this idea is one day I was thinking about drones and delivery, but I loved military history. And so I was thinking also about an aircraft carrier and I was thinking, is there a way to have an aircraft carrier for drones? And from that, it was very quick for the light bulb to go on and say, well, what about a truck? \n\n(00:32:17):\nAnd so I have this patent, and we haven't seen this become reality yet. I'm waiting for my idea to become part of Amazon's drone delivery system, but I think ultimately it will.\n\nLenny (00:32:32):\nThat is badass. I'm imagining returns come back to the truck. We're using that rope thing that just captures them with that little hook.\n\nEthan Evans (00:32:42):\nYeah. Well, there's no reason... Same thing. When you want to return something as opposed to taking it to the UPS Store or whatever, you just put it on your porch, and then on your phone, on your app, maybe you take a picture of it so",

When you want to return something as opposed to taking it to the UPS Store or whatever, you just put it on your porch, and then on your phone, on your app, maybe you take a picture of it so that the drone can recognize the box or you put it in a designated spot, and you push a button and the drone takes your return away. Yes, there's no reason.\n\nLenny (00:33:03):\nCan't wait for that. And it takes your dog backs in it sometimes, part of it.\n\nEthan Evans (00:33:09):\nMy dog's too heavy, thank you.\n\nLenny (00:33:11):\nMy dog's not. There's an owl in our backyard that we sometimes worry he is going to come grab our dog on. This idea of invention, this is really interesting. I didn't plan to talk about this, but for someone like say a PM on a team that wants to get better at invention, innovation, big thinking, is there a practice you find helpful here? Is it block off two hours, get a pen and paper, and just think about the specific two adjacent things working together?\n\nEthan Evans (00:33:34):\nSo that's part of the process, is put in dedicated time. The interesting thing I would say is you don't need that much time. Two hours is great, but you only need two hours once a month. People think invention takes all this time. The thing is once you have one good idea, it often takes years to express that.\n\n(00:33:52):\nSo you had the idea to have a newsletter. I know some of the history of your newsletter. You've been working on the expression of that idea for years now. Jeff and Amazon had ideas like, \"Let's have Prime shipping.\" Well, Prime is still getting better and still being worked on. It's a 20 some year old idea. The Kindle a decade's old idea now still getting better. \n\n(00:34:16):\nSo the point here is you don't need very many good ideas to be seen as tremendously inventive. Like Elon Musk, Tesla, he can kind of dust off his hands and be like, \"I am now an Edison-like inventor.\" So he keeps doing it, but you don't need that many inventions.\n\nLenny (00:34:36):\nThis touches on something else Jeff Bezos shared on the podcast that most of his innovation and work is in the optimizing phase. It's not the here's the idea, it's the making it cheaper, and better, and faster. And that's where most of the good stuff comes from. In this point of Tesla, Elon had this idea, and now the hard work is actually making it scalable and cheap enough for people to use, not just an electric car.\n\nEthan Evans (00:34:59):\nWith the idea of Jeff saying that invention is really a lot of the incremental and optimization, I completely agree with that. To invent well, you need a base idea, but then there's so much of the work is making that idea real.\n\n(00:35:15):\nAnd again, Prime is a great example of this. The Amazon Prime program was a great example of, okay, we want fast free shipping. We want this program. That was a one-time idea that they did build, but now Prime has expanded. First it was two-day in the US, then one-day in the US, now it's same day in the US. But also they added Prime Video, Prime Music, Prime Gaming. There's actually something like 25 things you get free with Prime. Most people have no idea, because you get free photo storage and this ongoing list. And all of that is that incremental optimization to make it better, better, better, better. And of course Jeff's goal, which you probably heard him say, was to make Prime a no-brainer, to where you would be irresponsible really not to be a member.\n\nLenny (00:36:06):\nI know you have an awesome Jeff Bezos story that I want to get to, but before we do that, one more question along this line of career advice and progression. So I read somewhere that you've interviewed over 2,500 people over the course of your career. And so kind of going back to the beginning of a career, or at least getting a job, what have you found is most helpful in standing out as a candidate when you're interviewing, and essentially getting hired? What advice do you have for people that may be going through an interview process right now?\n\nEthan Evans (00:36:33):\nThere's a lot of evidence that suggests that the number one and two factors in any interview are appearance and enthusiasm. And it doesn't mean you have to be beautiful, but show up somewhere looking like you're interested in the job, not in your pajamas. And most importantly, be enthusiastic. People want to work with people that want to work with them. So if you seem very judgmental of the company and like you have to sell me on it, you're going to turn them off. I look at every interview of whether or not I really want this job, I might've decided I don't want the job. I still want the offer.\n\n(00:37:10):\nAnd so I come to any interview I do leaned in and talking about how excited I am to be a part of this opportunity and what I know about the company. Beyond those cosmetics, the biggest thing I see particularly at higher levels is people talk about what they have done but not why it mattered. They don't talk about the impact.\n\n(00:37:32):\nSee",

Beyond those cosmetics, the biggest thing I see particularly at higher levels is people talk about what they have done but not why it mattered. They don't talk about the impact.\n\n(00:37:32):\nSee, a leader is not hiring someone to just do work. They're hiring someone because they have a problem or a need. And so if you can show them, \"Look, here's the things I've done that have made a difference. Here's the things I've done that have helped my past employers where I've had an impact.\" So I didn't just do work. That makes you a worker. Someone who has an impact is more of a leader.\n\n(00:37:57):\nAnd leader doesn't need to mean people manager, just a higher level, that I have done something that solve the big problem, and here's how it changed the company or customer outlook. That's what I'm looking for in an interview, is are you bringing me an understanding of the business that shows you contributed to the business, or are you just telling me how hard you worked?\n\nLenny (00:38:19):\nAwesome. On that first piece, now that most interviews I imagine over Zoom, in terms of enthusiasm and looking professional, is there anything you've found that people may not be thinking about in those two buckets?\n\nEthan Evans (00:38:33):\nYeah. Show the person full-time dedication. So unless you really don't have any choice, don't take an interview from a car, don't have your camera off. Eye contact is still a real thing. Body language is still a real thing. Gestures like I'm making now with my hands, they're part of your presentation.\n\n(00:38:53):\nSo be fully present and try to project through the camera a little bit of I'm excited to be a part of this and I appreciate the opportunity. I often tell people the best way to prep for an interview might be a good night's sleep and a pot of coffee, that being fully engaged and energetic is a huge lever.\n\nLenny (00:39:18):\nAwesome. And I think basically, the feedback there is don't over obsess with the content. There's a lot of value in just how you come across.\n\nEthan Evans (00:39:27):\nYeah, 100%.\n\nLenny (00:39:29):\nLet me tell you about a product called Arcade. Arcade is an interactive demo platform that enables teams to create polished on-brand demos in minutes. Telling the story of your product is hard, and customers want you to show them your product, not just talk about it or gate it. That's why product four teams such as Atlassian, [inaudible 00:39:49], and Retool use Arcade to tell better stories within their homepages, product change logs, emails, and documentation.\n\n(00:39:56):\nBut don't just take my word for it. Quantum Metric, the leading digital analytics platform created an interactive product tour library to drive more prospects. With Arcade, they achieved a 2x higher conversion rate for demos and saw five times more engagement than videos. On top of that, they built the demo 10 times faster than before.\n\n(00:40:14):\nCreating a product demo has never been easier. With browser-based recording, Arcade is the no-code solution for building personalized demos at scale. Arcade offers product customization options, designer approved editing tools, and rich insights about how your viewers engage every step of the way. Ready to tell more engaging product stories that drive results? Head to arcade.software/lenny and get 50% off your first three months. That's arcade.software/lenny.\n\n(00:40:44):\nNow let's take a little trip to failure corner. This is something that I do more and more on this podcast, talk about people's failures in their career and their learnings. And apparently you have a great story of failing the great Jeff Bezos and surviving to tell the tale. Could you share that story?\n\nEthan Evans (00:41:00):\nI do. It's both a highlight and a low light. So I had been at Amazon about six years. I had become a director, and I was responsible for launching Amazon's app store.\n\n(00:41:14):\nAnd so we were building an Android-based app store to go on Google phones and eventually on the Kindle tablets. And we got to launch day. And at that time, Jeff used to write a letter introducing new products. He would write a letter that said, \"Dear customers, today Amazon's proud to launch blah blah, blah, and it's got these great features and I hope you really enjoy it. Thanks Jeff.\" And we would take down all the sales stuff on www.amazon.com and that letter would fill the whole screen. \n\n(00:41:48):\nAnd so he had written a Jeff letter, and this Jeff letter emphasized a particular feature of our product that he really liked. So that something that made it a little different.\n\n(00:42:00):\nAnd that specific thing was we had a button called test drive that you could click on and it would open the app in a simulator in your web browser, so you could check out the app and interact with it before putting it on your phone. So he thought this was really cool and he was all about it. \n\n(00:42:19):\nWell, my team had built all this technology. We had test drive working. It was kind of a hard piece of technology if you think about simulating any of thousands of arbitrary apps. And we worked all night to launch it, and it wasn't quite working",

It was kind of a hard piece of technology if you think about simulating any of thousands of arbitrary apps. And we worked all night to launch it, and it wasn't quite working at 6:00 AM. We were still debugging.\n\n(00:42:38):\nNow you know engineers very well. And I'm sure most of your listeners know about engineers, even if that's not their discipline. We always think we're this close to finding the last bug. \n\n(00:42:49):\nSo about 6:15 AM, I get a message from Jeff that says, \"Hey, I woke up, where's the letter?\" Because it was supposed to go live at 6:00 AM, right after the markets in New York would've opened at 9:00 AM Eastern. And he says, \"Where's the letter?\" And I write him back and I say, \"Well, we're working on a few problems.\" And what I'm thinking in my head is, \"Get in the shower, get in the shower. I just need 20 minutes, get in the shower.\"\n\nLenny (00:43:18):\nFor Jeff to get in the shower.\n\nEthan Evans (00:43:20):\nYeah. And 30 seconds later, I have an email back that says, \"What problems?\" And at this point I have to start explaining, and I end up explaining that we're having a problem with a database, and we're debugging this database problem. And he's like, \"Wait, there's a database in your design? We're trying to eliminate all Oracle databases and move to AWS. Why do you even have this?\" And he is just getting more and more frustrated and angry.\n\n(00:43:49):\nAnd he starts copying in my boss, and my boss's boss who's with Jeff Wilke, the CEO of retail. And they start asking me questions. And it's just this snowballing, but 7:30 in the morning, Jeff is clearly angry. And there's this list of other people waking up and feeling like, \"Well Jeff is angry, so my job is to be even more angry,\" and it's just raining in on me.\n\nLenny (00:44:14):\nOh man. \n\nEthan Evans (00:44:15):\nSo what did I do? The interesting thing is what do you do when the future richest man in the world is mad at you? He wasn't quite richest man in the world yet, but he was headed there.\n\n(00:44:26):\nSo the first thing I did was I owned it. I said, \"Yes, it's not working. It's my fault. I will deal with it.\" I took ownership. And the second thing I did was start updating him very proactively and saying, \"Here's where we are.\" 8:00 AM, \"This is exactly where we are. This is what we're going to do and the next hour, and this is when you'll get your next update. I will update you again at 9:00 AM, so here's our plan.\"\n\n(00:44:55):\nAnd even though Jeff had sort of lost trust in me, like it's down, and it's not right, and I'm mad, given that he agreed with the plan, he was willing to give me 60 minutes. And then I would update him again and say, \"Okay, this is what we've done and this is what we're going to do, and we'll update you again at 10:00 AM.\" So I was buying life one hour at a time.\n\n(00:45:17):\nNow the other thing I did, and this is a good thing about Amazon, as more and more leaders got copied into this angry thread, they started reaching out in back channel and saying, \"We've all been under Jeff's Eye of Sauron, we know it's miserable. What can we do to help?\" And essentially Andy Jassy's organization, which was AWS at that time, and his CTO, a guy named Werner Vogels said, \"You're having a database problem, let's get you some principal engineers from the AWS database team.\" \n\n(00:45:54):\nAnd these principal engineers showed up at 9:00 AM roughly, and they looked at our design. We had made some fundamental mistakes in our database usage and they said, \"It's too complicated to fix this. We're just going to give you 500 AWS machines so that your crappy design will run anyway. That's the immediate fix.\" And I'm like, \"Okay, well I guess if you have 500 databases lying around because you're AWS, it's a great solution,\" and that's what they did.\n\n(00:46:27):\nSo the next step is we fixed the problem. A bunch of us worked together very hard to get the problem all fixed. Now it took all day, and Jeff was still frustrated because the opportunity to sort of control the messaging and the media by having his letter up had passed. People had noticed our launch and the articles had been written, and so Jeff was still very mad.\n\n(00:46:52):\nSo we fixed the problem, but Jeff now had no trust in us. The weekend went by. He was using the system looking for bugs because he is like, \"This team's not reliable now. Ethan's not reliable. I better check it myself.\" So you have the CEO checking on you.\n\n(00:47:11):\nAnd he found a problem and emailed me like Saturday night at 9:00 like, \"I was doing this and it broke.\" And luckily I was able",

Anyway, the next part of the story is that following week, I had a meeting with him on another topic.\n\n(00:47:32):\nSo I was part of this small group that was trying to figure out how to build a competing browser. You may not remember, but Amazon had a browser called Silk for a while. And I was invited to this meeting, but I wasn't a critical participant. So you may know this idea from Scrum where they say some people are pigs and some are chickens, and the chickens are sort of observers. I was a chicken in this meeting, and that turns out to be a great analogy because I was thinking, should I chicken out and not go? I could skip this meeting with the CEO who's angry at me. But when I had that thought, I realized if I can't face the CEO, I'd better pack my desk. That's the end. \n\n(00:48:13):\nSo I went to this meeting early, and Jeff always sat in the same chair, so I knew where he would sit when he came in. So I sat down right next to his chair and I thought, \"I don't know, let's find out.\"\n\n(00:48:24):\nAnd so the meeting goes by, and of course in my mind Jeff is totally ignoring me, not even looking at me. But I think that's just me projecting, because remember I wasn't central to the meeting.\n\n(00:48:35):\nSo at the end of the meeting, everybody gets up to leave. He turns and looks at me and says, \"So how are you doing? I bet it's been a hard week.\" And I thought, \"Oh, okay, we're going to talk.\" And I said, \"Yeah,\" I just sort of answered him with, \"Of course it's been hard, but here's what we're doing and here's what we're going to do in the future.\" And we had a very human conversation. And I didn't believe Jeff would've forgotten that I let him down, but it was clear he had forgiven it. \n\n(00:49:05):\nSo I was still going to have to, as it turns out, re-earn his trust. But the thing I did that's key for people to learn from is it's really easy to flame. He had been flaming me, writing angry emails. Angry emails are easy. Sitting three feet from someone and being angry with them face-to-face is hard. And when faced with, I can either start ranting at this person who reports to me, or I can say something nice, he chose to say something nice, and that rebuilt our relationship.\n\n(00:49:42):\nSo the end of the story is two years later, I was promoted to vice president. So even though I had failed the CEO on this very public launch where he was very definitely mad at me, I re-earned the trust, I showed I had learned the lessons of how to launch more reliably without outages, and I was promoted.\n\n(00:50:07):\nAnd so I share that story because I think what I want people to understand is if I can get away with publicly failing one of the richest and most famous inventors on earth, and then get promoted and finish my career at Amazon very successfully, you can dig out of any hole. You just have to manage it right.\n\nLenny (00:50:30):\nThat is an amazing story. So there's a lot of lessons that I want to pull on here. One is just if you get caught in a situation like this where something completely fails, what I took down as you were talking, one is admit, yes, this is a huge problem, own it. This is like, don't try to deflect.\n\n(00:50:47):\nTwo is the way I describe what you did here, is something I call prioritizing and communicating, where you prioritize, \"Here's what we need to do,\" and then communicate. \"Here's our priorities.\" And I love that you have this every hour, \"Here's the latest, here's the latest.\" So make people understand you are on it and you'll continue to keep them updated. I imagine one of the worst fears is I have no idea what's happening here. I'm going to go in and start micromanaging.\n\nEthan Evans (00:51:11):\nYou're exactly right. I'm trying to hold off micromanagement. I'm trying to give them, \"Okay, I believe with this and I can wait an hour,\" and then I can wait an another hour because that team seems to be on it. So I'm trying to rebuild trust one hour at a time, and avoid having three or four levels of management all come in and start helping.\n\nLenny (00:51:31):\nThen I love this other piece of advice of meet them in person, try to take it offline essentially, which I know you did later. But that's such a good point that it's hard to be as mad, and angry, and flamey in person. People are just going to be like, \"Okay, I get it. Let's try to figure this out.\" Amazing. Is there anything else? Those are the three that I took away. Just like if you're caught in that situation in the moment, is there anything else that you found to be really helpful?\n\nEthan Evans (00:51:55):\nI",

Just like if you're caught in that situation in the moment, is there anything else that you found to be really helpful?\n\nEthan Evans (00:51:55):\nI mean, work hard and fast, right? You do have to fix the problem. My team had been up all night. I had to start sending people home to sleep in shifts. We had to pull in all this help. And so it was a very hard weekend.\n\n(00:52:10):\nWhen you have a mistake, it's on you to pull out the stops, even if it's uncomfortable to recover from it. And again, this is not the time to be like, \"Well, it's the weekend now, and my team, we'll hit it Monday.\" I'd have been out the door so fast, I would've had the comic Wile E. Coyote skid marks as I bumped down the street. So I would say that's important. It's part of showing ownership.\n\nLenny (00:52:39):\nThe other part of this is something I went through for a while when I was starting to become a more senior leader is I had a lot of imposter syndrome, and this fear that if I messed up, everything would crumble. People would see that I don't actually know what I'm doing, and I'm not really ready for this level of seniority. And so there's this fear of one big mistake, it's over. Clearly this was an example of a huge mistake and it was not over for you. Is there any lessons there that you take away of you can mess up and still do well, even if it's this level of mistake?\n\nEthan Evans (00:53:11):\nI think a lot of people in my position would've quit. They would've let the shame... I was just a little bit bullheaded where I'm like, \"Yeah, I messed up. But I know I'm still a good person and a good worker. Yes, I made a mistake, but I'm going to move on.\" Part of the story I haven't told that you might enjoy is I mentioned that Jeff Wilke was Jeff's number two at that point. Jeff Bezos, number two person, and he was my skip level. \n\n(00:53:38):\nWell, during this process, he came physically into our offices and he wanted to talk to me, and my manager who was vice president said, \"Hey Jeff, this is my team. I own it. If you have any criticism, say it to me. You don't mean to talk to my team.\" And Jeff Wilke said to my boss, whose name was Paul, \"Paul, that's excellent leadership. I really appreciate what you're doing. Please step out of the way. I want to talk to Ethan. You're doing a great job, Paul. Now step aside.\" And then he kind of read me the riot act.\n\n(00:54:15):\nAnd the rest of that funny story is I was so happy with how well my meeting with Jeff Bezos went, I patted myself on the back and like, \"I'm going to go face Jeff Wilke now. I'm going to schedule a meeting with him and do the same thing. I've got this down.\"\n\n(00:54:31):\nSo I go to meet with Jeff Wilke, figuring I'm going to run the same playbook. I'm going to look him in the eye and all will be forgiven. And Jeff Wilke looks at me and says, \"Ethan, when you launched this, did you know you were gambling with the result? Did you know it might not work?\" And I said, \"Yes. We had a media commitment to launch on that day, and I thought shooting for the date was more important than perfect certainty.\"\n\n(00:54:55):\nAnd he said, \"Well, two things. First, you were wrong. You were wrong to prioritize date over our reputation. You let Amazon down in public and that was a mistake.\" He said, \"Second though, at least you knew you were gambling. If you hadn't known you were gambling, we'd be discussing your departure.\" And I'm like, \"Okay.\" Here I thought I was rolling in this meeting like I'm going to run my relationship playbook. And he's evaluating whether or not to keep me.\n\n(00:55:25):\nThe bullheadedness is even after he had told me he had been considering firing me, I'm like, \"Well he isn't. So I'm just going to go forward.\" And a lot of that stubbornness of sure I made a mistake, but I'm not going to live in shame about it, I think is what people can take away. I think a lot of people feel they're more dead in the water than they are. \n\n(00:55:53):\nBecause everybody makes mistakes, right? I mean Jeff and Fire Phone, that'll be an albatross around his neck. Jeff and Fire Phone will be a phrase of anybody who knows Amazon for the rest of his life.\n\nLenny (00:56:08):\nYeah, we talked about it on the Working Backwards podcast, and why didn't Working Backwards work for the Fire Phone, we talked about it. I love that these quotes and lines are so seared in your brain. You can remember it like word for word exactly what-\n\nEthan Evans (00:56:20):\nWell, I've relived that moment many times.\n\nLenny (00:56:26):\nAnd then just along the lines of working your way out of the hole, is essentially what you did just succeed for two years and do great, and",

I've always been sort of an operational cowboy, meaning I like to go fast and loose. I prioritize speed, and I really had to step back and say, \"Okay, Amazon at this level and scale doesn't like that.\" So I've taught myself a new phrase which was fear the New York Times headline. Be aware that if Amazon is down, it goes up on every news website immediately. And so if Amazon has some kind of mistake, it's on Wall Street Journal and CNN.\n\n(00:57:07):\nAnd so as a leader, I had to think, is what I'm doing going to generate a New York Times headline? Because if it is, I'd better be really careful. And that's what I taught myself is you can't be paralyzed, but I taught my whole team, we don't want to be in the New York Times for the wrong thing. And that was the lesson\n\nLenny (00:57:32):\nAlong the lines of lessons, last question here, what's something that you took away from the way you approached it that you should have changed or should have done differently, that you've done differently since? Obviously don't... You mentioned this idea of don't promise a date that you're not that certain you're going to hit. I guess is there anything along those lines?\n\nEthan Evans (00:57:52):\nI have two things here. First, Amazon loved in the past, they loved surprise launches. They love the idea of we're going to be quiet, quiet, quiet. Because basically it was a reaction I think to Microsoft where they felt Microsoft always talked about what was coming and then pushed the dates back. And so there was this whole thing about vaporware. And Amazon wanted to be the other way, which is we won't say anything and then it will just be there. The problem I came to say is the biggest thing I learned with surprise launches is that you're surprised by what doesn't work. \n\n(00:58:23):\nAnd so I shifted the approach to let's do a lot of beta testing. We always, even if others don't agree quite and say, \"You're right, we're not going to have a surprise launch.\" Some of our beta testers, even if they sign NDAs are going to leak. And that's a better outcome than launching something that doesn't work. That's one lesson.\n\n(00:58:46):\nThe other lesson is this thing that broke in front of Jeff Bezos, ultimately it was a new college graduate engineer who wrote that code. And he had been left alone to write part of our user interface, but he had written it in such a way that it didn't scale. Now we didn't give him any help or oversight. We left him on his own, because we were busy focusing on other pieces of the problem.\n\n(00:59:20):\nAnd shortly after the disaster, he left the company. And the mistake I made was not reaching out to him and really reassuring him of, \"Yes, you wrote the bug, but that's not on you. The system failed you and we don't see you. Bugs happen.\"\n\n(00:59:38):\nSo the thing I regret in this whole thing is not realizing that even though no one in the team ever yelled at him or whatever, he knew it was his bug, and he obviously saw me and others sort of taking a beating. And so he left, and I wish he hadn't done that. And I wish more than that I had stepped in. I didn't realize what he was feeling.\n\nLenny (01:00:05):\nIt's interesting, the lesson there isn't catch that person sooner, and notice these links in the chain that may break. But it's more just be there for that human that have this challenge, that people may not be focusing on.\n\nEthan Evans (01:00:19):\nBecause we lost a good person, and he probably felt very bad about it. And we all feel bad when we make mistakes. That can't be prevented. But he felt undue responsibility I think, and that I really regret.\n\nLenny (01:00:35):\nThis is actually a really good example of ownership. You mentioned this term ownership and that connects to... Amazon has these leadership principles. I think there's 14 of them. One of them is around ownership. And apparently you helped craft the actual language for that principle, which I think is a huge deal with Amazon. I imagine very few people have a say over how to define, and describe, and say these principles. Could you just talk about this principle that you contributed to, how it came to be that you helped actually write it?\n\nEthan Evans (01:01:08):\nAmazon is now kind of on its fourth version in my mind, maybe there's more. But its fourth major revision of its leadership principles over its 25 plus year history.\n\n(01:01:18):\nAnd when it was going from version one to version two, Jeff and his leadership team sat down together. And actually in version one, there were three different lists. They were leadership principles and core values, and something else I don't remember. And they were like, \"Three lists is stupid. Let's make one list.\"\n\n(01:01:36):\nWell ownership, the term had been a part of one of those lists, but when they merged",

Let's make one list.\"\n\n(01:01:36):\nWell ownership, the term had been a part of one of those lists, but when they merged everything, they took it out. And this guy Jeff Wilke I mentioned, the number two and the leader of retail, he brought a bunch of us a bunch of his directors. He brought the proposed list to us in a meeting and said, \"Hey, this is the proposed new version, do you have any comment?\" And we all sat around and talked and said, \"Where's ownership? Ownership is missing.\" So we told him, he said, \"Look, ownership is missing. We think it should be there.\" And he said, \"Well, why don't you propose a draft?\"\n\n(01:02:15):\nAnd so about a half dozen of us sat around and roughed out a draft of how we felt ownership should be written. And I proposed these six words, which are, \"An owner never says that's not my job.\" Maybe that's seven words.\n\n(01:02:36):\nSo I propose this specific language as a part of it and we sent off this draft. And months go by, we hear nothing. And then one day the leadership principles are announced and ownership is back in. It's been modified, but that, \"An owner never says that's not my job,\" is a part of the leadership principle, and it's remained to this debt. \n\n(01:02:58):\nAnd what I love about that is because Amazon has one and a half million employees who live by these leadership principles, it's probably the most impactful thing I've ever written.\n\nLenny (01:03:11):\nWow. So those seven words are the most impactful thing you've ever written. I love that and I totally get that. I'm looking at the principles right now and it comes right at the end of that principle. We'll link to the 14 leadership principles. Is there another principle that you really love or one or two? I don't know. It's probably hard to pick your favorites.\n\nEthan Evans (01:03:28):\nI'm a huge proponent of bias for action. Bias for action says speed matters in business and many decisions are reversible. And so it's important to go faster. \n\n(01:03:41):\nAnd I think people don't understand that in a competitive environment, being right is good, but being quick is necessary. Because if there are 10 startups working on an idea, some of them will gamble, and they'll make bad gambles, and they'll go out of business. But some of them will gamble and make an early bet and be right. And if you are not moving quickly, you'll be beaten by the people who maybe got lucky. \n\n(01:04:05):\nAnd so you've got to have a process that values speed, values, what can we do today? What can we commit to today? So I really like bias for action. Now that is what got me in trouble with Jeff, right? I was willing to gamble. So it has to be in balance, but that's my other favorite.\n\nLenny (01:04:25):\nAgain, the Jeff Bezos interview with Lex Fridman, he was talking about how with Blue Origin, with the way Amazon, he thought about Amazon is customer obsession. That was the core goal and differentiator of Amazon. With Blue Origin, he wants it to be decisiveness. It's basically leaning into this bias for action fully, which is really interesting.\n\nEthan Evans (01:04:44):\nI saw that part of the interview and I thought, \"Wow, that's exactly right.\" Because again, rockets blow up and they have people on them. You've got to get it right, but you also have to keep moving, because there's always one more thing you can safety test. So how do you balance it?\n\nLenny (01:05:04):\nYeah, it's interesting. With rockets, that's the one that you pick. It's pretty bold to be all move forward kind of thing. So this principle, again, going back to ownership, so you basically suggested this phrase, \"You didn't hear anything,\" and all of a sudden it becomes part of the whole thing. Did that feel weird that they never told you, or I don't know if they gave you credit for that, or it's like, no, it's great?\n\nEthan Evans (01:05:24):\nYeah, I wouldn't even claim credit for it, except I kept a copy of the email that says, \"Ethan thinks it should say blah.\" I have the written proof. Because it's not about the credit. I'm very happy and proud that those words were kept. But in Amazon, I doubt if Jeff knows I wrote those words. It's not like I've ever told him, \"Hey, do you know you kept my words?\" That's not appropriate. It's just a fun anecdote.\n\n(01:05:55):\nAnd it does show, I guess something people can learn from that though, you can influence way up in a company if your ideas are good. And also, when we challenged, Jeff Wilke was a strong opinionated leader who didn't necessarily always love being challenged.\n\n(01:06:15):\nAnd so when we first told him, \"Well, we think you're missing ownership,\" he was like, \"You're staying that the whole S team can't get its leadership principles right?\" I mean it wasn't exactly that way, but he was very much like, \"Well, is this really necessary? Why do you think it's necessary",

That's not a great example of leadership where he is like, \"Hey guys, I need your feedback on this thing. But no, don't actually tell me anything's wrong.\"\n\nEthan Evans (01:06:57):\nWell, yeah. I mean for a bunch of directors to kind of critique the work of people two levels higher, he wanted it, but then he's sort of naturally resistant to it if we're kind of poking at his baby.\n\nLenny (01:07:14):\nIt's unlikely that there's something huge missing and it turns out there was.\n\nEthan Evans (01:07:18):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:07:19):\nAnd I guess just on these principles, people may not know this, but this is where disagree and commit comes from. It's actually have backbone, disagree, and commit. We talked about this on the podcast about working backwards. I also love leaders are right a lot. That comes up a lot and I love that, to be successful, you need to be right. You can't just project confidence. You can't just be in a bunch of meetings and ship things. You need to be right to be successful.\n\nEthan Evans (01:07:42):\nAnd that one's been rewritten to carefully say, it's always interesting what is the history of the edits, which you wish you could see the edit history on these. That one got modified to say something about leaders actively work to disconfirm their beliefs.\n\n(01:07:58):\nAnd the key there is it was trying to get at the idea that you've got to be very open and always be questioning, \"Yes, I think I'm right, but what's the new evidence? What am I learning? What's changing?\" And in fact, it also says they seek diverse perspectives.\n\n(01:08:20):\nAnd that was a way of getting at what's called DEI, diversity, equity, and inclusion. That's a subtle nod towards if everyone in the room is a 50-year-old white man, you may not really be making the right overall decision for Amazon's customer base. You may be making the one for 50-year-old white suburban Seattleites. And so it's just some of these, every word in those has been studied as an individual word inside the company.\n\nLenny (01:08:52):\nAmazing. Okay. Let's move on to the final area I wanted to spend a little time on, and this is called contrarian corner. I'm curious if you have any contrarian opinions about things basically that other people believe that you don't believe, something you see that many people don't see. Is there anything that comes to mind?\n\nEthan Evans (01:09:11):\nYeah, I think a place where I'm currently very contrarian is the return to office movement. Many leaders at my level appear or publicly favor the need to get back into the office potentially full-time. \n\n(01:09:27):\nAnd I'm contrarian on this because of innovation. Specifically, I looked it up, you can check my facts on Wikipedia. The first purpose-built office, the first building ever built to be an office was built in 1726 in London. And so we're about 300 years into learning how to use offices well.\n\n(01:09:51):\nAnd what that means is offices aren't going to get much better. What's the last major thing you can think of that got better in offices? You might say well open offices, but a lot of people would say that's not even a good idea. These big rows of desks and loud pits.\n\n(01:10:06):\nWith working from home, we've only been doing that for a few years since the pandemic began and at all since the internet started 20 years ago. Which one is likely to have more opportunity for improvement? There's so many things we haven't explored with remote work. And I think the people who say, \"Back to the office, it's because we know it works,\" well we know what it is, but I have so much more faith in the opportunity to improve the remote experience. And so I think long-term, it's going to triumph.\n\n(01:10:40):\nThe one other place where I'm a huge contrarian is doing business on a handshake. I understand companies need lawyers, and I have an attorney for certain things. But I coach people. Most of the people I coach, there's no NDA in place. There's no contract in place.

And the other place I'm contrarian is just doing business on faith.\n\nLenny (01:11:32):\nThat reminds me, Sam Altman has a similar philosophy of just trust people and assume it'll all be okay. Sometimes you'll get burned, but on balance, it'll end up being much better for you and for everyone around you. \n\nEthan Evans (01:11:42):\nI didn't know that Sam had said that, but I strongly agree with it.\n\nLenny (01:11:45):\nYeah, although he had some challenges recently. I don't know if it's working great, but it ended upgrade for him. So anyway, okay. We've actually reached our very exciting lightning round. Before we get there, is there anything else you wanted to touch on, or share, or leave listeners with?\n\nEthan Evans (01:12:01):\nNo, I've really enjoyed this conversation. I could talk about careers forever and I love doing that, but I think we've covered a ton today that will really help people. So I'm good. Let's hit the lightning round.\n\nLenny (01:12:14):\nAll right. With that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nEthan Evans (01:12:19):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:12:20):\nEthan, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nEthan Evans (01:12:25):\nTwo or three books. My number one recommendation is a book called Decisive. It's by Chip and Dan Heath, and it's about the science of making better decisions. The reason I recommend it so much is it will make your career better because leaders are decision makers, but also your personal life. So I apply it at least as much in my personal life as I do in my professional life. \n\n(01:12:47):\nMy second most recommended book is Leadership and Self Deception, much less known than Decisive, a little bit harder to approach. It's by a group, a research group called the Arbinger Institute, and it's about, the self-deception is we cause a lot of our interpersonal problems while blaming them on others. And it walks through how are you part of the problem you're having with somebody else and what can you do about it?\n\n(01:13:14):\nThe third and final book was recently brought to me by someone I work with that you know, Jason [inaudible 01:13:21]. That book is The Almanack Of Naval Ravikant. And Naval Ravikant is an angel investor responsible for AngelList. \n\n(01:13:30):\nBut what I love about that book is he has a recipe. He really boils down how to be successful while loving what you do. And he says, \"No one can be a better version of you.\" Don't try to copy me and be, \"I'm going to be like Ethan, or I'm going to be like Lenny.\" Instead, figure out what you uniquely do best that you love, because no one can copy you being you. And that's your defensible sort of career value. And I really like that mental model.\n\nLenny (01:14:03):\nYeah, Naval has so many insightful messages, and you can read all these on his Twitter. We'll link to his Twitter, and someone just made a book out of his tweets basically. He's such an interesting dude.\n\nEthan Evans (01:14:13):\nYes, that's right.\n\nLenny (01:14:14):\nAwesome. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nEthan Evans (01:14:19):\nSo I grew up on a farm, and so all the Taylor Sheridan, 1923, and Yellowstone, and all of those series, we've watched everything he's put out. We do kind of laugh like, wow. Are you familiar with Yellowstone at all?\n\nLenny (01:14:37):\nAbsolutely. A lot of death.\n\nEthan Evans (01:14:39):\nYeah. At one point my wife and I were watching it, we would start betting. So the episode is starting, how many people will die in this episode? This ranch in Montana, but yet somehow they're always killing people. How does this work?\n\nLenny (01:14:55):\nThat's what your life was like, is what I'm hearing. Favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?\n\nEthan Evans (01:15:03):\nI think my favorite interview question is, \"Tell me about a time where you needed to disagree with your management, where you needed to stand up or fight for a position against higher leadership or people in power.\" Because I think that's really hard to do. I'm normally interviewing leaders, and I think having a bunch of people who just say yes isn't helpful. You need people to have, as you said, have backbone, disagree and commit. So that's what I'm normally looking for.\n\nLenny (01:15:33):\nAwesome. Is there favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nEthan Evans (01:15:38):\nIt's silly, but my favorite product that I've discovered recently is the Chuckit!, which you use to whip a ball for your dog a quarter mile. It basically extends your arm. And it's just fun to send a ball soaring way further than you could ever throw it. And you feel like, \"Wow, look at me. I'm a major league pitcher.\" Because I have this three foot lever arm and",

It basically extends your arm. And it's just fun to send a ball soaring way further than you could ever throw it. And you feel like, \"Wow, look at me.

It's too easy to say ChatGPT and stuff, so I won't go there.\n\nLenny (01:16:16):\nAwesome. My dog does not love chasing balls, so I haven't had a reason to buy that, but I've never thought about just the joy of flicking a ball really far. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with folks, find useful in work or in life?\n\nEthan Evans (01:16:31):\nI happen to be a Christian, and the motto that I think about the most is, \"To whom much has been given, from him much will be required.\" And so I think a lot about what is my social responsibility. \n\n(01:16:44):\nI've been very lucky. I grew up on a farm in Ohio now. I wasn't a farm boy, my father was a chemist. But I grew up in upper middle class settings, and I've ended up being extremely successful, able to retire from my job at 50 to kind of coach and teach. What do I owe to pay forward? So those words are obviously ancient spiritual texts, but they're the ones I take away and think the most about. What's my responsibility?\n\nLenny (01:17:11):\nAs an example of someone that to whom much has been given, but because he's worked so hard, Jeff Bezos is starting a space business as you know. If you had the chance to go to space, would you go?\n\nEthan Evans (01:17:22):\nWell, I of course saw his interview where he talked about how he thought about the safety and the conversation he had to have with his mother. I would like to go to space. I'm not willing to pay what I think the current tickets are, but I would take the risk. So what's the risk of that ride? One in a hundred, one in 50, even more that you won't come back. I would probably take the gamble.\n\nLenny (01:17:46):\nSo you'd be an early adopter? Where along that curve would you be, an early adopter, laggard?\n\nEthan Evans (01:17:50):\nWell, I'm old enough that I remember when the Challenger space shuttle exploded, and I said I would get on the next one and I said, \"They're never going to be more careful than the next one, so I'll get on the next one.\"\n\n(01:18:04):\nSo I think I would get on any one I was offered because of the chance. Unlike Jeff who claims he wasn't scared, I would probably be really terrified, at least at liftoff. While you're up there, it's great. Everything either goes wrong going up or coming down. It's not the middle.\n\nLenny (01:18:25):\nEthan, I think we're going to help a lot of people with their career. I think we're going to help them work through failure, become better owners. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? Also, just share what you do now in case people could use that help. And then how can listeners useful to you?\n\nEthan Evans (01:18:42):\nSo the best place to find me online, I do all my writing on LinkedIn. It's where the professional community is. So Ethan Evans on LinkedIn. My actual handle there is Ethan Evans VP for my history as a vice president. That's the best place to find me. I do have a Substack newsletter. I do teach through the Maven platform, but all of those are linked off LinkedIn.\n\n(01:19:02):\nAnd really, how readers help me, they comment on what I write, because I miss things. I am one person's perspective. And so I actually have a process where I take in all the comments people write, all the different perspectives, all the different exceptions, or special cases, or examples, and that's how I improve my own thinking is I read every comment and think, \"Okay, what did I miss? What could I have said better? How can I incorporate this if I ever talk about this again?\"\n\nLenny (01:19:31):\nJust to give you another opportunity to plug the stuff you do now, what do you help people with in case people could value could you use the stuff that you offer? You said you coach, you have a course. What sort of stuff?\n\nEthan Evans (01:19:40):\nI focus on two topics, career development. So how do you row in your career, the whole Magic Loop, and how do you attain promotion or attain a new role raise if that's your goal? And then leadership specifically. I teach a course that's been very popular called Stuck at Senior Manager - Breaking Through To Executive, which is how to get out of that sort of stuck, \"I'm working really hard, I'm pretty good. I'm managing 25 or 50 people, but how do I get to the big chair? How do I get to the division level leadership and what do I need to change?\" It's that whole what got you here won't get you there. And I love to see people succeed at that. People write me back and say, \"I did get a job. I",

Growth sometimes gets this reputation that it's just pure metrics hacking.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:08):\nYou've worked at three of the most successful consumer subscription products in the world. What do you think is the biggest missing piece that people don't get about building a successful consumer subscription product?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:00:18):\nUser retention is gold for consumer subscription companies. If you don't retain your users, then a lot of the onus is on getting them to pay on day one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):\nNoam Levinsky, he said that I need to ask you about the biggest monetization win that you found at Grammarly.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:00:31):\nThe lived product experience for most of the free users was that Grammarly was just a product to fix your spelling and grammar because those were the free suggestions. What if we actually sampled a number of different paid suggestions and interspersed them to free users across their writing? All of a sudden, people were seeing Grammarly as a much more powerful tool than they were before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):\nWhat's the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building teams?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:00:54):\nI saw some of the highest performers just being people that had very high agency, had that clock speed, had that energy, but they didn't necessarily need to have deep experience on that matter. Sometimes experience could be a crutch, especially in this world where the grounds are shifting so fast with AI. A lot of your learned habits actually need to be intentionally discarded.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:13):\nToday my guest is Albert Cheng. Albert is known as one of the top consumer growth minds in the world. He led growth and monetization at three of the most successful and beloved consumer products in the world, Duolingo, Grammarly, and now Chess.com. Earlier in his career at YouTube, he worked on streaming and gaming features used by over 20 million people.\n\n(00:01:32):\nHis unique approach to growth blends marketing, data, strategy, and product management, and in our conversation, we cover a lot of ground, including his explore and exploit framework to find growth opportunities. His biggest and most interesting growth wins at Duolingo, Grammarly and Chess.com, how he uses AI to accelerate his growth work, what he's come to realize about the power of brand and community in your growth work, his top experimentation, best practices, why his goal at every company is to run 1,000 experiments a year and so much more.\n\n(00:02:02):\nA huge thank you to Erik Allebest, Noam Levinsky, and Jorge Mazal for suggesting topics for this conversation.

So as I do for every podcast conversation, I reached out to a bunch of people that you've worked with that know you well to find out what to ask you about and what topics to spend time on. Jorge Mazal, who is famous in my world for writing, what was for the longest time, the most popular newsletter post on my newsletter, it's actually people have usurped it now, but it was stuck there for a long time. So here's what he wrote. \"It is a mystery to me how Albert is able to do what he does. I am actually eager to listen to this episode and learn from him.\"\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:05:10):\nThat is super nice. Thank you, Jorge. I've learned so much from him. I'm the type of weird person that likes to wake up before their kids and pull up a bunch of browser tabs and look at experiments. So it was perfect that Jorge brought me into the growth world at Duolingo, learned a ton of best practices, and he's just a great guy. Thanks, Jorge.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:27):\nWe're already getting into these tactics. I love it. Let me just give a little framing on what I want to do with this conversation. What I want to try to do is to help people learn tools and mental models for finding growth opportunities for their own products and essentially learn the growth mentality that you bring into the companies and products that you work on.\n\n(00:05:48):\nWhat I want to start with is to give us a little insight into how you became what you became. There's an interesting pattern I found across a bunch of recent guests, which is many people were very good at piano when they were younger and were very serious piano players. For example, Head of ChatGPT, Nick Turley was almost going to become professional jazz pianist. You were very serious as a piano player earlier in your career. How did you go from pianist to one of the top growth minds in the world briefly?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:06:18):\nWell, that's very flattering, but I appreciate it. Yeah, I grew up playing a lot of piano. My parents were immigrants from Taiwan and I was the oldest kid that they had, and so I definitely felt that strong encouragement, if you will, to learn a bunch of things, take them seriously, study hard, and so I did. And my parents, even though they weren't musically proficient, they had a deep love for classical music.\n\n(00:06:45):\nSo I was the stereotypical baby that would listen to Mozart, I guess when I was sleeping type of thing. And I still vividly remember we had this upright Yamaha piano, and at the very top of the piano we had this countdown clock from 90 minutes. Literally every single day of my childhood, just practice really, really consistently.\n\n(00:07:04):\nAt first, I really was irritated by that thing, but as I grew older, I started to appreciate music quite a bit more. But anyway, I think what really accelerated my interest and abilities in piano was I feel like I hit the lottery. I had perfect pitch, and so I was able to quickly understand whether I was playing the right stuff or the wrong stuff and just pick up music pretty rapidly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:29):\nWhat does perfect pitch even mean? Does that mean which note is playing?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:07:29):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:29):\nOkay.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:07:34):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:34):\nWow.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:07:35):\nSo I could listen to a song and then just a very, very clear understanding of which note I'm supposed to start with and if I'm playing something wrong. So it's very helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:35):\nUnfair.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:07:44):\nIt's unfair. Definitely. So anyway, yeah, I got quite good as a teenager in high school and even considered studying at a music conservatory. My intrinsic motivation for music wasn't necessarily as strong at that point, and so I decided to go to engineering school instead, but that would've been an incredibly different career. And to your original point around the relationship between music and growth, I didn't really reflect on this until recently.\n\n(00:08:12):\nI have a four-year-old and I'm starting to teach him how to bang on the keys a little bit, but a couple things stand out. One is that I think music and growth, they both rely on this just consistent repetition. You're constantly making mistakes. You have this super tight feedback loop. You have to get really resilient to just making mistakes all the time. And you know that the way of learning is through those mistakes. So that's a thing that I learned very early, and the second thing that occurred to me is that they both have this structural underpinning to them.\n\n(00:08:45):\nWith growth, you have a growth model, you have metrics, you have experiments, you have channels, things like that. But you also need on a day-to-day basis to have creativity, you got to come up with interesting solutions or hypotheses to test. And the same is true on the music side. You have music theory of scales and stuff, but to create beautiful music, you need that passion, that emotion, that flow. So I think that's the beautiful combination between the two.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00",

But you also need on a day-to-day basis to have creativity, you got to come up with interesting solutions or hypotheses to test. And the same is true on the music side. You have music theory of scales and stuff, but to create beautiful music, you need that passion, that emotion, that flow. So I think that's the beautiful combination between the two.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:09):\nFun fact, my wife bought me piano/singing lessons for Father's Day recently, and I've gotten really into this stuff. So I'm learning how to play very basic piano now and learning to identify notes and hit notes with my voice.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:09:24):\nNice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:25):\nWhat a weird new thing.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:09:25):\nCould be your next act.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:26):\nIt could be. I could go the reverse, I could become a professional piano player. Oh man. No, it's so fun, so hard though. I'm just like, my fingers are like, how do you do four freaking keys at once? I'm just like \"What is going on here?\" Okay, so let's get into the meat of it. I want to talk about growth.\n\n(00:09:42):\nThere's a very specific framework that as we were chatting that I think would be really helpful for people to hear and learn from you. You call it explore and exploit. I think there's a bunch of different ways to think about this. Talk about this framework and how that informs the way you think about growth.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:09:56):\nYeah, I initially came up or heard with, heard about explore and exploit through my engineering partner at Grammarly, Nermal, and I think he actually had taken some reforged classes. So maybe the original inventor of it might be Brian Balfour, who I know has been on your pod. But anyway, it's a great concept.\n\n(00:10:13):\nThe gist of it is that when you're in exploratory mode, think of it as finding the right mountain to climb. And then when you're in exploitation mode, it's like focusing your resources on climbing that mountain effectively. And certain companies, I think the warning is to basically spend too much of your time on one end of the spectrum. If you do too much exploration, you can have your team feel a little bit too scattershot, just trying a hundred different random ideas.\n\n(00:10:40):\nWhat's the through line? What's the strategy? How do you pattern match successes across them? And if you do too much in exploitation, which is often the MO of growth teams, it can lead to this saturation and stagnation where you're just locally maximizing a thing. And even though this principle of explore and exploit, it's typically thought of as a macro thing. I like to work with my teams more on the insight level. So I'll give you a concrete example.\n\n(00:11:07):\nSo I work at chess.com and one of our priorities is to encourage chess players to improve, to learn and improve. So one of the PMs that we have, Dylan, he works on all the learning features. The most used learning feature in our product is called game review. So you play a game of chess, after the game is over, we have this virtual coach that teaches you about your worst moves, best moves, et cetera. And his job is to improve user engagement and retention.\n\n(00:11:34):\nAnd so he's in this exploratory phase trying to figure out how do I drive more of that type of activity? And what he observes is that 80% of people that review their games actually do so after a win. And that's really counterintuitive to when we initially built the feature. We thought that people would want to use it after losses or to see their mistakes such they could work on their mistakes. That turned out not to be the truth when it came to the human psychology and the actual data of it. And so we made some changes in the product experience.\n\n(00:12:04):\nWhen you lose a game now as opposed to surfacing your blunders and your horrible stuff that you did, we flip it on its head and so we show you your brilliant moves, your best moves, and we have coach say something encouraging, \"Losing, just part of learning, keep it up.\" That type of thing. That change alone was pretty dramatic for us.\n\n(00:12:22):\nIt grew game reviews by 25%, subscriptions by 20%, user retention by a lot as well. So that was fantastic, but the point is that it doesn't just stop there. You have to take that insight, share it broadly across the company. Now, adjacent product managers like the PM working on puzzles can now think about, \"Okay, how do I audit these cold patterns in my product and think about making them more positive?\"\n\n(00:12:48):\nI can change the success rating, I could tweak some copy, change the color of some buttons, and so you now can take this experiment win and expand it out 10X across your organization and that's the kind of exploitation phase of it. So when done right, you can oscillate between the two until you saturate out of exploitation mode and then you encourage the teams to brainstorm and get more creative again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:11):\nAmazing. Okay, so there's a lot here to follow up on. One is the core piece of advice when you find something that works really well, find ways to build on that learning. One is here's an insight, it can apply to other parts of the product.",

Okay, so there's a lot here to follow up on. One is the core piece of advice when you find something that works really well, find ways to build on that learning. One is here's an insight, it can apply to other parts of the product. \"Hey teams, here's something we learned unexpected. Maybe this can help you. Also, just keep find more, run more experiments in the same zone.\" I imagine is a part of that.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:13:34):\nYeah, exactly right. In my experience, the typical win rate, and I hate to use that term for experiments, is often something like 30 to 50%. Usually you're trying a bunch of things, a lot of hypotheses turn out not to be true, consumer products are very unpredictable like that, but when you do find a thing that breaks through the noise, and it could actually be a hugely losing experiment too, those are also super valuable.\n\n(00:13:58):\nSurfacing those across the company, the original PM running that experiment doesn't necessarily need to be the person that figures out what you should do for all the other parts of your product experience, but the onus is on them to clearly articulate what their hypothesis is, what they found such that then as a growth leader, I can encourage people to swarm around that and try a bunch of different ideas such that the success rate is up and the impact is up. So it's just oscillating back and forth between the two. That is the magic bullet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:30):\nI think another takeaway here/something that I think about when I hear what you're saying is there's often a lot more wins in an area than people expect that you can continue to find wins and growth in something for a long time.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:14:46):\nExactly right. Yes. At the end of the day, users, I think within a company sometimes you can have this siloed approach where you break apart the product experience in 50 different ways and distribute them across different teams, and you assume that users interact with each of the different features with a different mentality, but oftentimes that's actually not necessarily the case. And so sometimes, you can surface an insight that's more human psychology based that can resonate across the entire product experience. And so I think when you can find that, you can double down.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:19):\nPeople hearing this might feel like, \"Okay, yes, find big wins and then find more.\" Is there something you find that helps you figure out when to explore versus when to exploit when you've exploited too far? Just like any heuristics or I don't know, ways of helping people guide them along this process of exploring and exploiting?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:15:41):\nOne thing that I try to focus on at a company of our scale of a chess.com, right? We're running roughly 250 experiments a year. So we're not the highest in the industry, but we run a decent volume. And so when that happens, I invest in these experiment explorer tools and we can talk about AI as well as another way to uncover and pick out these nuggets of wisdom, but basically, these explorer tools can allow me to look across the spectrum of experiments that are going on.\n\n(00:16:08):\nTry to figure out if there are patterns between the hypotheses and the learnings that are happening. And if I'm starting to see more and more experiments that are not statistically significant, that may be a signal to me to say, \"Okay, we might've tried to exploit a little bit too far. There might not be as much juice to squeeze. Hey guys, let's get back to the table and brainstorm and be a little bit more divergent with our thinking.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:34):\nWell, let me follow this thread on AI and how you're using AI to help you figure this out. That is very cool. Talk about that.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:16:40):\nI think one of the latest things that we've been tinkering around with is this text to SQL capability. It's actually pretty powerful. We have this data request Slack channel where for the longest time, and this is still true today, people will toss in all sorts of just one-off questions. How many subscribers do we have in South Africa? Or how long did somebody play puzzles last month or something?\n\n(00:17:07):\nAnd these ad hoc questions, they often take a lot of human time to just go in and a data analyst needs to prioritize it and find time to go run the query. And yes, you can invest in self-serve tooling to improve at this, but also I found that AI is quite good at doing that first pass answer as well. And so we're working on training some of these Slack bots to essentially be the first party provider of a lot of these answers, which makes the company as a whole lot more data informed, I guess.\n\n(00:17:39):\nAnd I think what's also kind of interesting is that just human nature is that if you have a question that you feel like you might be a bit embarrassed to ask or you don't want to bother someone, you just don't ask the question. And so by the nature of having these tools, you get actually a pretty large explosion of questions being asked. And I think you see this in ChatGPT too, right? It's like just having a thing that you can converse with that you feel comfortable in makes a huge difference.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:03):\nOkay, this is extremely cool",

Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:13):\nWhoa, so cool. Okay. Is this something you guys are going to release or is this just like somebody, you guys should just build this at every company?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:18:20):\nWe should. It's a good idea.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:21):\nOkay. Okay. Well, there's an episode where everyone in the comments is like, \"Open source this.\" So we'll see if that happens again. That is very cool. Are there other examples of that kind of stuff that you've done or seen?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:18:32):\nAn adjacent example is a lot of the product managers, we're tinkering around with all sorts of different prototyping tools right now. It's just like go from an idea to a representative solution. Today, there's a lot of humans involved in taking an idea, writing up a spec, doing a review, doing design, et cetera. I'm sure you've interviewed plenty of people that have talked about this specific problem.\n\n(00:18:52):\nAnd so for us, we've invested a bit in at least carving out the main screens of our product experience, things like our onboarding flow, our home screen, our chessboard as an example, and building essentially AI prototypes of those using tools like a V0 or a Lovable. And when you have those foundational pieces, you can then share them with the rest of the company and they can use that as a starting point and then they can try to put their ideas on top of that and then they become a lot more discussable and hopefully testable relatively soon.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:25):\nWhat's in your AI stack along those lines?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:19:27):\nThe PMs are mostly using V0. The designers love Figmas, they're using Figma Make. The engineers are using a combination of tools right now. So Cursor, Cloud Code, GitHub, Copilot. Marketing teams use all sorts of tools for translation, subtitles, content adaptations, et cetera. Customers support uses Intercom then. So there's quite a lot of tools that are used across the company.\n\n(00:19:50):\nI would say though that something that is annoying to me is that we haven't yet figured out the bridging from the tinkering to the workflow quite as seamlessly as I would like. And so each sub-function, even though the common I guess wisdom now is that AI is going to strip away these functional titles. It is true that based on your experience, you may gravitate to using a type of tool more. And if that tool isn't as interoperable with some of the other tools that you need to pass down the chain to actually ship it into production, at least at our scale.\n\n(00:20:24):\nI think for smaller startups, sure, PMs should just go ship it, but for us, we are still doing some handoffs between functions. I expect that to change over time and we are investing in some of design system components and MCPs and stuff to make it a little bit easier. But yeah, it's an investment and it takes time to smooth things out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:42):\nI want to come back to this topic of how things have changed and how you work as a product person, as a growth person across the companies you've been at. But first of all, I want to talk about another example of finding growth wins and monetization wins. Noam Levinsky, who is Chief Product Officer at Grammarly, you worked with him for a while while you were at Grammarly. He said that I need to ask you about the biggest monetization win that you found at Grammarly and how you discovered the opportunity.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:21:10):\nI had the pleasure of working with Noam and his product team at Grammarly. Some context first for those that don't use Grammarly. So Grammarly is an AI-powered writing assistant. And so typically, people will use it as a Chrome extension or a downloadable desktop client. And basically what it does is it overlays your writing with a bunch of different-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:28):\nI use it. I'm a big fan. I use it-\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:21:30):\nCorrection, so you're a big fan.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:30):\n... And it saves my life.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:21:32):\nFantastic. Glad to hear that. Grammarly is a freemium business model, which means that over 90% of our users are on the free service and the rest of it pay for subscriptions essentially, right? And so one of the teams, they work on subscriber conversion, PM there is Kayla, that team is great and their job is to figure out the free to paid subscription path.\n\n(00:21:54):\nAnd so one of the realizations, one, is that we weren't actually tracking the events that well for the types of essentially suggestions that people were getting and how often were users seeing paywalls and",

That's kind of step number one. We have to put that instrumentation in. Step number two is that, \"Hey, we noticed, actually first let me explain some of the logic.\"\n\n(00:22:18):\nSo as a free user, you basically get these underlines across your writing and if you accept all of them, then you see the paywall and that encourages you to subscribe for more nuanced features. As a free user, the main things you get are spelling, grammar, they're basically correctness things. And as a paid user you get that, how do you improve your tone to be more empathetic? How do you improve your writing to be more clear?\n\n(00:22:40):\nHow can you rewrite entire sentences, that type of thing. And so the observed behavior from all that tracking and data was that actually a very small percentage of our free users was deciding to accept all of their suggestions. They were more picking and choosing as they go, and I wonder if your experience is kind of similar too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:59):\nDefinitely, yeah. I'm always like, \"Wait, stop rewriting everything.\" Just like this part is wrong. I will fix it. Yeah, I'm very much a pick and choose.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:23:07):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:07):\nCorrection person.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:23:08):\nAnd then the second thing, which is I think equally if not more interesting is that I was at this company during this generative AI transformation, which is obviously still going on. And quite frankly, both the company brand as well as the lived product experience for most of the free users was that Grammarly was just a product to fix your spelling and grammar because those were the free suggestions we were showing people.\n\n(00:23:34):\nAnd so we decided to flip that on its head entirely and we said, \"Okay, what if we actually sampled a number of different paid suggestions and interspersed them to free users across their writing?\" Such that they were intermingled and we would provide a limited taste of what the paid offering had to provide. And on the surface, even though it's rational, the concern is that if we give too much of this away, then will people want to subscribe?\n\n(00:23:58):\nAnd we found completely that was not the case all of a sudden, people were seeing Grammarly as a much more powerful tool than they were before and our upgrade rates nearly doubled just through this change. And so I think this is interesting, just modernization learning that especially if you work on a freemium product, try to have your free product be a reflection of everything that your product can offer you. Obviously to an extent there's some costs involved with some of the paid features and things like that, but it generally will pay for itself if you're able to put your best foot forward and go do that. So that really worked well for us there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:36):\nI think this is what converted me to being a paid Grammarly subscriber. Wow, what a genius move. So essentially, it's here's a bunch of improvements, but you get three, I think max, and then it's like, \"Okay, now you get upgrade.\"\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:24:51):\nIt's basically a reverse free trial but in real time while you're writing as opposed to a time-based one. So we adopted some patterns that are in the industry, but molded it to Grammarly's specific use case.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:04):\nRight. I was going to ask, so it's not like a full trial, it's like a capped trial where you get a certain number of things and then you run out and then they get refreshed. I think once a day or something like that is what I found.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:25:16):\nYeah, you got it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:18):\nYeah. Grammarly is the best/most devious at their upsells. I'm always just like, \"God damn it, I'm so close to seeing an improvement, I just have to upgrade.\" And it's right there, it's right there where my mouse is.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:25:32):\nYeah, well, I'm not proud of being devious, but.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:33):\nIn really getting me to buy the thing. Good job. What was it? Kayla? Okay, nice job Kayla. It's very effective. I love that. Okay, so in terms of the free trial, I don't know, is there anything there of just, there's always this question of freemium, give things away and then there's pro account, there's like trial versus time. Some features are limited. I don't know, do you have for consumer subscription products like here's the way to go?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:26:00):\nYeah, I think first of all, why do freemium subscription in the first place is a common question that I've joined all these companies that are freemium subscription. What do I like about it I guess? Well one, I think it ties really nicely to mission orientation of a lot of these companies. It's often like you want to spread the product",

What do I like about it I guess? Well one, I think it ties really nicely to mission orientation of a lot of these companies. It's often like you want to spread the product as wide as possible because that's why the founders built the thing, right?\n\n(00:26:22):\nYou're trying to improve education with Duolingo or Grammarly or Chess.com, these are meant to be widespread products with a really wide value proposition that fits globally. And so obviously, the lowest friction to that is going to be a free product. So that alone is part of it. Another part of it is that a lot of these products primarily grow through word of mouth and especially if you can build network effects in the product, like Duolingo has a bunch of social features or with Grammarly, they have a bit of a B2C2B play as well.\n\n(00:26:54):\nSo you see Grammarly being used by teams and by companies and whatnot, and even if users are on the free plan, they still provide quite a lot of value in making sure that Grammarly can be purchased by a coworker or by a team member or whatever. So I think these things are usually why I lean toward make sure that the core value proposition that you're providing users is free and is permanently free and then you layer on a sampling or a taste of some of the premium features that are on top of it. That's usually the sweet spot that I've seen.\n\n(00:27:26):\nAs to the trials, reverse trials type of thing, I think it largely depends. I think if you have especially a B2B feature where you may have some lock-in, reverse trials can be super powerful. You just want to get people in there. You don't need to ask for their credit card because they're using your CRM or they're investing quite a lot of time in building out material and content. And so by the time that window drops, you actually feel, \"Oh man, I probably should keep this and start paying.\" I think for a lot of consumer products it's a little bit harder for that to work. And so I've typically seen more just normal free trials be the norm.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:03):\nLet me follow this thread of just consumer subscription products. I feel like this is the category that every indie developer dreams of building a product in because it's easy to build. Cool, I'll build an app, I add a paywall, and then they realize this is a lot harder than I thought. From a perspective of distribution and CAx and growth like that, is that the biggest missing piece that people don't get about building a successful consumer subscription product?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:28:31):\nYeah, user retention is gold for consumer subscription companies. If you don't retain your users, then a lot of the onus is on getting them to pay on day one, that's super hard. Then you're dealing with totally different business models where you're paying for users, you're trying to aggressively upsell them before they hit any habitual usage patterns with your product.\n\n(00:28:53):\nA lot of apps naturally do that because that's how they break the mold and get their first users to do it, but I don't know, I've been fortunate to join companies after that initial phase, but especially take Duolingo and Chess.com, these are organic word of mouth driven businesses and in both ways, they grew the market from a much smaller market and as opposed to it being a very competitive space where you're competing and taking market share from others and bidding for higher terms and stuff like that. So I don't know, there's something to that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:26):\nSo what I'm hearing here is you need to find a way to grow through word of mouth for this to have any chance of success and also retention needs to be very high. Do you have a heuristic of what retention needs to be for you to have a chance building a successful consumer subscription business?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:29:42):\nI think consumer companies tend to track essentially two main types of user retention. There's more of the new user, one, D1, D7, et cetera. I think when you have your D one retention somewhere around the 30 or 40% mark, that's quite solid I think for a consumer app. If it's much lower than that, then sometimes I might question the intent of the user or the ability for that, you to I guess acquire just mathematically acquire enough users such that you can grow a big enough daily active user base.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:14):\nThat's surprisingly low.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:30:16):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:17):\nSo it feels achievable in theory.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:30:18):\nIt's achievable. It's achievable in theory, but there are so many options out there in the market and people are feeling a lot of app and product bloat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:26):\nAnd so just to be clear, you're saying 20 to 30% of people come back the next day?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:30:30):\nYeah, 30 to 40.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:30):\n30 to 40.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:30:32):\n40%. I think you're an okay place. I think even more importantly, and you mentioned Jorge to kick this off, but he wrote that very, very popular article about the",

I think you're an okay place. I think even more importantly, and you mentioned Jorge to kick this off, but he wrote that very, very popular article about the growth model and how current user retention rate was the biggest thing for them. And I think especially if you have a product that has daily frequency, that's actually the retention that matters the most is that of your existing user base that has developed a habitual pattern, how sticky is your product? And it's that retention rate that really compounds and builds that daily habit.\n\n(00:31:04):\nSo over time, especially when companies mature a little bit, you actually focus most of your energy on the existing user retention mechanics. You find that that's a much, much bigger lever. One exception is that Grammarly was a different type of product and that you install it and you don't proactively open it every day. So that was interesting to me because I assumed that you should always just focus on existing user retention, but for a product like Grammarly, it's actually the activation installation aha moment that's really, really critical and will carry the user for a very, very long time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:37):\nThat makes sense. Yeah, the stats would show someone's a daily active user because they're typing things and that's not an accurate step for Grammarly. The other interesting trend I've noticed across successful consumer subscription products is they always start very scrappy and very cost-efficient and spend efficient because I think it's because it takes them a long time to find something that's working and they're surviving on that margin of retention to growth cost essentially.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:31:37):\nYeah, that's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:06):\nYeah, and the retention piece, that's such a good point. My newsletter is very much along these lines. It's just like how many people are joining every day, how many people are leaving? And it's a difficult treadmill to be on because people, they want to save money, they want to spend on Netflix and things like that. So as amazing as you are, people are always going to leave. So the trick is how do you find more people coming than going?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:32:26):\nYeah, and I think just to take Chess.com example, I think probably 80% of our daily or weekly active users, I'll check the numbers, but something like that would be a current user or an existing user and then a new and a reactivated or resurrected user. Those are actually about similar size for a company of our sale. So even though there's a lot of attention on that new user experience, it's actually pretty interesting that the components of your active user base are actually not heavily weighed in the new user set after you mature to a certain degree.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:00):\nCan you explain that a little bit more?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:33:01):\nYes. So after some period of time, you stack up a lot of inactive users in your product and you also stack up sporadic users, people that may not have a daily habit, but they will use it once or twice a week or once or twice a month type of thing. And so eventually that math adds up where you have, let's say hundreds of millions of dormant users that are coming back and it's actually worth spending some time making sure that that resurrected, for lack of a better word, experience inside the product is really excellent and that you find novel ways to try to bring them back.\n\n(00:33:38):\nDuolingo as an example, they did a good job of using social notifications. And so if people would use contact sync or something, you might get a push notification that one of your best friends just started using Duolingo and that might encourage you to come back and resurrect into the product. And whether you resurrected in the product, it might be the case that your proficiency of the language you were learning, you were learning French three years ago, but now you for forgot most of it. And so when you open the app again, it encourages you to essentially replace yourself, do another placement test and put you in the right spot. And so some of these types of mechanics for a more mature company can lead to pretty good ROI guess is what I'm trying to say.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:19):\nGot it. Essentially, so many people have already tried in the past that to grow, you need to resurrect people that have been there. And so thinking through, it's almost like a user experience for resurrected users.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:34:34):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:35):\nOkay. Let's zoom out a little bit. You've worked at three of the most successful consumer subscription products in the world. What is the difference between how these three operate? I think there's many ways to be successful. It feels like these companies are very different. What's the gist of each of these, how they operate?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:34:53):\nWell, first of all, there's obviously a lot of similarities, but I'll just focus my answer on the differences. So I think Duolingo, what struck me most working there is they're very particular, they have an approach of product development that is infused across everyone in the company. And they actually wrote a playbook about this. It's called the Green Machine if you look it up. That was one of my most successful tweets ever really.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00",

And they actually wrote a playbook about this. It's called the Green Machine if you look it up. That was one of my most successful tweets ever really.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:15):\nI just tweeted something about Duolingo just released their playbook and I screenshotted the owl's butt and screened like a page and it was like 5,000 likes.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:35:26):\nThat's hilarious.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:26):\nYeah. So yeah, keep going. Sorry.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:35:29):\nBut yeah, the ethos of the company. They hire a lot of intelligent, energetic people out of college basically, and they give them a lot of amazing experimentation, tooling, and they care a lot about the clock speed of the company. So it's a lot of creativity, a lot of ideation.\n\n(00:35:46):\nThe product experience of dual legal actually changes multiple times per day for each user, which is pretty shocking. And so I'd never worked in a place like that before, but it really struck me about how consistently the company operated and they had specs and processes for doing each of those steps in their product development cycle and they were really, really tight about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:08):\nOkay, so that's still lingo.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:36:09):\nYeah, that's still lingo. Grammarly. This is an interesting company because they started as a paid product oriented at students. Then they expanded into more of a freemium model tailored to everyone gradually focusing more on the professional base. And then as they accumulate a lot more professionals, they realize, \"Hey, there's patterns.\" We're seeing that a bunch of marketing teams or a bunch of sales teams or a bunch of customer support teams or whatever, particular functions within particular companies were really adopting Grammarly at scale.\n\n(00:36:41):\nAnd so they were able to then layer on much more of a managed enterprisey motion. And while I was there, I was focused on the consumer self-serve motion, but they weren't siloed. They were intermixed with each other. And so a big part of my job was not just to grow the self-serve revenue and self-serve active users, but it was also how do you uncover the right teams, the right functions, the right companies for demand gen and sales to go reach out to?\n\n(00:37:12):\nSo that was a very interesting, it's a product-led sales work, and it's really fascinating thing for me to learn. And then on top of that, with all the transformation going on with generative AI, and even recently with them acquiring CODA and Superhuman and becoming more of a productivity suite, the company is just evolving pretty rapidly. It's a really exciting thing for me to be a part of and to see from the sidelines, but that just made it at its core of a different growth job than Duolingo for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:40):\nEssentially a B2B business versus a very consumer business?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:37:43):\nYeah, and a lot more meaningful strategic decisions as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:44):\nMm-hmm.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:37:47):\nAnd then the core product team also, I'm used to in growth, laying out the entire user journey that a user go through acquisition, activation, engagement, so on and so forth. And typically, growth teams, if they're well-resourced, they can do enough to move each one of these various levers. And it's just a matter of the sequencing of them and what you want to prioritize first. But Grammarly was unique in that the core product experience itself was what drove repeated activity.\n\n(00:38:18):\nIt's that I previously mentioned that current user retention thing, what most drives that is the frequency and the quality of the suggestions that you get every day. And so it was an interesting learning in that I staffed up a growth team, tried to work on this metric, and then I realized actually I'm just getting in the way. This is really a thing that the core product team most influences. Let me have a conversation with the core product leader and then shift that over to them. So yeah, just a super interesting experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:45):\nAnd then Chess.com.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:38:47):\nThe thing that's most unique about chess.com is that they're super fanatical about chess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:54):\nMakes sense.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:38:55):\nCrazy. You shouldn't be surprised. Obviously the name of the company is like this, but they've always hired people from around the world. The company's always been globally remote. They just hire people that love chess. They play all day, they watch the streams. Our Slack is always blowing up with people's chess moves and games and whatnot. I think I want to say this a little bit delicately, like Duolingo, even though the product they're providing is around language learning, I think the original ethos of how to start the company was really around motivation.\n\n(00:39:29):\nThe hardest thing to its habits, it's how do you build that daily habit? And I actually in many ways see language learning as their first vehicle. And what they have a superpower in is that, again,",

And I actually in many ways see language learning as their first vehicle. And what they have a superpower in is that, again, the motivation, the habits, et cetera. So that's Duolingo, and Grammarly actually similarly. People know them for the spelling and grammar corrections, but what's really unique about them is they're integrated across tons and tons and tons of applications.\n\n(00:39:55):\nThere's not many products that work like that, that's really unique. And so now if you hear Shishir, their new CEO talk about the AI super highway and all that type of stuff, they can now use that technology to provide a lot more than just grammar writing. And so my point is just that Chess is about chess 100%. It's in the ethos. People are crazy passionate. That just means we're always dogfooding the product. There's just an amazing energy in the company to just use the product all the time, come up with ideas, and I love that environment. I think that's fun for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:28):\nThat is so cool. What I love about what you're saying is there's no right or wrong answer. All of these companies are killing it. I think Duolingo is worth like $10 billion, something like that, and keeps growing. I'll look it up in a second. And Grammarly is worth a ton, and then Chess.com is doing super well. So I think that's a really interesting takeaway here is you can succeed in a lot of different ways.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:40:51):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:52):\nWhat's really cool about Duolingo, I was just thinking as you were talking, is yeah, it's just interesting that this very structured, methodical way of building is working so well because you could listen to that and be like, \"Oh, I don't want to work.\" This is rigid way. But the fact that it is killing, it tells us this actually works really well. If you find something that works, lead into it.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:41:11):\nYeah, that's right. Yeah, the structure is rigid, but the ideas are the farthest away from rigid as possible. You have seen their, I don't know, Superbowl commercials, they're memes, gamification, tactics. It's a super fun creative environment. So rigid is the farthest possible word to use, but what I just mean is they're consistent. They have for everything, and their product reviews are 10 or 15 minutes. It's just people go in and out. So it's just this kind of a surreal environment about how rapidly and consistently they work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:42):\nAwesome. They're worth $12 billion, and they were much higher actually, not too long ago. They're coming down a little bit. So speaking of Duolingo, when people think Duolingo, they think of the brand and the owl and the success they had on TikTok and things like that. I'm curious to get your take on as a very growth-oriented person watching that work and your take on growth, experimentation data versus marketing, viral TikTok videos, mascots, things like that.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:42:09):\nYeah, I used to think it was versus, but now I realize that they combine really well. It could be rocket fuel for your growth. Yeah, being a product person. I joined a lot of these companies literally on the home screen on my phone, and I like using them. And I consider myself someone that's not easily swayed by ads or TV commercials telling me what to buy.\n\n(00:42:28):\nSo I always had an element of skepticism on the marketing side for much of my career. But then, yeah, you join a place like Duolingo and you see how Duo the owl has developed a personality through the push notifications and the product experience, and then seeing the marketing team leverage that personality in their TikTok and in their YouTube and all throughout social media and just feed into those memes. And then we would track back in the product experience, how did you hear about us?\n\n(00:42:58):\nAnd put all those channels in there. And some days, it would be like, holy, it's bringing in 20, 30% of our new users and any given day. So those two things really go hand in hand, and that feeling has only been reinforced by Chess.com over the last five years. The first 15-ish years of this company was really under the radar. 800 million people play chess around the world, but most of that is over the board.\n\n(00:43:25):\nUntil recently, there wasn't actually that much online, but five years ago, everything changed. You had the pandemic, you had Queen's Gambit, you had a lot of YouTube and Twitch streamers, you had a bunch of kids playing it in school, et cetera. And so it's really the combination of those two things that make it take off. And it's like the growth experimentation is more the slow and steady or fast and steady, I should say, approach where you're just continually iterating, you're making the product experience better, but then every so often, there's a big wave that comes in. You can quadruple your registrations overnight and you'd be a fool not to take advantage of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:03):\nI was actually",

I was at a coffee shop this weekend. There's a family, a dad and mom and a daughter ordering, and the dad's sitting at the table and he's just on his phone, just opened up Chess.com secretly and just plain while he is waiting. Oh man.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:44:18):\nI will not admit or deny that I've done that before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:22):\nBut if I can think of anything more wholesome, I can't.

This episode is brought to you by Miro. Every day, new headlines are scaring us about all the ways that AI is coming for our jobs, creating a lot of anxiety and fear, but a recent survey for Miro tells a different story. 76% of people believe that AI can benefit their role, but over 50% of people struggle to know when to use it. Enter Miro's Innovation Workspace, an intelligent platform that brings people and AI together in a shared space to get great work done.\n\n(00:45:08):\nMiro has been empowering teams to transform bold ideas into the next big thing for over a decade. Today, they're at the forefront of bringing products to market even faster by unleashing the combined power of AI and human potential. Just of this podcast often share Miro templates. I use it all the time to brainstorm ideas with my team. Teams especially can work with Miro AI to turn to unstructured data, like sticky notes or screenshots into usable diagrams, product briefs, data tables, and prototypes in minutes.\n\n(00:45:37):\nYou don't have to be an AI master or to toggle yet another tool. The work you're already doing in Miro's canvas is the prompt. Help your teams get great work done with Miro. Check it out at miro.com/lenny, that's M-I-R-O.com/lenny. Okay, you talked about AI a little bit here and there.\n\n(00:45:55):\nI want to follow that thread. As a growth person, imagine AI informs chess.com in a lot of ways, so there's kind of two buckets here. How is AI changing the product, say chess and other places you've worked? And then how is AI impacting your work as a growth person? So pick one or both buckets and share there.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:46:13):\nYeah, I'll tackle them in sequence. I'll start with the chess one just because I have maybe a slightly unique take on that one. So chess and AI, they've been intertwined for almost a century. Some of the early computing pioneers, they just figured, \"Yeah, chess is an interesting game. We can test machine intelligence and write some algorithms or not.\" And then fast-forward to 1997, and you had IBM, they had their DeepBlue application who actually beat the world champion back then, which was Garry Kasparov.\n\n(00:46:43):\nAnd that was a huge moment of shock and reckoning of like, \"Oh man, is AI going to take over? Humans are, we're going to have jobs and all this stuff.\" And this is 30 years ago, and thankfully we're all still here and more people are playing chess than ever. And so the game of chess and chess.com specifically have learned how to augment, I guess the human playing experience with the power of chess engines, which are definitely a powerful form of AI. It's not LLMs to be clear, but there's engines like Stockfish these days that are just dramatically better than the top grand masters in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:22):\nIs that where we're at? I remember when it beat humans and now it's just dramatically better.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:47:26):\nIt's dramatically better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:28):\nWow.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:47:28):\nYeah, I think there's a rating system that compares relative skill level and an average chess player somewhere like a thousand, maybe 1,500 on the high end, a top grandmaster like Magnus Carlsen, it's like a 2,800 and then Stockfish and similar engines are like 3,600.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:45):\nWow.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:47:45):\nAnd so to put that in comparison, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:48):\nAt least it's not 10,000 or a million. I don't even know if that's possible.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:47:51):\nNo, it's not 10,000. But it's similar to if the chess engine was playing without a major piece like a rook or something, they would still be competitive against the best players.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:59):\nAnd this is",

But it's similar to if the chess engine was playing without a major piece like a rook or something, they would still be competitive against the best players.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:59):\nAnd this is the Elo score? Is that the term?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:48:00):\nYeah, the Elo score, Elo rating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:01):\nMagnus is what you said about 2,800, and then the Stockfish is would you say 3,600?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:48:04):\nYeah, and really it's because computing power is so amazing and there's so many techniques for how to do deep evaluation on specific chess lines. They can calculate tens of millions per second. So it's not realistic for a human to compete against that. But yet, watching some of these chess engines played has opened up a lot of creativity, new strategies, new lines, new appreciation for the game. And our chess.com approach is that we can bring this technology for every user.\n\n(00:48:36):\nEven people that have never moved a piece before. I talked earlier about that game review product, that's exactly what this does. So behind the scenes, we're running chess engines to basically spit out evaluations for every move that you make. And then we translate that and make that approachable to the user using their native language and plain approachable style, and even with audio and things like that as well. And that part of it, the personality, the speech back to the user, that part is LLMs.\n\n(00:49:07):\nAnd so I guess my point is that, again, chess and AI have been intertwined forever, but for us, what's most important is that we keep the customer at the North Star of it. We're not just applying LLMs just because the new hot thing, you've got to apply the right technology for the right feature to provide value to the user. And so we try not to ever lose sight of that and let hype get us too carried away.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:31):\nIt's just really surprising. I think people would not have expected AI and cannot beat every human alive ever. And chess is at an all-time high. People want to keep playing and are playing more and more than ever played, not unexpected.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:49:46):\nInterestingly, LLMs themselves are quite bad at playing chess. They hallucinate moves, they look at patterns. They're very good at pattern recognition, but not so good at going super, super, super deep on a specific chest thing. And if you've even tried to create or look at chessboard images on ChatGPT, a lot of them have the wrong number of squares. They're not set up properly, and so I don't want to be too dismissive.\n\n(00:50:09):\nI'm sure it's going to get much stronger at reasoning. And actually, Google recently sponsored a tournament where all the top LLMs played a tournament against each other. So that was pretty fun to watch. They're improving, but chess is specifically a game that having a trained deep, deep computing engine is just going to be much, much, much more powerful than LLMs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:30):\nAnd not to go down this track too far, but AlphaZero famous for beating the Top Go player. Was that trained specifically for Go? Obviously not in LLM, but that was a Go specific model.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:50:42):\nYeah. My understanding is that the one, that documentary is incredible, by the way. I don't know if you've watched AlphaGo, it's amazing how they took something so technically deep and made it so emotional and human. But I think that's the crux of how we feel, I guess, about AIs and the products that we build, actually. But to your point, my understanding is that the way AlphaZero is primarily trained is that it just plays a bunch of games against itself. And so through the neural network, it just gets smarter every time. And because it can have that repetition times a billion or a trillion, I don't know exactly what number, but it's going to get pretty damn good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:19):\nOkay. Let's go back on track to where we were going. So this was how AI is impacting chess.com. How is AI changing just the work of a growth person?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:51:30):\nI like to describe growth as the job is to connect users to the value of your product. And in order to do that, what I like to do is think about that user journey again, and essentially, staff teams that are oriented around each element of that user journey. And those teams have specific metric goals, they have roadmaps, et cetera. And then they go run against them.\n\n(00:51:52):\nSo that's how it's structured. AI, I think can be applied to speed up some elements of that essentially experiment cycle that you get through. So one example is in product discovery. As opposed to core product, which tends to have longer timeframes, and you might do thorough user research or market research. It's more foundational, more for first principles, et cetera. Growth is a little bit less like that.\n\n(00:52:18):\nIt's like you're running a lot of experiments and the output of any given experiment is the input to your next idea. And so historically, I don't even mean historically, but just a few months",

And so historically, I don't even mean historically, but just a few months ago, we were operating in a, that's history, I suppose, but there would be a lot of manual writing of these analysis docs. You'd have to read them, you'd have to understand what insight you want to grab from them and then write another spec to translate that idea. That's still happening to some degree, but I think that's a spot where even tools like ChatGPT are super helpful.\n\n(00:52:56):\nYou can just plug in like an analysis that another person wrote and just have it summarized for you and give you advice on ideas to go try. And so that ideation, that research cycle was much, much faster. I talked a little bit about prototyping also just becoming much, much faster than before. We have not yet gotten to the point where product managers themselves are actually shipping the code into production, but it's dramatically shortened the amount of time it takes to conceive of especially a bolder idea that you might have.\n\n(00:53:27):\nAnd so when I talked earlier about explore and exploit, a lot of the explore was harder to do, but now it's a little bit easier to do. You can take a broader concept and visualize it, and when you can visualize it, send it around the team, get people to click around it, that makes a world of difference. So those are just a couple examples that come to mind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:47):\nAwesome. I want to go back to this phrase right at the beginning of this answer that you shared that I think is really helpful that you see growth as simply your job is to connect users to the value of your product.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:53:58):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:59):\nCan you speak more to that? Because I think that's such a nice way clarifying what is growth's role?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:54:03):\nYeah, it resonates deeply with me because I feel like growth sometimes gets this reputation I guess that it's just pure metrics hacking, like we're cold people that just are trying to move a particular metric up and we're going to do whatever it can to throw walls and pay walls and add friction in all these spots. And even though that could theoretically work at a micro level on a specific feature or a specific metric, I think what's most healthy for a company, and I want to work at durable companies is to think about the user holistically.\n\n(00:54:42):\nAnd when you take that framing of connecting users to the value of your product, that value can change for a user over time, and that also lines up really nicely to the journey. What someone that's not even a user yet needs to understand about the value proposition is super different than what a habitual user of three plus years might need. And so the teams working on them should think from that perspective and then from there, then ladder into specific problems to solve hypotheses, et cetera.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:15):\nFollowing that thread a little bit more, people listening to this are imagining, \"How do I get better at experimentation? How do I run more experiments? How do we do this better?\" What are two or three tips and best practices that you think people need to hear maybe are not totally aware of when they think about getting better at experimentation on our teams?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:55:36):\nI think the first thing is just start somewhere. I just read this Atlassian state of product report and it was like 40% of product teams basically don't run experimentation at all. And there may be some good reasons for it. It could be philosophical or maybe you're more B2B oriented or whatever. So I get it, but I think for a lot of, especially if you work on a consumer product that has some degree of scale, some degree of frequency with your product, you can collect enough data.\n\n(00:56:05):\nAnd also I have found I can pattern match all day long. I've worked a lot of companies, right? But I'm wrong all the time. And I think consumer behavior can be very fickle and especially when you work at a company, you become a power user naturally. So sometimes you may forget what the actual user experience is for a brand new user, and so you leave a lot of opportunities on the table if you don't even try to experiment.\n\n(00:56:27):\nSo I just encourage taking that first step, just run an A/B test, find a third-party tool or something that you can integrate quickly or even just work with your engineers to spin something up. Just get in the practice of crawl then walk then run type of thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:40):\nDo you have a favorite tool, by the way? Just to throw out? Is there a go-to tool for you?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:56:44):\nWe used Statsig at Grammarly and I saw that they recently got acquired, so that was exciting news. Duolingo and Chess.com both have an in-house experimentation approach.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:54):\nSweet.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:56:55):\nPros and cons to either. Obviously Duolingo is an experimentation machine, and so it's been a huge accelerant to have our own thing specifically tailored to",

Obviously Duolingo is an experimentation machine, and so it's been a huge accelerant to have our own thing specifically tailored to be excellent at that. But no, I typically don't encourage companies to build experimentation in-house from day one. At a certain scale it can make sense. And some of these companies, they were started 15 years ago when these tools weren't out. So it was just something they had to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:22):\nSomething that you mentioned to me at Chess.com, your goal is to run a thousand experiments a year. You said you were at 250. Talk about just that as a North Star.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:57:32):\nYeah, so part of having team members that are fanatical about Chess is that the company can get pretty far just building for themselves, building for the community, and not actually being very experimentation and data oriented. The problem with that is that you can have relatively lumpy growth. And so part of the excitement of me joining the company was to help smooth that out and bring in that experimentation mindset.\n\n(00:57:56):\nSo prior to 2023, the company practically didn't experiment at all. Last year they did about 50, this year they're on pace for about 250. And then next year we have that ambitious target of a thousand. Did I make it up? Yes, absolutely, I made it up, but it's still a target and a thing for the teams to think about and a thousand experiments by itself. If you just did that but you didn't learn, you didn't make an impact, that's kind of a waste of time.\n\n(00:58:25):\nThe whole point of setting a goal is that you can have conversations about what would need to be true to actually hit that goal, and so that leads to insights. Actually we need not just product management or engineering to be running these experiments. We can experiment with lifecycle marketing, changing copy of push notifications and emails. We can experiment with app store screenshots and keywords and stuff like that. We have all sorts of content marketing teams, et cetera. We could have engineering enable no code for specific screens.\n\n(00:58:58):\nThink about our home screen or our pricing screen where we might want to do a lot of just tests that are configurable without engineering support. We might want to just track our progress and look at it from time to time and make sure that we have the right observability around this. So anyway, that's the stuff that really matters as opposed to the hitting that goal itself. So don't tell the team, but I don't actually care that much if we actually hit a thousand, but I think if we get pretty close and we accomplish some of these things, we'll be in really good shape.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:27):\nOkay, we'll make sure none of them watch this. I think chess.com is in, this is just such a cool example of a culture shifting dramatically from zero experiments to sounds like two years later, a thousand, which is three a day. There's many teams running experiments in parallel, but that's a lot. What has helped you most shift that culture? Is it just the CEO being like, \"This is the way we're going to go.\" What have you learned about helping shift to culture from No, we're not doing experiments to a thousand experiments a year.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:59:58):\nYeah, definitely a lot of credit to the CEO and co-founders like Erik and Danny, they're amazing. It's not their intuitive way of thinking about growing companies, but their mental flexibility and encouragement to evolve and add this as a tool for the company has been awesome, and they've been on the front lines preaching product-led growth and experimentation just as much as I have.\n\n(01:00:20):\nSo I'm glad that you brought that up because I think that is critically important for me, joining a company to not be at odds with the co-founders and the existing approach of the company. I think that's absolutely, absolutely critical. I think I started this podcast with the example of the game review and the positivity and how that was shared. I think those types of things are really what motivate people. They need to see this working in practice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):\nWins.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:00:46):\nYeah, you need wins, you got to celebrate them. People feel good about the learning. It's applied across the board. Who's not going to be energized by that, I think, right? So you can't just set goals in a vacuum and create it from top, right? People have to see it working and when it works, the metrics move and you learn faster and you ship faster, and that's a great environment to be part of.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:07):\nWhat was the first experiment you guys ran? Do you remember?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:01:10):\nI don't know, before my time actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:13):\nOkay. Okay. Got it. So they're already going down this track before they brought you in?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:01:17):\nThey had run some.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:19):\nOkay, sweet. Are there any other key lessons that you think people need to know to be successful running experiments at scale?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:01",

Are there any other key lessons that you think people need to know to be successful running experiments at scale?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:01:30):\nThe system matters just as much as any given experiment, probably even more, right? I think starting with a growth model, so you have an understanding of how your company grows in the first place and which channels you're going to leverage is critical. You need to make sure that you are instrumenting your product in and out. Otherwise, you're going to run experiments and have wonky results.\n\n(01:01:53):\nI won't name which company, but I was part of a company that had an in-house experimentation tool. It's about three months into the company, we're running some experiments and we realized that user retention was actually configured backwards. So all positive results were negative results.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:09):\nGeez.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:02:10):\nSo that was kind of embarrassing and that will never happen again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:13):\nYou just go through and undo all those experiments and just drive up retention.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:02:17):\nIt's kind of weird. We're seeing people use the features a lot more. Why is user retention going negative? So I have plenty of horror stories around that type of stuff, but yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:25):\nOh my God. On the flip side of horror stories, you've shared a bunch of cool examples of experiment wins. Is there another that comes to mind of one you're really proud of or that was really trajectory changing either at Duolingo or Grammarly or Chess?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:02:38):\nSo I already shared one of Chess.com and one of Grammarly. I could talk a bit about Duolingo as well. Duolingo and you had Jackson on the podcast, right? Where you talked about the streaks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:38):\nYes, talked about the streaks.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:02:52):\nSo I also don't want to steal his thunder because I was going to think about that, but the amount of learning through commitment and putting streaks on a calendar and just getting people started as opposed to achieving some large milestone, that was huge. I think we did something interesting. We spun up a virality team and virality is this really amorphous thing to me.\n\n(01:03:16):\nI think it's really hard to generate virality in your product, but Duolingo is a product that is shared quite a bit. And so we invested actually in some time to essentially add screenshot tracking for a brief period of time in the app just so we could find out the hotspots of where users were doing screenshots. And you see this in other apps too, it's not necessarily some horrible thing, but we did this for some period of time and we were able to basically articulate and say, \"Okay, streak milestones is the obvious one.\"\n\n(01:03:46):\nReally funny challenges that you get in the Duolingo experience is also super highly shared. Advancing in the top three of a leaderboard is another thing. Anyway, so you can find these different moments where that's the case. And then we staffed those moments with illustrators and animators and created these really delightful experiences around them, and that worked amazingly well.\n\n(01:04:06):\nSo as opposed to going against I guess human intuition and trying to get them to share stuff that they otherwise wouldn't on the margins want to share, lean into it more, actually grab the moments where users are already organically screenshotting and make those much, much, much better. And you can 5X or 10X and drive a lot of growth that way too. So that's not so much an experiment, it's more a core product thing, but it just resonated with me that that was interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:33):\nWell, it connects to your explore and exploit methodology. Just find or explore where things are happening and then try to exploit in a nice positive way.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:04:41):\nYou got it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:42):\nSpeaking of that, you mentioned this with Duolingo is just very good at habit formation and motivation behavior. It feels like chess is good at this too. You've worked at both these companies. What have you learned about how to motivate people? How to create habits?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:04:57):\nAgain, Duolingo would not have started without this insight from day one. They aim to focus on motivation and build a lot of these tactics. Jorge actually had this model of gamification patterns having essentially three pillars to it. You have the core loop, you have the metagame, and then you have the profile. And so we actually thought about it that way too, where your core loop is your lesson that you go through. You do a lesson, you get some rewards, you extend your streak, and then the next day you get a push notification.\n\n(01:05:29):\nIt's the core loop of the product and making that really tight is super important because people need a habit to stick to. Then you need a metagame, which for Duolingo is the path, but it's also the leaderboard achievements. It's long-term things that you're going to strive to such that you have long",

Then you need a metagame, which for Duolingo is the path, but it's also the leaderboard achievements. It's long-term things that you're going to strive to such that you have long-term, I guess, motivation to continue doing the thing. And then the profile is also critical because you build up a profile over time.\n\n(01:05:51):\nIt's a reflection of your investment inside the product experience. And so when you nail those three things, you can end up with a long-term learning journey that can be quite successful. And then to flip over to the Chess.com side, what we see is that over 75% of our new users, they classify themselves as like, \"I'm completely new to chess.\" Or, \"I'm a beginner.\" And unfortunately, if you're new to chess and you're a beginner, you're not going to have that fun of a time playing live games, and we see this in the data. It's like less than a third of those users actually win their first game. And when you lose a game, user retention is 10% worse than when you win a game.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:29):\nThat's not so bad, but at scale, that's bad.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:06:31):\nYeah, and it could be worse. That's true. And so typically what a lot of mobile games will do is they'll just create a super simplified version of the game. It's harder for us to do at chess, and so without changing the rules of that, I think that's, I don't know, it's just very eye-opening to me when you're trying to learn something, whether that be language learning or chess or whatever, usually those first steps are fraught with a lot of self-doubt and reinforcement that you're not good at the thing. And so it pays to be very intentional to craft experiences that guide the user around that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:09):\nWell, I can't help but ask, is there anything that helped that along?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:07:12):\nYeah, so something we're experimenting right now is just like purely if you say that you're new to chess, we're going to craft a more delightful learn how to play experience as opposed to dropping into a live game, that's an example. Another is hiding your ratings for the first five times such that you're not seeing your rating plummet. So there's a lot of tips and tricks you can do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:29):\nI'm just imagining a little guide that's like, \"Here's how you win.\"\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:07:32):\nYeah, or play against a coach, play against a friend, play against a bot. There's a bunch of different avenues you could take.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:38):\nWell, what I'd love is play against someone real and here's where you should move. Just like, \"Hey, here's we're going to help you win.\"\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:07:45):\nLike a hint in real-time?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:46):\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:07:47):\nI don't want to be playing with you then.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:50):\nOkay. Let me ask you a couple more questions. One is just zooming out a little bit, what's the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building products or building teams across the many companies you've worked at?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:08:03):\nYeah, I've talked a lot about products. So maybe I'll flip to the team side for a bit. I think the standard way to hire and build a team is you fill out a JD, it's got a whole bunch of different characteristics that you're looking for. You typically will find a short list of companies that are kind of similar to yours, and then you try to hire for that, right? I think that's the typical default path that a lot of companies take.\n\n(01:08:27):\nAnd I was really struck by my experience working at some smaller startups or take Duolingo as an example, where over and over and over, I saw some of the highest performers just being people that had very high agency, had that clock speed, had that energy. Yes, they cared about the mission, but they didn't necessarily need to have deep experience on that matter. And in fact, sometimes that experience could be a crutch in certain ways, especially in this world where the grounds are shifting so fast with AI, a lot of your learned habits actually need to be intentionally discarded.\n\n(01:09:01):\nYou need to have a beginner's mind on this type of stuff. So I think this is more true than ever, looking for people that respond and move quickly and think just faster and move faster. I think the fastest speed of learning, those types of companies are the ones that I want to bet on. I think those will end up surviving and thriving.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:25):\nSo just to double click on this idea of high agency is very trending these days of just higher high agency people. To unpack that a little bit, you mentioned a few of these traits, so let's just help people see what you see. So one is clock speed, just they think fast, they move fast, they learn fast. What else? What else do you look for that helps you see that there are high agency people?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:09:49):\nYeah",

    "content": ":25):\nSo just to double click on this idea of high agency is very trending these days of just higher high agency people. To unpack that a little bit, you mentioned a few of these traits, so let's just help people see what you see. So one is clock speed, just they think fast, they move fast, they learn fast. What else? What else do you look for that helps you see that there are high agency people?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:09:49):\nYeah, a lot of it actually happens outside of the interview process interestingly. So a lot of it is the types of questions they asked, \"Have they actually tried your product and gone deep into it?\" A lot of it is, it's the references, it's the communication that they have to even set up your interview, it's the energy they bring into the conversation.\n\n(01:10:09):\nYou can actually pick up a lot of soft signals on some of these traits over time. You've got to pick up on some of these patterns. I don't know that I'm perfect at it, but I've learned to balance those things quite a bit more than I did in the past when I would just purely read from my questions and my rubric and not care about anything else.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:27):\nYeah, there's like a vibes component to it. This is also support for the work trial way of interviewing versus just a talk interview where you have them actually work with you for a week or whatever.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:10:36):\nThat's a great point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:38):\nOkay. One other question I wanted to ask you. You've worked at a bunch of different sizes of companies from startup to Grammarly, I don't know, you call it a big company, bigger company. Duolingo, I don't know how big is Duolingo?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:10:50):\nThere are about a thousand people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:50):\nOkay, cool.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:10:53):\nBut I worked at Google too to start my career.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:55):\nOh, right, okay. What have you learned about just the size of company that makes you happy? What have you learned about just helping other people that you talk to decide what size of company is good for them?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:11:05):\nI definitely believe that everyone has a company stage that they shine best at. I've personally gone through this journey of big tech to tiny, tiny, tiny startup, then landed in the middle, which I consider my own goal lock zone. I talked earlier about what actually gives me personally a lot of energy is seeing across a company's efforts, but also the company being small enough that I can get into the details, I can work with the specific teams.\n\n(01:11:33):\nI can read experiment results, I can look at the pixels. And so I find that the balance of those two things tends to fit best with medium-sized companies, but that's me, right? I think at big companies like a Google, you're dealing with immense scale, which is interesting by itself. You learn a lot of best practices from your peers. They have all the tools and functions that you would possibly want to go learn from, but they can tend to move slower and it's harder to ship things and get them out the door, which eventually drove me nuts a little bit.\n\n(01:12:06):\nOn the flip end of the spectrum, these tiny startups, they move incredibly fast, but I grew all my gray hair from those tiny startups because no one knows about your company, and so you're recruiting people one by one. You're trying to get users one by one. So yeah, you can learn fast and ship a lot of things, but if you're trying to make a big impact on the world, it can be actually pretty grueling to do so at really, really, really small startups.\n\n(01:12:29):\nNow, some of them do hyperscale and make it out, and obviously, I am not one to trash that because the path that I tried for quite a while. But for me, I really like the zone where I can contribute at scale, but also execute at a pace that's more on the daily and weekly scale as opposed to monthly and quarterly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:50):\nAnd when you say medium, what size of company is that roughly?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:12:53):\nYeah, so these companies that we've talked about in the podcast are about 500 to a thousand people. Typically, these companies who have been around let's say 10 to 20 years. They're durable, ideally profitable, have a good leadership team, but there's still a lot of dimensions to go figure out. A lot of them are in key inflection points, so they're certainly not stagnant. You need to find a place that's dynamic too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:17):\nInteresting, 10 to 20 years old, I don't know if that's a, not many people would feel like that's where I want to be. I love that you found a number of companies like that that you enjoyed working at. The last question, and this is going to be taking us to a recurring segment on the podcast that I call Failed Corner.\n\n(01:13:35):\nPeople hear all these stories of all these experiments and all these companies that worked at, they're all killing it up into the right. In reality, you've touched on this, a lot of things don't work out great. So can you share a story when something went wrong, when you failed and what that taught you?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:13:50):\nFirst of all, in",

In reality, you've touched on this, a lot of things don't work out great. So can you share a story when something went wrong, when you failed and what that taught you?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:13:50):\nFirst of all, in the growth world, you're failing all the time. So I'm not going to pick a specific growth story because those don't actually hit my ego too much. But earlier in my career I did a lot of core product work. I worked for this startup called Chariot. I don't know if you ever lived in San Francisco, but.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:05):\nYes, it was like the bus super thing.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:14:06):\nThe blue commuter shuttles, like 15-person shuttles, they would essentially drive from various neighborhoods into downtown San Francisco. It's a commuting use case across between the public bus system and an Uber and Lyft. So I was there for some time. I led product there and the core service was really loved by its users. It was reliable and fast and affordable enough, but we got pretty interested in this idea that maybe we can improve utilization, maybe we can make the service a little bit more innovative if we offer dynamic routes more similar to Uber and Lyft.\n\n(01:14:46):\nHow could the drivers are driving these fixed routes? But if they have spare time, they can go out of their way, go pick up somebody at their house or something and keep going. So we tried this, we called the chair direct, really interesting attempt, but I learned a lot of lessons there because ultimately it didn't work out. One lesson is like this was kind of a solution searching for a problem. You never just purely want to chase A, it wouldn't it be nice if we did this as opposed to this is our user and this is the problem that we're solving, this is why it's going to delight them, et cetera, that's one.\n\n(01:15:20):\nSecond is you got to consider, especially in these more marketplace type businesses, there's more than just one end user and we focus so much of our attention on the writer app without realizing, oh yeah, the drivers are carrying a lot of the brunt of this experience and our operations team is as well. And so when the drivers are confused or disgruntled, that can lead to a challenging overall experience for the product. So that's definitely another one.\n\n(01:15:50):\nAnd the third one is we did a lot of actually PR, prior to the service going out just to get the word out. And PR has its time in place, but I think doing it before you have validation that customers definitely want, the thing is quite risky and it can lead to a lot of sun cost once you get it out because you need to see it through, you want to see it succeed. So yeah, this is a decade ago, honestly, I had a great time at that company, but I still remember that vividly because it contained three or more key lessons that carried forward as I have built many products since then.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:28):\nYeah, it feels like you went to the complete other end run experiments of everything before you tell anyone about it.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:16:33):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:34):\nYeah, I remember the chariot bus showing up at the Airbnb office and people getting, I'm like, \"What the hell is this?\"\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:16:39):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:40):\nVery cool. I didn't know you worked there. Albert, we've covered so much ground everything I was hoping we'd cover. Is there anything else that you wanted to cover, anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:16:56):\nNo, this is great. I hope it was useful for your listeners. I will say over the last few days, as I was prepping for this, I was honestly a little bit anxious about do I have enough deep independent frameworks that I need to come up with? But just being authentic to my actual experience at these companies, a lot of my lessons learned have been off of the backs of other people that have tried similar things and have succeeded or failed.\n\n(01:17:21):\nAnd I think what's important is that you have that your mental sponge. You can try a bunch of different things, you can absorb them and then put them in practice right away, discard the things that don't work and evolve them for yourself and for the company's needs. And so I don't know, I think that was just a realization that I had as I was thinking through this podcast, and I think that's partly why I haven't done too much public speaking.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:45):\nI know exactly what you mean. When I left Airbnb, I was just like, and that was the first time I ever took a break in my career of 30 years of just working straight in school. I was just like, what have I actually learned? I've never just sat down and thought about, here's the thing I've learned. And that led me to writing this medium post that did really well what I learned at Airbnb, and then that basically led to what I do now. So there's a lot of power and I love that this is the excuse to make you think through what have I learned concretely that I can share.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:18:17",

So there's a lot of power and I love that this is the excuse to make you think through what have I learned concretely that I can share.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:18:17):\nThat's right. Thank you for that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:18):\nYeah, and so at the beginning of this podcast, before I started recording, I always like to ask guests, what is your goal? What do you want to get out of this conversation? And usually, it's like we're hiring. We want to make sure people know about our company or we want to get the users. And your answer is just, I just want to give back things I've learned, which I love.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:18:36):\nThat's it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:37):\nAnd you've done that. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:18:44):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:45):\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:18:51):\nYeah, so the truth of it is I have a, not just the four-year-old, but I also have a one-year-old. So most of the books that I'm reading these days are kids' books, trying to make them laugh in all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:00):\nWait, any favorite kids books? Because I have three or two year olds already.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:19:03):\nWell, you said that you started singing. There's a book called Snuggle Puppy that has a song in it that just makes my daughter crack up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:11):\nOh my God.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:19:11):\nThat is heartwarming for me. But no, a book that I recommended recently at work is Ogilvy on Advertising. Do you know this book?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:21):\nI don't know the book. I've seen these tenants of marketing or whatever.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:19:23):\nYeah, it's interesting. So it's 40 years old, but it's just packed with a bunch of different practical examples about copy and creative that work in, these are old school ads, but he took a very experimentation-oriented approach to just try a lot of things.\n\n(01:19:38):\nI think in the book, it makes a good reminder that what ultimately matters is to compel your users to some action for him as buying a product, right? It's not about just creating clever ads or sexy creatives, it's to do things that compel that action. I think that's very true for many of our product and life cycle teams. And so I shared that around as an interesting recommendation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:02):\nIs there a movie or TV show? Sorry, were you going to share another book?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:20:08):\nYeah, actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:10):\nOh yes, please.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:20:11):\nOur co-founder at Chess.com, his name's Danny Rensch, and he is quite well known in the chess circles. He's releasing a memoir called Dark Squares, and it is super fascinating. He grew up in an abusive cult and was a chess prodigy. And so it is just this unbelievable story and I'm about halfway through it, it's a reminder that sometimes the people that you work with, you don't realize how deep their pasts go, but this is something else, and I think it should be out by the time this podcast releases.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:45):\nAnd it's called Dark Squares?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:20:46):\nDark Squares.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:47):\nWhich is a reference to the chess board and also I imagine the difficult past.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:20:52):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:53):\nWow. How cool. Okay. Are there movie or TV shows you really enjoyed that you've recently watched?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:21:00):\nThese days it's football season, so I'm consumed by all the hot takes of my favorite teams that I love and the teams I love to hate as well, so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:11):\nWho's your team?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:21:13):\nThe 49ers. I have season tickets and I go all the time. We had a rough season last year, so hoping to turn around.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:20):\nOkay, very cool. Okay. Is there a product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:21:25):\nYeah, so last 20 years of my life roughly, I've moved around a lot, but I've always been within walking distance of a coffee shop. It's just like a ritual that I go and get coffee and it starts my day, right? Two years ago, I bought a house and for the first time ever in my life I'm like not buy a coffee shop, and I was so depressed about this for a little while.\n\n(01:21:45):\nSo my favorite product is the bread bowl barista, and it just starts my day off. I like",

I like making horrible latte art with it, and I think it's just a reminder. I don't know. The products that most impact me, I guess are the ones that I use all the time, and it's a daily habit-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:05):\nAnd have the most caffeine.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:22:06):\nThen the most caffeine. You got it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:08):\nAmazing. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself using in work or in life?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:22:14):\nAs I was thinking about my piano stories, I also remember that my mom used to have a quote. She just said, \"Nothing is more important than your reputation.\" And she used to say this, and I think the charitable understanding of this is that a lot of the small decisions that you make each day, how do you treat people? How do you show up? What's your character, et cetera. They can compound and they open doors for you in many surprising and amazing ways.\n\n(01:22:41):\nA lot of these companies that have actually joined have come through relatively light connections. And even just being on this podcast, I think I've seen a number of folks that I've worked with before beyond the show. And so I think doing the right thing, building a good reputation, they can carry you a long way. And the flip side of that is reputations are fragile too, right? So if you do the wrong thing, take a long time to repair that. So I don't know, it just stuck with me my entire life. I thought that was an interesting life motto.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:13):\nLast question. You work at Chess.com, how's your chess?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:23:16):\nTerrible compared to serious, serious players, but quite compared to the casual ones, yeah. My yellow rating is about 1,800 for a rabbit games.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:25):\nIt sounds really-\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:23:27):\nAnd about 1,500 for blitz. Yeah, but I play many times every day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:31):\nBlitz is like fast chess?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:23:32):\nBlitz is like faster chess, three minute games. Rapid is more like a 10-minute game, which is still pretty fast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:38):\nAnd you say you play multiple times a day? Do they make time? Is this like-\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:23:42):\nThey do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:44):\nOkay. At Patagonia, there's a famous book, the founder wrote called Let My People Go Surfing, and the rule at Patagonia is you can go surfing if the waves are great. Is that how it works at Chess.com?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:23:53):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:54):\nOkay.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:23:55):\nChess is always fun. So we play all the time and they even have chess coaches on staff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:59):\nStaff, just like you can book to do?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:24:01):\nYou can book. So I get bi-weekly lessons and it's helping me improve.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:04):\nWow. Okay. This is going to drive a lot of hiring for you guys. Saved it for the end. Albert, this was awesome. Thank you so much for doing this. Thanks so much for giving back and sharing all these stories. Two final questions, work and folks find you if they want to follow up on some of this stuff, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:24:22):\nYeah, thanks for having me. This was great. You can find me on LinkedIn or Twitter. Not a super active poster, but I read it all the time. If there's something that I said today that resonates with you and you just want to get in touch, trade notes, feel free to reach out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):\nAnd can they play with you on, can they find you on Chess.com to play?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:24:39):\nThey can.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:40):\nOkay. Do you want to share your username or you don't want that?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:24:44):\nI am happy to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:45):\nNo. Okay.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:24:45):\nI just mentioned that I'm a 49ers fan, so my username is Go9ers, so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:49):\nWow.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:24:50):\nI'm sure I'll get a lot of game requests now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:52):\nHere we go.

Before going full time on teaching, he was VP of product at Netflix and at Chegg, and has written what is almost surely the most popular Medium post on product strategy.\n\nLenny (00:21):\nIn our chat, we learned about Gibson's very popular product strategy and prioritization framework, and we go through a bunch of real life case studies from his time in Netflix to see how they apply in the real world. I love how Gibson comes up with such clear and memorable frameworks, which help demystify the vagueness that surround strategy and prioritization. We're really lucky to have Gibson share these with us, and I hope you enjoy it.\n\nLenny (00:45):\nThis episode is brought to you by Flat File. Think the last time imported a spreadsheet. Did it work the first time? Chances are it did not.

We've done a couple of fireside chats together, but we've never really dug deep into anything, and so I'm really excited for this opportunity to chat. So, welcome.\n\nGibson Biddle (03:27):\nGreat, Lenny. Thanks for having me. It's fun to virtually be in the same place at the same time. Someday we'll do that in person.\n\nLenny (03:35):\nOh man, I can't wait. For folks that aren't that familiar with you, could you just share a very brief overview of your journey through product?\n\nGibson Biddle (03:43):\nIt's hard, because I'm older than dirt, to be very brief, but I'll give my best shot. The intro was, I discovered I loved teaching early. I ran a sailing school, took a year off from college. That was my first startup. And then, the three chapters of my life. The first one was in marketing, so I actually started in the mail room at an ad agency, and then went into account services and created a service that helped name new companies and products, like if you're in the Bay Area, the Versatel, or the Versateller, it's a Bank of America name.\n\nLenny (04:10):\nI've always been so curious about that industry, but that's a discussion for another time.\n\nGibson Biddle (04:14):\nOh yeah, well, we can come around to that. But at the end of the day, it's all about packaging and positioning and branding. And so, I was curious about that. I got good at it. And then, I lived in Silicon Valley, and I wanted to go into tech, and so I decided to go back to business school, and I went back to Tuck, which is at Dartmouth. It's the only ski... it's the only business school that has its own ski area, which is why I went there. It's in Hanover, New Hampshire.\n\nLenny (04:35):\nOkay, that feels like a product market fit for Gibson.\n\nGibson Biddle (04",

It's in Hanover, New Hampshire.\n\nLenny (04:35):\nOkay, that feels like a product market fit for Gibson.\n\nGibson Biddle (04:37):\nExactly. And then, after the school, this is the tech journey, I joined Electronic Arts. Punk kid in the right place at the right time. I joined in marketing, and then I switched over to product. It was a great place to learn product. They called it Producer College. I learned a ton, and my first startup was actually a joint venture between Electronic Arts and Disney. We created what's called EA Kits at the beginning, and that became Creative Wonders, and we sold that company to Mr. Wonderful from Shark Tank. He was the CEO of the Learning Company that made Reader Rabbit software and Oregon Trails. That dates me, because most of the listeners have probably played Oregon Trails as a kid.\n\nLenny (05:13):\nDying of dysentery. That's what I remember.\n\nGibson Biddle (05:15):\nYeah, yeah. And so, the product roles I grew up into, I call it a muckety muck, but a VP of product or a chief product officer. Joined Netflix in 2005. I left out some failed startups. That's important. It's important to let folks know I had some failed startups, but you can gloss over in the brief version. Netflix 2005, and then 2010 I went back to my heart, which is teaching. Chegg was a textbook rental and homework help company. It continues to exist. We took that public sort of 2014.\n\nGibson Biddle (05:44):\nAnd then, last five years I stopped direct deposit, and I'm really back to the coda in my career. I'm back to teaching, which I really love to do. So I do talks, workshops all over the world. I do more writing, which really saves my voice, and then experiment with different ways to really try to be helpful to product leaders around the world.\n\nLenny (06:02):\nAwesome. We're going to be spending time digging into some of that stuff. Did you describe this point in your career as stopping direct deposit?\n\nGibson Biddle (06:08):\nI did.\n\nLenny (06:09):\nThat's amazing. Wow. I've never heard it that way.\n\nGibson Biddle (06:14):\nAt least you understood that.\n\nLenny (06:15):\nI totally get that. Amazing. So, a question I ask folks in your line of work especially is, how many PMs would you say you've helped train, free workshops and advising and online courses, and anything else you've done?\n\nGibson Biddle (06:28):\nI thought it was going to be a, how many PMs does it take to screw in a light bulb? I thought it was going to be a joke. Yeah, yeah. Okay, my SWAG. SWAG is a stupid wild-ass guess, important idea. So, my guess is, in real life I've worked with product leaders where I was in the building with them. It would be like 500 to 1000. When I would manage an organization, there might be 200 or 300 people in it. So, that's in real life.\n\nGibson Biddle (06:53):\nThe next one would be via talks, workshops, newsletter. That's probably, I kind of can SWAG my way into that. Probably 50 to 100,000 a year. The reason I sort of know, I'm a feedback freak, so there's a Survey Monkey at the end of everything I do. So for instance, every morning I wake up, it's always feedback for the same talk. I did a Branding for Builders talk for Product School and there'll be like 10 surveys. I've got like 6,000 surveys for that. They're all watching and recording. My guess is, that means like 60,000 people have watched that one video, for instance.\n\nGibson Biddle (07:26):\nAnyways, and then lifetime, it's probably getting into 500,000 to a million. So, that's my SWAG. I could be 2X wrong on either side.\n\nLenny (07:34):\nOkay, a million, potentially.\n\nGibson Biddle (07:36):\nWell, your number's bigger. You could just go off of, what, 115,000 subscribers your newsletter?\n\nLenny (07:43):\nYeah.\n\nGibson Biddle (07:44):\nYou're getting to a billion, Lenny. You're going to get to the next level. 500 million to a billion.\n\nLenny (07:49):\nI feel like the level that you've helped PMs is at a deeper level for most of the folks, especially the courses you've done and things like that. So, it's a little hard to compare. But anyway, that's really impressive, and I feel like when I ask people this question, I feel like this is going to be a high bar to meet.\n\nLenny (08:04):\nSo, I'm excited to dig into a lot of the stuff that you've learned along this journey. Maybe the area you spend most of your time on is helping PMs build their product strategy, muscle through your workshops, and you have these legendary Medium posts about product strategy. So, I'd love to spend the majority of our time talking through just helping people build this muscle. And maybe just start, you have this really simple model",

Maybe the area you spend most of your time on is helping PMs build their product strategy, muscle through your workshops, and you have these legendary Medium posts about product strategy. So, I'd love to spend the majority of our time talking through just helping people build this muscle. And maybe just start, you have this really simple model for describing what product strategy should be for companies: to delight customers in hard to copy margin enhancing ways. So, there's kind of these three parts, customers, hard to copy, margin enhancing. I'd love to just kind of hear your take on each of these three parts, how you came up with this, and then maybe a story or two of how you relied on this and used this at Netflix.\n\nGibson Biddle (08:42):\nSure. You got the model right. And I mean, the short answer is, I definitely learned it from Reed Hastings when I started at Netflix. Actually, he did a reference check to a friend of mine, checking up on me, and the only question he asked my pal, whose name is John Daz, was, \"Hey, John, is Gib ready? Can Gib delight customers?\" That was the only question he asked in the reference check.\n\nGibson Biddle (09:05):\nLuckily, I built really delightful kids software. Back then, people were talking about satisfying customers, listening carefully, understanding them, et cetera. And the delight, it just said, no, no, no. The job is to delight customers. Like Peter Thiel, his book, From Zero to One. The job of an entrepreneur at the beginning is just to find out something that's 10X better. Delight is trying to work in that magnitude.\n\nGibson Biddle (09:28):\nThe hard to copy part, definitely I learned that. I had a product leader who worked for me, his name was HB Mock. He was focused on the non-member page. That's where people sign up for. They put in their email, their credit card, they would get a free trial. He'd looked like crap, like everything at startups sucks at the beginning, but he put a happy family on the couch on this screen, and that's where you put in your email. And that got a lot more people engaged. And so, it delighted customers, but it was helping to build the business, because more folks were setting up for a free trial.\n\nGibson Biddle (09:58):\nI'm like, that's great HB, but I'll bet my paycheck that within a week, Blockbuster's going to put a happy family on their couch, too. And this is the problem of doing things that are easy to copy. So in the long term, if you can delight customers and create hard to copy advantage, things are just a lot better.\n\nGibson Biddle (10:17):\nAnd so the last phrase, margin enhancement, that's just a fancy phrase for making money. Margin technically would mean profit. I just gave you example with that non-member page, with the happy family on the couch. It delights folks, it helps build a better business, but in that case, Blockbuster was able to copy it.\n\nGibson Biddle (10:37):\nSo, that's the model. The hardest part in that model is, how do you balance delight versus margin? So if Netflix said, hey, everybody, you're paying $20 bucks a day, but you're going to get exactly the same service tomorrow for $5 bucks a month, you'd be just like, this is fricking awesome. You'd be really delighted. But Netflix would not, the business wouldn't work.\n\nGibson Biddle (10:56):\nSo, one of the first places we sort of experiment on how to evaluate trade offs between delight and margin, in the old days, Netflix was a DVD by mail company, and if you ask customers what they wanted, then they all said the same thing. I want my new release DVDs faster, right? Back then, most customers would have to wait a week or two or four weeks. Back then, a movie came out in the theater, two months later it came out on DVD. We just couldn't afford to buy for that initial demand. So, the way it worked was, some people got it the next day in the mail, and some people had to wait two months.\n\nGibson Biddle (11:31):\nAnd so, the A/B test we set up, we said, okay, everybody says they want this, in focus groups and qualitative and surveys. Well, let's A/B test and see what we really learn. So, the AB test was called the Perfect New Release Test. Imagine we're at about a million customers circa 2005. 10,000 peeps are in a test cell. They get their new release DVD the next day in the mail. Awesome, right? And the control gets it whenever. Let's say, average maybe two weeks later.\n\nGibson Biddle (12:01):\nAnd so, the way we measure delight in this A/B test is, will you improve retention for the folks that are getting their DVD the next day in the mail? That's how we measured, it was retention. When Netflix started, it was like 10% canceled every month. 2005, it was about four and a half percent canceled every month. Today it's about 2% cancel every month. So, I'll just put it back to you. Do you think, when we looked at the AB test results... By the way, you can't get this wrong, Lenny, so just relax.\n\nLenny (12:35):\nExcellent.\n\nGibson Biddle (12:",

By the way, you can't get this wrong, Lenny, so just relax.\n\nLenny (12:35):\nExcellent.\n\nGibson Biddle (12:35):\nDo you think the Perfect New Release Experience improved retention?\n\nLenny (12:40):\nMy guess is, because you're telling this story, it's going to be a surprise, and I would guess that it did not.\n\nGibson Biddle (12:45):\nOkay, so your guess is we won't see an improvement in retention. And I'm guessing people listening to us right now, there's going to be some folks that, oh, shit, yes, that's what everybody's asking for. Of course we should deliver it to them, right? Well, in this case, both right, right? We saw a very small change in retention. That was the surprise. And so, it went from something like 4.5% canceled in the control. It was 4.45. Very small change. We can measure it.\n\nGibson Biddle (13:13):\nAnd so, now you get in the math of delight versus margin. If you push this out to all million customers, you would essentially save 5,000 customers. And so, what's the value in saving 5,000 customers? The way we valued it, we said, well we've got 5,000 customers. The lifetime value of a customer then was a hundred bucks. And then we multiplied it by two, which is our word of mouth factor. So our theory was, if you loved it, Lenny, you'd tell your friends about it, you'd rave about it, and you'd bring in one other customer for free into Netflix. And so, we used this 2X word of mouth factor. And so if you do that math, it was worth about a million bucks to us as a company.\n\nGibson Biddle (13:52):\nSo now you get into, okay, what's the cost of that additional inventory? And the answer was $5 million bucks. So on one hand, you're bringing in a million bucks of value by retaining more customers, but you're spending $5 million more, so it doesn't seem to make sense.\n\nGibson Biddle (14:06):\nOkay, so easy question. I don't overthink this one, Lenny. Would you roll this out to all customers?\n\nLenny (14:10):\nI would not.\n\nGibson Biddle (14:11):\nYou would not. Okay. Can you help build an argument for somebody who would choose to roll it out?\n\nLenny (14:17):\nOh, no. Give me the hint. I'll take it.\n\nGibson Biddle (14:18):\nThe hint was, there was an assumption in my formula. I said 5,000 customers times $100 bucks lifetime value, times a 2X word of mouth. So the argument for why somebody might do it, they disagree with the 2X word of mouth, and what the algorithm is.\n\nLenny (14:33):\nYeah, I see where this is going. Basically, the experience is so much better that word of mouth increases. It's so delightful.\n\nGibson Biddle (14:38):\nYeah. Amazon would use a 10X, right? And so, sort of a wash there. You'd probably lean forward and do it. We actually worked hard to try to isolate what that word of mouth factor was. It was really frustrating. And then, the reality was, Barry McCarthy was the CFO. He was apoplectic about the idea of using a 2X, because it means you'll invest more in building a better product. If you let the product team use 10x, Barry's like, \"We don't have the money. We don't have the money to spend $5 million on DVDs.\"\n\nGibson Biddle (15:03):\nAnyways, this is where we sort of refined our thinking about the model of delighting customers in hard to copy, margin enhancing ways. Pop quiz, I know the answer, Lenny, but want everybody else thinking about it. What makes Netflix hard to copy?\n\nLenny (15:18):\nThe licensing deals and content that they're creating.\n\nGibson Biddle (15:22):\nOriginal content, yeah. Keep going.\n\nLenny (15:24):\nTheir brand that they've built over time.\n\nGibson Biddle (15:26):\nYou trust them with their credit card every month for $20 bucks, right?\n\nLenny (15:28):\nOh, absolutely. I think I've been a customer for five years.\n\nGibson Biddle (15:31):\nYeah, yeah. What else makes them hard to copy?\n\nLenny (15:34):\nI imagine, their tech that used to be the ranking algorithm recommendation engine.\n\nGibson Biddle (15:37):\nYeah, so there's unique technology. Personalization is a great example. You just brought that up. There's only one other idea that I think is... Well, there's probably be two others for Netflix. So keep going, dig deep.\n\nLenny (15:48):\nMaybe, I don't know if this is an answer you're thinking, but just the talent they've built up over time is probably something.\n\nGibson Biddle (15:53):\nThat's really interesting. People go to culture, and then I sort of specify, what makes the Netflix product hard to copy? So, I won't allow that one.\n\nLenny (16:01",

We actually tried to experiment with friends and social, getting movie ideas from your friends. The idea is, your friends were on the network, you wouldn't want to leave. And you'd also get great movie ideas. By the way, that was a failed hypothesis.\n\nLenny (16:25):\nRight, I was just going to say, I remember that did not work out. I don't see it anywhere.\n\nGibson Biddle (16:28):\nYeah. It did not work out. Yeah, I guess we could make an argument today, every screen in the world is magically prewired so you can watch Netflix anytime, anywhere. There's sort of a kind of flywheel or network effect at work. But anyways, that's great. So, that's just a model. But I have found that model to be helpful in my thinking a bunch of times.\n\nLenny (16:44):\nThere's a couple things I wanted to follow up on there, because there's a lot there. One is this idea of testing the ideal almost, and kind of working backwards from that. That's something I always find found really helpful. Is that something that you espouse and find to be really powerful?\n\nGibson Biddle (16:58):\nHonestly, I think of these product strategies as these high level theories, these hypotheses about how you will delight customers in hard to copy, margin enhancing ways. I just gave a failed hypothesis, the social one. You actually brought up a winning hypothesis. Personalization delights customers, because it makes it easier to find movies you'll love. It's hard to copy. Netflix sort of knows the movie tastes of a billion people worldwide. That's 222 members times about five profiles per. And then the margin, this is an interesting one.\n\nGibson Biddle (17:27):\nWhen Netflix is making an investment in a TV show or movie, they kind of can guess how many people will watch it. So, they guessed that 100 million people would watch Stranger Things, so they were willing to invest $500 million. They guessed that 20 million people would watch BoJack Horseman, I'm a freak, so they're willing to make $100 million. I call that right sizing the investment, but that's how personalization helps Netflix to build margin, or to build a better business.\n\nGibson Biddle (17:54):\nAnyways, back to your original question. I mainly was just trying to find these high level theories and hypotheses that I hoped would delight in hard to copy, margin enhancing ways. The reality was, we'd have 10 ideas and probably six of them would fail, but a lot of value in the three or the four that worked.\n\nGibson Biddle (18:10):\nWhen we went to TV based systems, we actually couldn't A/B test at first, so we were going back to qual and they were looking over people's shoulders, and focus groups, et cetera. But eventually, Netflix could A/B test what's a good experience on a TV based system. They have server based systems now where they can create different experiences for different folks. So I guess my short answer was, so hard to find these product strategies that worked. There was no notion of building a perfect experience of all these things together, so we just took it one theory at a time.\n\nLenny (18:40):\nGot it. And then, on that concept of delight, I always wanted to ask you this question. I've never had a chance. For B2B, do you find this is also something companies should really prioritize and do? Because not a lot of B2B products are delightful, and a lot of them are still really successful. How do you think about that kind of framework in B2B?\n\nGibson Biddle (18:55):\nOkay, first, I think that most all of the frameworks I use work for both consumer and B2B. Personally, I've spent my whole career on consumer. The thing about consumer is, you're sort of trying to catch lightning in a bottle, right? Where enterprise, you can actually walk into it a little bit more thoughtfully. You can always find your first customers, et cetera.\n\nGibson Biddle (19:15):\nAnyways, I was thinking about what's different. For instance, one of the hard to copy advantages of B2B is switching costs, right? I didn't bring that up in the context of Netflix. It's wicked hard to cancel. It's wicked easy to cancel Netflix and restart Disney+, whatever you want to do.\n\nGibson Biddle (19:29):\nI was thinking about, I used to complain that the user interface for B2B software was horrible, and it's like, you've got to do better than this. And of course, at Netflix we proved that a simple, easy experience actually improves retention. So I would advocate, this is important, and they would explain",

It's wicked easy to cancel Netflix and restart Disney+, whatever you want to do.\n\nGibson Biddle (19:29):\nI was thinking about, I used to complain that the user interface for B2B software was horrible, and it's like, you've got to do better than this. And of course, at Netflix we proved that a simple, easy experience actually improves retention. So I would advocate, this is important, and they would explain to me all the basics. Hey, Gib. Actually, one of the basics surprised me. The people that are using our software are using it 10, 12, 14 hours a day. That's very different from a Netflix experience. And in fact, they want and need to engage in the complexity. There's stuff that they're trying to do that is really complex.\n\nGibson Biddle (20:07):\nYou can just think about our use of spreadsheets to build a cash flow statement. I'm highlighting some differences, but the model I think is still there. If you're starting a punk B2B SaaS company, I think at the end of the day, you're trying to find something that's 10X better than what's currently out there today, and then over time, your hard to copy advantage. It will be different from Netflix. It'll be different for every startup. But if you can delight your customers in these hard to copy ways, that also builds a business.\n\nGibson Biddle (20:36):\nI mean, the reason you do that, you want to feel like you don't have to compete with peeps, really. You don't like it when you're always on guard about what your competitors should do. You sort of want to get to this place where you don't really care, and your sort of true North is okay, how can we best serve our customer? And that's what I really love about that particular model.\n\nGibson Biddle (20:53):\nLenny, I would be very careful about anything I say about enterprise and B2B, because I've spent zero hours in this, okay? Now, you said half of my audience is in B2B and enterprise, and you hear a lot about the consumerization of enterprise software, and I think that's good. I think that's helpful and important.\n\nLenny (21:13):\nAwesome. That's a really helpful caveat for folks listening, that if you're building a B2B business, maybe don't follow all this advice to the letter. But I imagine there's still a lot you can pull out.\n\nGibson Biddle (21:21):\nWell, honestly, it's so idiosyncratic. It's going to be different for each company, or each startup, or different stage. And that's why the tools, the models, the frameworks I use, they have to work generally, but then people have to apply their own good judgment.\n\nLenny (21:33):\nSweet. Okay. What I'd love to do is get a little more concrete using this model, and go through a few examples of how you may have thought through problems you were tackling at Netflix through this lens, to kind of see how it actually works in practice. Does that sound good?\n\nGibson Biddle (21:48):\nThat sounds like we're going to do some rapid fire mini cases.\n\nLenny (21:50):\nThat's exactly right.\n\nGibson Biddle (21:51):\nAnd I'm going to put you in the hot seat, Lenny. You're the proxy for the listeners today.\n\nLenny (21:55):\nAll right. Just make sure they're easy questions.\n\nGibson Biddle (21:58):\nNo matter what you say, I'll make you look smart.\n\nLenny (22:01):\nI like this. I just want that applied to all of life. Okay, so the first mini case study is something that I've seen a lot of people build, kind of hack together, is this idea of watching Netflix together with friends. I think one app is called Netflix Party. So the question there is, should Netflix launch a Netflix Party feature? Basically letting people watch Netflix together but in different places?\n\nGibson Biddle (22:22):\nYeah, yeah. It's kind of a real case. A bunch of engineers at Patreon, six or seven of them, they actually enabled, if you're using Netflix, they let you connect with your friends on Netflix, watch the same TV show or movie at the same time, and chat with each other while you're watching it, trash talk each other or use emojis, what have you. They called it Netflix party. The Netflix lawyers noticed it, and so they renamed it Teleparty. It exists. You can use it across multiple games, across Disney and Netflix, whatever you want.\n\nGibson Biddle (22:52):\nOkay, so the hypothesis is, Netflix should launch this idea for real, not just download the silver light, download the...\n\nLenny (23:01):\nChrome extension?\n\nGibson Biddle (23:02):\nChrome extension. There you go.\n\nLenny (23:03):\nYeah, yeah, yeah. I think I've tried it, actually. It's pretty cool.\n\nGibson Biddle (23:06):\nYeah. It's complicated, right? I mean, you and I are both freaks, so we can figure it out. So the idea is that we'll delight customers, because this sounds like fun, especially during COVID. We can have this connected experience when we're also disconnected. Hard to copy advantage. We're kind of building a network effect. You and I will be connected and watching on Netflix. We don't want to quit because we don't want to leave each other behind. And then, the margin. For Netflix, it's largely about will it improve retention? Netflix today, 2% are canceling. Netflix has",

Hard to copy advantage. We're kind of building a network effect. You and I will be connected and watching on Netflix. We don't want to quit because we don't want to leave each other behind. And then, the margin. For Netflix, it's largely about will it improve retention? Netflix today, 2% are canceling. Netflix has just ticked away at it point by point. It's just, it's these kinds of things that create a little bit more value, that improve retention.\n\nGibson Biddle (23:45):\nThe way I think about this is, the way that addition of this feature would actually improve retention is if some reasonable number of customers actually used it. And so, what I look out for is, I don't like two percenters. So if you find an idea that only works for 2% of your customers, now you're creating complexity, one more thing to choose. What happens when I hit this button?\n\nGibson Biddle (24:10):\nAnd frankly, some complexity that everybody else building the product forgets, right? This happened to me a lot. We'd have, in the old days, there was a profiles feature. When we launched streaming, we forgot about the profiles feature for DVD. Like, oh, crap. So, as a rule, I never used rules as thumbs, but these two percenters, I would kill them. If I launched something and it was only 2% we'd, we called it scraping the barnacles, just get rid of it.\n\nGibson Biddle (24:34):\nSo, I think the key question here is, what percent of Netflix members would use Netflix Party if you launched to all? You want to guess at that, Lenny?\n\nLenny (24:44):\nLet's say 5%.\n\nGibson Biddle (24:46):\n5%. Okay. I think that's good guess. I'm going to give you some historical context. We actually did Xbox Party back in 2008, 2009. My guess with the Xbox team was it would be a two percenter. I think it barely squeaked to 5%. And then, because it was only at 5%, we killed it. So I think that's a great guess. If you had said 10 or 15%, then I would've been scratching my head. Could that actually have a shot at improving retention?\n\nGibson Biddle (25:14):\nAnyways, Netflix hasn't launched this. They could, of course, test it, but I think the history, the failed hypothesis of social, kind of leans against it, and I just gave you two examples. The friends network getting, giving ideas of friends and Netflix, and the second, the Xbox Party. Those are two failed instances of social. Netflix will keep experimenting with this, but in this case they chose not to. So, not enough delight despite the fact that it could build hard to copy advantage. And if you don't have enough delight, enough usage, there's no shot at improving margin.\n\nGibson Biddle (25:45):\nOkay. You were awesome, Lenny. I told you, you sounded exceedingly smart. Okay, what do you got? What's the next one?\n\nLenny (25:51):\nNailed it. Just real quick, I really like the reminder of just focusing on reach and making... As good as the idea might be, just always coming back to what is the reach of this thing? Even if conversion increases like 50%, if like 10 people see it, it doesn't really matter.\n\nGibson Biddle (26:05):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (26:05):\nThat's such a good reminder.\n\nGibson Biddle (26:06):\nCool.\n\nLenny (26:06):\nOkay, next one is, something that you've shared is that during COVID, Netflix auto-canceled, apparently, something like half a percent of its members because they were inactive. And so, the question there would be, why do they do that, and how would Netflix have thought about that?\n\nGibson Biddle (26:20):\nYeah. Probably seen Netflix's stock history. But the beginning of COVID, they thought they were going to have 8 million new members, Q1 2020. They picked up 16 million. So, that was awesome. It was about that time that my perception as the product manager at Netflix was looking at the data focused on non-member experience, I think his name is Eddie Woo. And he was looking at the data, and he noticed half percent of the members weren't actually enjoying the service, like for a year. They clearly had entered their credit card, their email a year ago, and then just forgot that they had the service.\n\nGibson Biddle (26:51):\nAnd so, when he thought about it, he said, you know, I feel like it's the right thing to actually auto cancel people who aren't using the service they're paying. Of course, he was doing it a time where there was great growth, okay? So, let's use the delight and hard to copy margin enhancing model. Is this a delightful thing to do?\n\nLenny (27:10):\nAbsolutely. I feel really good.\n\nGibson Biddle (27:11):\nThat's my question. Okay.\n\nLenny (27:11):\nYeah, if a company's like, hey, okay, here, take your money back. You're not using this thing.\n\nGibson Biddle (27:15):\nExactly. And what's the hard to copy advantage that you'd be building by engaging in this best practice?\n\nLenny (27:22):\nI imagine there's kind of a brand halo, just you feel good",

You're not using this thing.\n\nGibson Biddle (27:15):\nExactly. And what's the hard to copy advantage that you'd be building by engaging in this best practice?\n\nLenny (27:22):\nI imagine there's kind of a brand halo, just you feel good about Netflix being really good to you.\n\nGibson Biddle (27:27):\nTotally. So if I told you, and this is the case, Netflix chose to auto cancel these folks like, huh, that's a really cool thing to do. And then the margin, the bad news, you're going to lose a hundred million bucks. So, there is delight, there is hard to copy advantage, and you're going to lose a hundred million bucks. Does that delight and hard to copy advantage outweigh the negative of losing a hundred million?\n\nGibson Biddle (27:50):\nI'm just going to ask you two more questions. Is this a high stakes decision or a low stakes decision? Eddie's decision to auto cancel these folks and lose a hundred million bucks. High stakes or low stakes? You're the product manager, Lenny.\n\nLenny (28:04):\nIt all depends on how much a hundred million is worth to the business. I imagine Netflix is such a large scale where it's not a huge deal, and it's a one off that's not recurring, and so you could give it a shot.\n\nGibson Biddle (28:13):\nOkay, so you've skipped ahead. You're looking too smart. On magnitude, it's a hundred million against a company that's doing 30 billion in revenue. And then, the second thing you brought up is, it's reversible, which is, he could do it now, but he doesn't have to continue this practice forever. And so, my joke there, I got married 30 years ago. I was anxious about getting married. My friend said, \"Gib, if it doesn't work out you can always get divorced.\" So they're saying it's reversible. Now I've been married 30 years, so it's worked out.\n\nGibson Biddle (28:39):\nBut my point here is, as product managers, we feel like every decision we make is high stakes. It's good occasionally to think about, hey, what's the magnitude? And then, is it reversible? Amazon calls those, this was a two-way door decision. It's reversible. The one way door, those are the bigger deal. And I think frankly, most people would argue that getting married is a one way door, but hey, half of folks don't.\n\nLenny (29:01):\nYeah, very hard to reverse. Reversible but expensive.\n\nGibson Biddle (29:04):\nOkay, what else you got?\n\nLenny (29:05):\nOkay, so you touched on Netflix's recent troubles with growth. And so, something that's always come up is this idea of why don't they offer a really cheap plan, or a free plan that's advertise supported. And so, I imagine you've thought about that a lot, and Netflix has thought about that a lot. How does that work with your framework?\n\nGibson Biddle (29:21):\nWell, let's fast forward two years. Netflix earnings Q1 2022 were bad. For the first time in 10 years, they actually lost customers, and they'd like to get the growth going again. Okay, that's a different context, right? Today.\n\nLenny (29:37):\nThis episode is brought to you by PostHog. PostHog offers a suite of product analysis tools, including funnels, heat maps, session recording and experimentation, all in one easy to use platform. PostHog is open source, so you can host it on your own infrastructure, which means that you have control over who has access to your data and makes regulatory compliance a breeze, because you don't need to send user info to third parties.\n\nLenny (30:00):\nPost Hog's app system works seamlessly with your data warehouse, both for importing and exporting data, which enables you to bring your data into one place and easily understand user behavior across a range of touchpoints. If you'd like to learn more, check them out at PostHog.com/Lenny.\n\nGibson Biddle (30:18):\nSo your question is, should Netflix have a lower-priced, advertising-supported plan?\n\nLenny (30:25):\nOkay, great.\n\nGibson Biddle (30:25):\nOkay, let's do it. We'll DHM it. Would an ad-supported plan that's lower price be delightful for customers, Lenny?\n\nLenny (30:33):\nI don't know if delightful is the right word, but if I didn't have a lot of cash, it would feel really nice to be able to use Netflix.\n\nGibson Biddle (30:39):\nOkay, so the possible delight is, it might only cost you five bucks, or who knows, it might be free, I don't know. But for a set of customers who are ad tolerant, that might be a reasonable trade off, right? You don't have to pay $10 or $15 or $20 bucks. You could pay maybe five, or two? I don't really know what the right price is.\n\nGibson Biddle (30:56):\nOkay, so the next one is, would Netflix be building hard to copy advantage if they did this?\n\nLenny (31:00):\nI guess the hards of copy pieces, if there's a network effect, they just accelerate that further, and that gives them some advantage. I don't know.\n\nGibson Biddle (31:06):\nMaybe. So if they pick up a new set of",

I don't know.\n\nGibson Biddle (31:06):\nMaybe. So if they pick up a new set of people, a new set of profiles, it's a technical term, as you get big, is you build economies of scale. So if they are able to grow, Netflix, they'll spend about $18 billion on content this year, whereas poor Amazon will only spend $8 billion. I just love saying poor Amazon. Because Netflix can amortize it across 220 million members. So, more growth, more customers, and hopefully a different segment of customers that they haven't gotten yet, so it's not just cannibalistic, could build more hard copy advantage.\n\nGibson Biddle (31:39):\nMy argument, I'm just going to skip ahead, if you cross fingers, I mean, you are picking up a new customer profile, new customer type, so you're going to have incremental revenues, which is really what Netflix is looking for. For me, I just want to tell you why Netflix hasn't done advertising yet. We actually did do it, 5, 6, 7, 8... 2005 through 2008. We put big-ass ad banners on every page on the site, even for the members. We did a retention test, and it actually did not hurt retention. A big surprise. And that was the first year that we generated an operating income of $20 million bucks. It was like the first profitable year.\n\nGibson Biddle (32:14):\nWe also did this at our business. We were selling used discs, previously viewed discs. That's how we first made money, and Reed Hastings, the CEO, came to me in 2008 and said, \"Gib, I need you to kill advertising and previously viewed, because I think we can deliver a profit in our core business.\" And he wanted to keep things simple, create this simple experience that's part of a subscription.\n\nGibson Biddle (32:34):\nYou have had this. We had a lot of pride and ownership. He didn't involve me in the decision, all of these things, right? He's just sort of sticking a gun to my head. He only asked me two questions. He said, \"Gib, who's going to be the best in the world at advertising?\" And I said, \"Google.\" And then his second question is, \"Who needs to be the best in the world of personalization?\" I said, \"We do.\" And his argument was to kill previously viewed and advertising to create a simple experience for the customers, and so that we could stay manically focused on personalization.\n\nGibson Biddle (33:02):\nNow fast forward, so on the earnings call, for him, the debate is really between simplicity, which he's a huge fan of. But during the earnings call he said, \"Actually, there's something I believe in even more, and that's customer choice.\" And he was saying, you know what? I think for this new set of customers, giving them the choice to have a $5 a month plan with advertising... He did not say the $5 bucks. I'm just plugging that in. In this case, customer choice may be more important than delight. And in this case, rather, customer choice may be more important than the complexity of advertising, or maybe the stinky experience.\n\nGibson Biddle (33:39):\nWhew. There's something important. What he said is, today it's relatively straightforward to execute an advertising-based business doing this. There's a zillion partners who could do it, so we could continue to focus on the core of what we do, which is personalization. Which I thought was a really thoughtful response. So my guess is, they will do advertising, but he was very contrite. Stock had half of its value. He felt he had disappointed shareholders. So I think he was looking for ways to earn back that trust.\n\nLenny (34:05):\nYeah. The market sometimes forces you to do something you didn't expect. I really like the Socratic Method that Reed uses in the story you shared, where he kind of asks you these questions that help you get to the same conclusion he got to.\n\nGibson Biddle (34:16):\nHonestly, I reflected on that for five years. Why didn't he engage me in the decision? And then I just realized... I mean, by the way, this being a CEO is a really hard job. But I realized I had so much pride and ownership, he just knew that I wouldn't want to kill it, that it would be hard for me to be objective. And he felt strongly that he believed he knew the right answer and said, hey, I just need you to do this. And he was right. So, it took me five years to process that, but there's a lot of things you do to support the CEO, because that job is really hard.\n\nLenny (34:47):\nWe're going to talk a bit about the role of a CPO and what you learned on that journey, but one final mini case study. Should Netflix charge for customers to share their accounts with other people, outside of their home, especially?\n\nGibson Biddle (34:59):\nYeah, this one's got a lot of history. Okay, so I sort of told you a bit of the story, which is Netflix's growth has been excellent until now, and the reason they had that challenging earnings call is, it was just really hard to forecast.

Should Netflix charge for customers to share their accounts with other people, outside of their home, especially?\n\nGibson Biddle (34:59):\nYeah, this one's got a lot of history. Okay, so I sort of told you a bit of the story, which is Netflix's growth has been excellent until now, and the reason they had that challenging earnings call is, it was just really hard to forecast. They had the influx of customers at the beginning of COVID, I call them fence sitters, that just happened to join en masse. And then, are they going to leave when COVID lifts? Are they going to leave when the theaters open up again? They shut down, for 700,000 Russian members, they shut off the service. You can imagine that in Eastern and central Europe, churn was a little higher than expected. Just nasty.\n\nGibson Biddle (35:38):\nOne of the things that this cloud of COVID forecasting did, obscured how the large extent to which sharing happens. And so, what they said was, in the US and Canada, there's a hundred million customers total. They think there's about 30 million folks that are sharing their email password outside the home.\n\nGibson Biddle (35:57):\nSo, how did Netflix get here? Netflix generally, they've got three prices, $10, $15 and $20 bucks, and they're always trying to give people reason for choosing the $20 one. And so, if you looked at their, I call it the price and plan page, it looks like a gas pump. Do you want to the left one, the middle one, or the right hand one? One of the incentives that they provided for folks to choose the $20 a month was the number of multiple streams. They had gone all the way to four streams at the same time. So in my household, four people could be watching the same time.\n\nGibson Biddle (36:27):\nAnd of course people shared outside the house, right? And by the way, I don't think Netflix was clear that you couldn't. So now, if you look at the price and plan page today, they're not sort of pitching for multiple streams as the reason you should go to $20 bucks. They're pitching other things. There's better resolution. That's the key one. Better sound quality. You're going to have HDR sound and video. And then, they did clarify in the fine print that you can use one, two, or four streams for members in your household.\n\nGibson Biddle (37:00):\nAnd that was a new clarification, because it used to be kind of with a family. Kelsey and Brit are my daughters. They're in the house, of course they can use it. They go off to college, they're still my daughters, they're part of the family. Of course they can use it. Kelsey gets married. Okay, so this is the first time they clarified it.\n\nGibson Biddle (37:14):\nSo now, I come all the way back to your question. As a potential growth opportunity, they'd obviously like to clarify how this should work, and they started testing in three different countries. Peru is one, and I think in the Caribbean. These smaller countries, I'm sure they're focused with new members to figure this out first. And so, they have two different things. You could let a person outside your household, you could actually pay a little extra for them as the primary, as the sponsor, if you will. And the other is a function where a person who's sharing your account in a different household can bump up to their own membership.\n\nGibson Biddle (37:48):\nSo, this is just complicated. Can I make the DHM model work with this? Well it explains why they did it. They were giving multiple streams because it was a really delightful experience. And Netflix says it in the rules. They were very permissive. I don't really think they worried about this. Was it building hard to copy advantage? Absolutely. More taste profiles, right? And you wouldn't leave because you didn't want to cancel the service to your daughter's and using out on the east coast. And was it building margin? Actually, it was driving people up to the $20 price point, and it was improving churn. You're getting more value out of service, okay?\n\nGibson Biddle (38:21):\nSo now, what do they do? For me, this is just testing and math. Like, honestly, let's try it, Lenny. Well, think about those 30 million folks. If you get an email saying, hey, we've noticed you're enjoying the service on somebody else's nickel, would you like to upgrade to your own plan? What percent of those folks are going to say yes, right? I mean, do you have a guess on that? I don't have a guess and I don't have an answer. But this is the game, right?\n\nLenny (38:47):\nI find with emails, open rates and all these things, it ends up always being really tiny. So I guess, again, probably 5%, maybe 3%.\n\nGibson Biddle (38:54):\nOkay. I think that's a fine guess. I'll just give you a different perspective. This is kind of like a free trial, right? they've been using a free trial. And the free trial conversion at the end of a month was 90% at Netflix, right? 90% enjoyed their first month so much that they continued with the service.\n\nGibson Biddle (39:13):\nSo, I mean, I agree with you, it might be five or 10%. I was just giving you that 90% to get you to imagine, huh, maybe it could be",

I was just giving you that 90% to get you to imagine, huh, maybe it could be 10%, right? Maybe it could be 20%. This is just speculation. I think they're experimenting in these smaller countries. As we do this, if it were 10%, they'd pick up an additional 3 million in a quarter. I think that's going to help them when their growth is at a standstill.\n\nGibson Biddle (39:36):\nThe other question would be, would the primary account quit when you tell them their daughters on the east coast can no longer use the service, right?\n\nLenny (39:45):\nRight.\n\nGibson Biddle (39:46):\nI think where I'm going on this is, I don't know if we can give any real insight. The team at Netflix, this is what they live for, and the team at Netflix is testing and experimenting. They've probably put in an assumption like yours, 5% will convert, and now they're seeing if they're right or wrong, and they're figuring it in on these smaller countries, and a year or two from now, they will have worked it all out and we'll see the answer in North America. But I think it's going to take them a year or two to figure this out, because it's really hard. But they're keenly motivated, because they're trying to get the growth going again.\n\nLenny (40:17):\nI was trying to watch Super Pumped on Showtime recently, and Showtime wasn't working, and I have to call my dad, because I'm leaching off their cable login account. And turned out that they moved and they changed their cable plan, and I'm probably the reason they're keeping a lot of it.\n\nGibson Biddle (40:32):\nWell, so, Lenny, I was thinking about it. I'm open. I don't know the answer on this one, but just you and me comparing notes, what do you think? This is the kind of behavior that I love all product leaders to engage in. I call it building your personal board of directors. You're on mine, because I've been learning a lot about newsletters from you, right? Super helpful.\n\nGibson Biddle (40:51):\nBut when I would have questions like these, I would reach out to my pals, like, okay, what's the right level of investment on a mobile app versus desktop? That was a moving target for years. And I would just text my pals, and they would just give me the data. That's amazing insight, just by having peers in the business that you talk to, which this is the behavior that I want everybody out there engaged in. I call it building your personal board of directors.\n\nLenny (41:14):\nI'd love to hear a little bit more on that, actually. How do people do that? Is it pick a few people on a topic and have them as your standing board?\n\nGibson Biddle (41:21):\nI didn't even know I was doing this. This concept began for me, I was probably 30-ish. 30, yep. I got promoted to VP and I asked my CEO, \"How do I learn how to do the job well?\" And he said, \"I don't know. Reach out and build your community of peers.\" Like, oh, that was good advice. It really was.\n\nGibson Biddle (41:39):\nSo, at any moment in time... You actually had one of my board members on a podcast, Melissa Perri. She's on my board, right?\n\nLenny (41:46):\nAmazing.\n\nGibson Biddle (41:46):\nYeah, you voted for her. So, short answer is, it's really easy to build your community of peers. Just keep up your former colleagues. Keep up on LinkedIn. The harder part is building the mentors. And the first rule of thumb is, don't ask a person to be your mentor. That's really awkward. First, identify them. Say, this is a person I think that could be helpful to me. And then, find ways to be helpful. Everybody needs help. Everybody, everybody, everybody.\n\nGibson Biddle (42:13):\nSo, to help you understand the kind of help I need, my greatest fear is aging ungracefully, right? So I'm trying to understand what's going on. Okay, I asked you earlier, should I be on Discord, right? Like, oh, crap, do I have to be on Discord? But in many cases, somebody can help me to understand Discord. That's super helpful to me. And that's how those sort of mentor relationships eventually end up, and between the peers and the mentors, the mentors can help you to see around corners.\n\nGibson Biddle (42:43):\nActually, my favorite story of somebody who did approach me, they were in data, they wanted to be in product. They kept asking me, \"Hey, do you have any startups I can work with on the weekends?\" That's a good idea. I didn't have any answers. I got sort of frustrated with them. I said, \"Just build me a website, a baby website.\" He said, \"I can't build a website.\" So I gave him my credit card and said, \"Get on Squarespace.\" If you go to GibsonBiddle.com, that's my baby website that John Lou built for me. That was incredibly helpful to me. Someday I should get a real",

That was incredibly helpful to me. Someday I should get a real one, but I've decided it's not that important.\n\nLenny (43:13):\nI also have a baby website on Squarespace.\n\nGibson Biddle (43:15):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (43:16):\nWe're in good company.\n\nGibson Biddle (43:17):\nAnyways, that's the concept of a personal board of directors. It's really important and helpful career advice in the long term.\n\nLenny (43:23):\nAwesome. I'm glad we chatted about that. That wasn't something we planned to chat About. Something else I wanted to dive into, beyond strategy, is prioritization. You have a really great model for our prioritization called the JAM model, that I share often with folks. I'd love to just kind of hear your overview of this model, and when it makes sense, and just roughly how to use it.\n\nGibson Biddle (43:39):\nYeah, well, it's a lot easier because it spells something, right? As opposed to saying... I'll just give you a good case. I joined Chegg 2010. We were inventing a concept of renting textbooks to students instead of buying them, saving them a lot of money. And my first week was challenging, because on one end of the hall, the CEO, Dan, was saying, \"Grow, baby. Grow. The most important thing we can do as a startup is grow.\" And at the other end of the hall, I had my CFO partner, Greg, saying, \"Slow, slow, slow. We actually don't know if we have a business model that works.\" And I could tell he was sort of, the company's got like 40 people, sort of driving folks crazy.\n\nGibson Biddle (44:15):\nSo, as the product leader, what the heck should I do? And the answer was, I got them in a room and I said, \"Listen, I just need you to force rank these three factors for me: growth, engagement, and monetization. And I need the two of you to agree.\" So, you could say growth is most important. When we say growth, it's basically year over year customer growth. Do you want it to be 50% or 10%?\n\nGibson Biddle (44:40):\nWhatever the answer is, engagement is how I think about product quality. A more engaging product is a better product. So if you think investing in building a better product is super important, then you go with engagement, and the proxy metric that I use for that at Netflix was retention. And then, the third is monetization. You have these customers, you have this product, and how much effort do you put into turning that into a business?\n\nGibson Biddle (45:04):\nSo, Dan said, \"Well, that's easy. Growth, engagement, and monetization.\" And Greg said, \"Yeah, that's easy. Monetization, engagement and growth.\" He did the flip, right? I'm like, \"I'm going to come back in two hours. You guys got to fight this out.\" Which is sort of what happened.\n\nGibson Biddle (45:19):\nSo, they agreed on growth first, engagement second, monetization third. And then, a couple months later, it started to happen again. Greg started to say, \"No, no, no.\" And so, it was that point that Greg actually left the company. Which was, these are the kinds of fundamental misalignments that can wreck startups. I'm not saying that one or the other was right or wrong, but as leaders in the organization, we've got to get some of the basic stories straight, including how do we fundamentally prioritize growth versus engagement versus monetization?\n\nGibson Biddle (45:56):\nThis is really the number one source of misalignment that I discover among startups. And startups, you're always flipping back and forth between growth and engagement. Grow faster, build a better product. Grow fact forth, and then later, you get a little later to monetization. But this model, I find it super helpful to get leaders across an organization fundamentally more aligned.\n\nLenny (46:17):\nSo, if you're a PM, or maybe a founder, thinking about using this model, would the first step be get your leaders above you to kind of align with you on, of these three things, here's how we stack rank it?\n\nGibson Biddle (46:27):\nPersonally, I'd start with a SWAG. I would take a shot, a stupid, wild-ass guess of what I think is right, so at least I started with a point of view before I shared it with my team. And frankly, the next most important thing that happens is, if you're trying to create a metric focused organization that appreciates data and learning through numbers, deciding, I mean, the hardest one is, what is your engagement metric? How do you measure product quality?\n\nGibson Biddle (46:52):\nAt Netflix, it's monthly retention, but that's a hard conversation. The growth story's pretty, like, it's usually some percentage year over year of customer growth. I mean, but it's always different, but the only variation on what you said was, have a point of view yourself, and then get everybody's feedback.\n\nGibson Biddle (47:07):\nThat's frankly,",

I mean, but it's always different, but the only variation on what you said was, have a point of view yourself, and then get everybody's feedback.\n\nGibson Biddle (47:07):\nThat's frankly, when I would join a new company, I would give myself two weeks to develop the product strategy for that company, which is a little outrageous, but I would just do it fast. I would develop the SWAG, but then I'd go to one person. \"Hey, this is my best thinking, what do you think?\" And of course, they had been there for four years. They were much smarter than I, and they would refine my thinking.\n\nGibson Biddle (47:25):\nI'd do that one by one, and then maybe six weeks later, I could share a product strategy across the company. But this is the value of a SWAG, which is a stupid, wild-ass guess. And don't be afraid to start at that level.\n\nLenny (47:36):\nI really like that strategy, versus going in a little hole, spending months just thinking about the perfect answer, and only then presenting. I find this works better.\n\nGibson Biddle (47:44):\nWe're hiring a consulting company to do it. Go shoot me, okay?\n\nLenny (47:47):\nI like that you're hiding your mouth as you say that.\n\nGibson Biddle (47:50):\nYeah. Only Lenny can see. Yeah, but this is a podcast, Gib. Nobody can see you.\n\nLenny (47:54):\nYeah. I will reveal. Okay, so on that topic actually, I'd love to transition and talk about our last topic, which is around career, or product manager. So, you're the CPO at two very successful companies, or maybe you're called the VP of product, but roughly a head of product. You have these two muckety mucks, right? Chief Muckety Muck. And in theory, this is kind of the end state of a PM career if you stay along the path. A lot of PMs go on different paths, but in theory, this is kind of where your career is heading. What would you say it takes to become a CPO someday? What kind of skills do you think you need to build that are maybe not obvious to someone that's not in that role yet?\n\nGibson Biddle (48:28):\nYeah, let's take a little step by step. Individual contributor, and then to manager. When you're just starting, you're just trying to learn the job. And I'd say, at a high level, you're just trying to optimize for learning in your entire career. But for individuals, building products is hard, and there's a number of technical skills that are required. So yes, some technical, but a lot of creative skills. There's some consumer science, that's the A/B testing. There's the management. How do you get people working together to actually build stuff? These are technical design skills, right? These are the technical skills.\n\nGibson Biddle (48:59):\nSo, early in your career, you're just trying to learn the job. And by the way, the job is hard. And second, it's different from every company to company in different stage. So you, Lenny and I, we're just trying to be helpful in a leveraged way. But the key thing is, the job's a little different in everything. So, just try to become expert in your area, expert in whatever your one thing is that you're building.\n\nGibson Biddle (49:19):\nAnd then, the next step to become a manager is, there's a lot of, communication is sort of the heart, and that's why I try to... Product strategy is a great way to communicate what's important and what's not, try to demystify it. If you're early in your career, ask if you could be on interview teams, even if you're not hiring, because then you're starting to practice something that's really important as you want to grow your career later, which is it's really hiring and recruiting people.\n\nGibson Biddle (49:45):\nWhen I was in the thick of that, I spent one to two days a week hiring and recruiting. It's really the most important thing. And then, some amazing opportunity would come along at the company and they'd say, you know what? Maybe somebody on Gib's team should do it, right? Because they knew I could replace people. There's always somebody new to pop in. So, I really was expert in hiring and recruiting later in your career.\n\nGibson Biddle (50:07):\nIf you want to be a muckety muck, my theory is the skills of a leader are the same, whether you're head of product, or the chief financial officer, or head of data. When I'm interviewing any of those kinds of candidates, I am looking for leadership skills. Can they do inspired communication of a vision? I do look for product strategy skills. That helps you to frame what that vision is. I do look for management skills. Have they built and managed teams?\n\nGibson Biddle (50:38):\nI look for people who are proactive, results oriented. For me, leaders lead. You can't be a follower. So, I look for really proactive, results oriented folks. And this is pretty nuanced, but later in career, I look for folks who understand how important culture is, because culture helps people to understand the skills and behaviors that are wanted of everyone within the building, and they let you provide leadership in a highly leveraged",

I look for people who appreciate culture as a tool to help lead organizations.\n\nGibson Biddle (51:18):\nAnd then, of course, they had to grow up as a builder. They had to learn all those damn technical skills for product manager. If I abstract outside of all that, honestly, the thing that I probably did best, I think maybe I did three things best. To know me, I was an English major. I'm non-technical, and I didn't care. First I was in marketing, and then I went into product, which I just loved.\n\nGibson Biddle (51:37):\nI think I did a good job with sort of optimizing for learning. Actually, one of my hacks was, I started doing talks. I used to call it Topic This and That, on Friday mornings, about something I had just learned. That was the easiest way for me to learn something. So, optimized for learning.\n\nGibson Biddle (51:50):\nWe talked about building a personal board of directors, and that has been incredibly helpful for me, and that probably gets to the third thing. I was a pretty good picker, and the reason I was a good picker of companies is, I would lean on my personal board of directors. Some of them were CFOs. I'm like, \"Hey, Barry, I'm thinking about joining this startup, Chegg.\" Hey, as a CFO, as a VC, would you invest in it, right? It's the same question I have to ask, should I invest my time?\n\nGibson Biddle (52:16):\nSo, I had people like that who helped me to isolate, was Electronic Arts a good company to join in 1991? Yes. Was Netflix a good company join in 2005? Yes. Was Chegg a good company to join in 2010? Yes. So, I was fundamentally a good picker, and I would really give a lot of credit to that personal board of directors that I had for that.\n\nLenny (52:36):\nWhat about just day to day as a PM, what have you found to be really good habits, and kind of like a routine that PMs follow, that you've seen to kind of contribute to the success of an ICPM, especially?\n\nGibson Biddle (52:49):\nMy short answer is, begin your day with intent, okay? What are the three to five things I'm hoping to do today? Second, minimize meetings, okay? Minimize meetings. That sucks the life out of everybody, including you.\n\nGibson Biddle (53:03):\nSpend a lot of time with your customers. It could be focus groups, it could be usability, it could be looking at survey data, it could be digging the dirt to understand their behavior to the data, and it could be designing and executing A/B test results. Those are all ways of becoming the voice of your customer, and that's a big part of your job as a product leader.\n\nGibson Biddle (53:24):\nFind a balance between doing and thinking. Most of us do, do, do. Occasionally stop and ask yourself, okay, what's important here? What should I really be doing right now, as opposed to the things that I enjoy doing? Self-managing yourself. The only reason people need managers is that we need someone to force us to do the things that are important that we don't enjoy doing. So, I'm always self-managing myself. Gib, you have to do an invoice. Crap, I've got to bill people. That's no fun, right?\n\nLenny (53:56):\nThat inside voice, inside Gib.\n\nGibson Biddle (53:57):\nYeah, that invoice voice. Yeah, our in-voice. Gib, you should write a damn book.\n\nLenny (54:02):\nOr not.\n\nGibson Biddle (54:02):\nWe're ignoring that inside voice. Yeah, you and me both. And then, I don't know, for me, exercise is awesome for me. It keeps me happy. And don't watch too much TV, and I watch too much TV. So, there you go. And don't do what I do. Do what I say.\n\nLenny (54:17):\nRight. Yeah. I also probably watch too much TV. Funny coming from someone that helped build Netflix, but I totally get it. So, too good. It's too good.\n\nGibson Biddle (54:25):\nWell, my wife's trying to cure cancer. She's like, \"Oh, congratulations, Gib. You helped invent binge watching, you idiot. What good are you doing for humanity?\"\n\nLenny (54:34):\nOh, man. Brings us delight, and that's valuable.\n\nGibson Biddle (54:37):\nYeah, yeah. Thank you very much.\n\nLenny (54:39):\nFinal question. You've had this illustrious career. What's one piece of advice that you'd give a PM in the beginning stages of their career, and then maybe as a bonus, I want maybe mid stage. What comes to mind?\n\nGibson Biddle (54:50):\nYeah, I think I did the early stuff. Pick the right company. At some point, understand that you are responsible for your career",

And that's one of the reasons I encourage people to start building that personal board of directors, so you can compare notes. The other thing I say is, don't listen to your parents, because they're a generation ahead. They really don't know what the future looks like. I mean, I know I would give bad advice to my daughter, and so don't listen to your parents.\n\nGibson Biddle (55:16):\nAnd then later, ever since I stopped direct deposit, I think of myself as just purely career hacking. So in your career, it's just a lot like building a product. You have theories and hypotheses, you find ways to experiment with them, and then you were successful or you failed. So one of my hypothesis, whenever it was, six years ago, was I would enjoy teaching. I actually tried it. I taught at Stanford, entrepreneurship for graduate level engineers, and I really liked it, but I didn't love it, largely because I was required to be in Palo Alto every fall. I couldn't travel as much as I like to, right?\n\nGibson Biddle (55:52):\nOkay, so on one hand, okay, don't teach in the classroom, and my next vector was, what if I teach outside the classroom? That's what I really love to do. I do talks, workshops, all around the world in the last two years, virtually. I just love doing that, and I have a ton of flexibility. So, that's just a little example of me treating my career like, what's my hypothesis? Finding where to experiment with, and then, based on the results, do the next thing. And I've really been doing that my entire career,\n\nGibson Biddle (56:16):\nSo, if you embrace this idea of experimentation, you're like a product, you need to have hypothesis, you need to try see what works. The next thing you need to do in building a product or building your career is be bold. So, don't wimp out. At some point, when I'm working with different companies, they all kind of get attracted to the small, incremental wins, and they sort of forgot what made them a successful startup in the beginning, which is taking on fundamental risk. And so, I just nicely encourage people to be bold, to go a little bit out of your comfort zone, because that's where you learn more, and that comes back to this idea of optimizing for learning.\n\nGibson Biddle (56:52):\nAnyways, and how do you encourage people to be bold? How do you encourage them to try new things? And the simple thing is, just start. Try it tomorrow. For me, the baby step was when I, on talks, I would just ask my friends if I could drop by and do a talk. I just did it. I didn't overthink it. I didn't spend 97 years setting up my display and getting the right clicker. I just gave a really bad talk. But that's how I started, and then I sort of optimized from there.\n\nLenny (57:21):\nWhat a perfect way to end our chat. Really inspiring and helpful advice that I'm going to try to re-listen to and use myself. Just to close, where can folks find you, reach out to you, and then also just, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nGibson Biddle (57:33):\nThat's a great question. Thank you. The first, I would say that Lenny has been a mentor for me in \"Ask Gib\" Product Newsletter. So, I reached out to him via a Twitter and asked him lots of stupid early questions, so he was incredibly helpful. So, probably the most important thing is to know that I write a newsletter every two weeks. That's the cadence I'm on now. Lenny knew me at the beginning when I was doing dailies. He's like, \"Dude, don't burn out.\" It's called Ask Gib. I've answered like 63 questions so far. I really have enjoyed it.\n\nGibson Biddle (58:04):\nSecond thing would be my baby website GibsonBiddle.com. I have the advantage of being the only Gibson Biddle on the internet. I'm sure you're the only Lenny, but nobody can spell your last name, right?\n\nGibson Biddle (58:15):\nYeah, and then the third, how can people be useful? I'm a feedback freak, so you'll notice at the end of every talk I do, every essay, whether you find me on Medium, or Ask Gib, wherever, there's a link to give me feedback. And it's always the same question: On a scale of zero to 10, where zero sucks, 10 is excellent, how likely would you be to recommend this to a friend?\n\nGibson Biddle (58:38):\nThat has been incredibly helpful to me, and that's how I've learned to slowly get better at everything I do. The insight I get each day from folks is amazing. And I'll ask one follow up: but what'd you like, and what could be better? And it's just been incredibly helpful. So, don't ignore that link at the end. Don't treat it like United Airlines asking how is your flight? This is important, damn it! And your feedback is incredibly helpful to me, so thank you.\n\nLenny (59:04",

You can swipe left or swipe right.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:05):\nYou're known for at Twitter someone that turned the culture of the product team and Twitter in general from a very stagnant, nothing-is-changing product to shipping all the time.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:00:15):\nWe wanted to change the lack of ambition, the lack of creativity, the lack of customers feeling that the product had changed at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):\nHere's a list of stuff that your team shipped while you were there, Super Follows, Communities, newsletters, topics, Fleets, testing reactions, edge-to-edge photos, Twitter Blue, Spaces, and obviously, live video.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:00:31):\nThe sacred cows are like their own roadmap. What are all the things that you think we're not allowed to change? Let's start there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):\nThis was all relatively quickly.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:00:39):\nI was like, \"I might flame out completely, but Hell if I don't try.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:46):\nToday, my guest is Kayvon Beykpour. Kayvon was the beloved and longest-tenured head of product at Twitter and also GM of the consumer business at Twitter up until the day that it was sold to Elon Musk. He landed at Twitter through an acquisition of his company, Periscope, which was the world's largest live-streaming platform, which ended up inspiring Instagram Live, TikTok Live, Facebook Live, and basically every other social network getting into live video. He sold the company to Twitter in 2015, continued leading Periscope for a number of years, and then moved into leading product and then the entire consumer business.\n\n(00:01:19):\nIn our wide-ranging conversation, Kayvon shares what it was like getting Elon up to speed at Twitter, what it was like to be fired from Twitter, which actually happened during his pat leave. He also shares all kinds of lessons and stories from transforming Twitter's internal culture from a risk-averse, stagnant, product org to one that was shipping major features regularly. We talk about how they used acquihires and up-and-coming hungry product leaders to lead new initiatives and break through many of their sacred cows.\n\n(00:01:47):\nWe also get into jobs-to-be-done, Elon's layoffs of most of Twitter's staff after the acquisition, his lessons from building and shutting down Periscope, and also building consumer products in general, and so much more. This episode is full of stories and lessons and a bunch of stuff that you haven't heard anywhere else. With that, I bring you Kayvon Beykpour after a short word from our sponsors.

Great to meet you finally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:38):\nIt's amazing to meet you. I think this is going to be quite a unique and interesting podcast. A big thank you to Scott Belsky, illustrious former podcast guest for introducing us. When he introduced us, the one thing that he told me is that \"Hopefully, Kayvon will share the story about our time getting Elon up to speed at Twitter.\" I would love to hear that story. I bet other people would too. Are you able to share that story?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:05:03):\nWhen all the drama went down with Twitter and Elon ended up buying the company and after the eight months saga of legal back and forth ended up actually taking control of the company, there was that first two-day period where it was complete chaos at Twitter with the sink and Elon spreading his tentacles trying to find out who are the people that he wants to keep and what are the projects that are interesting. In the midst of all that, Scott ended up getting contacted and being asked, \"Who should Elon talk to?\" Scott recommended that Elon chat with me.\n\n(00:05:42):\nSo, the first time I ever met Elon was over at FaceTime where Elon was just very curious to ask, \"Hey, you were at Twitter for a while. You seem to have done some things. What should I be digging into, and who I be talking to?\" At the end of that conversation, we ended up arranging an in-person meeting where Scott and I went to Twitter HQ to actually meet Elon. I think this was day two of Elon having brought the sink in. So, we had this really bizarre, wild, but really fun experience of walking into Twitter HQ, and in my case, walking back to Twitter HQ for the first time after having been fired, which was a very strange experience for me, and we walked into the building.\n\n(00:06:29):\nI was scurried through the back door because I didn't want to make a scene and make it ... There was a lot of rumors around is Kayvon coming back, and I just wanted to avoid all of that. So, it was just a very weird experience of being scurried through the elevator and through the back door and go to this massive conference room, which we had on the second floor of the 110th building.\n\n(00:06:53):\nIn that massive conference room, it was me, Scott, Elon, and then at the very, very end of the room, Walter Isaacson, who by the way, I had a hard time. I knew I recognized. I'd never met Walter in person, but I was like, \"Is that Walter Isaacson?\" But he said nothing the entire time, and we had probably a two-hour conversation talking about the past, the future of Twitter, the good, the bad, the ugly. At the very end of the conversation, Walter came up and introduced himself and was like, \"Hi, I'm Walter. Can I get your information just in case I need to ask any follow-up questions?\" And I was like, \"Oh, shit. I guess that whole conversation was on the record. I don't know.\"\n\n(00:07:31):\nSo, it was a very surreal experience for a bunch of reasons, including just being weird for me since I was very conflicted about coming back to Twitter, even physically in the office. But I must say it was really fun. It was fun talking to someone. Obviously Elon, I'd never met him before, and he's one of the most successful entrepreneurs of our time. So, that was exciting to go into that meeting. Also, I had been spending so much time dreaming about Twitter and trying to mold Twitter in a direction that I thought was compelling and working with a team of people to do that, and to meet someone who also had a similar ambition, but obviously, in different ways ... He had his own dream for Twitter ... but it was really bizarre and unique and surreal seeing that glimmer in someone else who was like, \"Yeah, I also just bought this thing, so I can actually do whatever the Hell I want. And by the way, here's some crazy dreams I have for doing it.\"\n\n(00:08:35):\nIt was just a really ... As someone who had had their own dreams for the product, witnessing that it was really unusual and cool. I think that's probably what Scott meant when he said, \"You should ask Kayvon about that,\" was that I think we both kind of recognized that something's about to happen here. Obviously, you have this very public spectacle of someone essentially having a takeover of a public company, but all of that stuff aside, also, you could tell Elon was scheming and cooking up, \"What am I going to do with this?\" It was cool to see that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:12):\nThat's an amazing story. I love the Walter Isaacson component of it. Do you feel like you made a dent on his approach and way of thinking? Obviously, he made a lot of big radical changes. Do you feel like you made a dent in his view of where Twitter should go?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:09:26):\nI don't know. I certainly don't think I've made any impression on how he should run the company. I think that's Elon's going to Elon in his way, and I think he certainly has had some radical moves in terms of how he's running the company, the",

We didn't even talk about that stuff.\n\n(00:09:49):\nI think what we spent time talking about is I shared my perspective with him of people I thought who were exceptional, who were at the company, and if I was in his shoes, who I would spend time with and embrace. Most of the people that I mentioned are still there, which is awesome, and they seem to be A, empowered, which is great, and B, having fun, which is awesome. So, hopefully, that stuff is useful.\n\n(00:10:16):\nWe spent a bunch of time brainstorming products, and I had my set of projects that I was very passionate about because we'd given birth to them. I think a bunch of those projects, it seems like Twitter's still investing in and putting a lot of energy behind like Community Notes, which at the time was called Birdwatch. But I always felt really bullish on that being the future of essentially how content is moderated on Twitter, just because it was very clear that the way we were handling content moderation among many other flaws just wasn't scalable.\n\n(00:10:55):\nSpaces and Communities and the Creator Program of helping people make money on the platform, those are projects that we started over the year-ish prior to Elon taking over. My hope, having left the company and having had a new leader come in, was that those things would be given more oxygen. It's been awesome to see that those have been continuing to grow and be molded in different directions. Yeah, I think in that sense, I hope that our brainstorm was useful, but for all I know he doesn't even remember the conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:31):\nI freaking love Community Notes. It's such an amazing product. Let me ask two more dramatic-oriented Elon Twitter questions just to get these out of the way. The first is you said you were fired. I don't know if you've shared that publicly. People always wondered, I think, what happened. I know you tweeted during your pat leave, \"I'm leaving Twitter,\" and no one really knows the story as far as I know. What actually went on there?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:11:53):\nIt was weird, to say the least. Honestly, it took me some time to come to peace with it because it was frustrating and surprising. I guess the story of what happened starts with Jack resigning. Jack resigned in ... It was like November of 2021 at the end of the year. The board chose Parag to be the CEO of the company, and I've had a long relationship with Parag. I respect him, but I had mixed feelings about that.\n\n(00:12:23):\nTo his credit, Parag very quickly addressed one of the biggest things that I was really frustrated about in the last three years essentially of my time at Twitter. One of my biggest points of feedback and points of consternation was the structure of the company in that we had a functional organizational model, meaning we had a head of consumer product, me, we had a head of revenue product, Bruce, we had a head of engineering, we had a head of design, we had head research. It was a functionally run organization.\n\n(00:12:52):\nAnd the combination of that model and the type of leader that Jack was wasn't working in my view. I think if you're going to have a functional organization, you need to have a GM or a CEO who's extremely leaned-in to tiebreak and resolve conflict and make sure the team is moving quickly. And Jack, for all of his amazing qualities, just wasn't operating that way, and so you had a group of highly opinionated people that often disagreed and would create either the need for consensus or deadlock. That just was driving a lot of people crazy, including me, and I think it really held us back from living up to Twitter's potential.\n\n(00:13:29):\nAnyway, all of that was super frustrating for me, and the combination of that and a dramatic change in leadership with Jack leaving and Parag coming in, I wasn't feeling too stoked. Parag to his credit, when he became CEO, quickly changed that and shifted the company to be a GM structure. And he promoted me to being the GM of consumers. So, for the prior three-ish years, having been responsible for growing Twitter's consumer product, I was only responsible for the product management team. I didn't have engineering or design, and that honestly was difficult. It's very difficult to change culture with one hand tied behind your back.\n\n(00:14:10):\nStill no regrets. Had a lot of fun. I think we had some impact, but it was frustrating. So, Parag changed that. The irony of this, by the way, is he was one of the biggest proponents of the functional structure. When he became a CEO, he changed the structure, promoted me to be the GM of consumer, and I was, at that point, one month ... This is one month before I went on pat leave because my daughter was due.\n\n(00:14:35):\nSo, I went into my paternity leave being like, \"All right, I'm going to give this a shot.",

We'll see how this goes,\" as Parag addressed the biggest frustration that I had with the company and how it was being run. So, I had some trepidations but went into my pat leave feeling optimistic. Mind you, this was all before Elon was even part of the picture. He had not become a board member. There was no news about him having beef with the executive team or for that matter, trying to buy the company.\n\n(00:15:06):\nSo, I went on pat leave maybe a week and a half before our daughter's due date. Three weeks goes by. In that three weeks, Elon joins the board, leaves the board, makes an offer, has a short dramatic feud about whether that goes through. And also during that time, my daughter was born. Some drama at the hospital for us, but a week afterwards, we come home. Mom's healthy. Daughter's healthy.\n\n(00:15:35):\nThe day after we get home from the hospital, Parag called me and said that he was letting me go and that he was taking the team in a different direction. That night, Twitter signed a term sheet with Elon to sell the company. So, a lot happened in a very short period of time, and the reason that Parag gave is exactly what I shared publicly, which was that he wanted to take the team in a different direction. The only other thing he said is that given that new direction, he thinks that the things that I'm good at, Twitter doesn't need anymore. And the things that Twitter needs are not particularly in my skill set or in my interest.\n\n(00:16:14):\nHe wasn't particularly expressive about what that direction was, but that was the reason he gave me. That was a huge bummer for me for a bunch of reasons. One, I love the company. I love the product, and also it just sucks to leave not on your own terms. And two, I was just confused. The timing was very frustrating and confusing for me, not least of which because I had just come home from the hospital while on paternity leave. But also because at that time, especially the fact that Elon was buying the company was ...\n\n(00:16:48):\nWell, I was conflicted, honestly. I was very excited because Elon is someone that I looked up to immensely, and you just look at the things that he's achieved in the world and you can't help but be inspired by that. And two, Twitter for all of, I think, the impact and progress that we had made, had a lot of challenges associated with its governance and the fact that it was constantly vulnerable as a public company. So, there's just always this drama associated with Twitter as a public company, even a private company before that, that made it extremely hard as a builder to get shit done and have the product live up to its potential.\n\n(00:17:27):\nOne of the benefits of this particular takeover was that Elon offered a path towards solving all of that. It was like, \"Oh, cool, now you've got one owner who happens to be, by the way, extremely opinionated about the product and a voracious consumer and creator of the product.\" I think there was an incredible opportunity in that that now you have this organization and this product and this incredible ecosystem that can be devoid of all the political bullshit associated with being a public company. Now, it has this conduit to just living up to its potential.\n\n(00:17:59):\nSo, it was a bummer to be removed from that, I suppose, without having any agency myself. That was very a long-winded answer to your question, but that's what happened towards the end there. Like I said at the beginning, it took me a while to come to terms with it and to be at peace with it. I did eventually. Listen, there's a huge silver lining of I spent the first year of my daughter's life with her and my family. My wife Sarah had left Twitter eight months prior to me leaving, and so when's the next time we could all be together and have time and space to just enjoy each other and our new family, and frankly, to avoid a lot of the drama that ended up ensuing that not a lot of people could have predicted? The deal was on. The deal was off. It is just a whole lot of drama that I got to miss, which is the silver lining.\n\n(00:18:53):\nThen it was confusing there for a bit because when Elon did end up buying the company, in that conversation that I had with him, it was definitely ... I was conflicted about do I want to maybe spend some time working on this still? Elon was very cool about ... He actually used this phrase at the end of our conversation, which I still find hilarious. He was just like, \"Do you want to just come? You seem like you care about the product, and you don't have dumb ideas. Do you want to come hang out?\" And I was like, \"What would my job be?\" And he was like, \"Don't know, just hang out, and you can swipe left or swipe right.\" He used the swipe right, swipe left Tinder metaphor, and I thought that was hilarious coming from him.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:38):\nFor ideas that come up just like,",

He's like, \"We don't have to make this a thing. Just do you want to hang out and work on the product with us?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:40):\nThat's so funny.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:19:51):\nSo, I ended up deciding that actually, I'm just ready. I'm ready to move on. I spent enough time at this company, at this product trying to shape it into something that I was passionate about. I think it's someone else's turn, and especially Elon. If you buy it's your turn. You can do whatever you want with it.\n\n(00:20:13):\nSo, that was conflicting for a bit, but I would say towards the end of the year, it was pretty clear in my mind that I was ready to move on and start thinking about other problems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:23):\nWhat I think about is there's always this tension being a PM at a company with a very strong-minded, product-oriented founder, and I feel like you would've been in the epitome worst possible situation there, where you're a product leader between Elon and the rest of org. So, I think it probably would not have worked out.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:20:40):\nI'm not sure I would've been able to articulate it as succinctly as you did just now, but I think that is the feeling that I had that it's not my place anymore. I don't have a canvas to try and exert my dreams on this place. I think Elon took that mantle, and I'm excited to see what he going to do with it is the feeling I had.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:07):\nYeah. You've touched on this. You're known for at Twitter someone that turned the culture of the product team and Twitter in general from a very stagnant, nothing-is-changing product to shipping all the time, all kinds of stuff. So, here's a list of stuff that I've gathered your team shipped while you were there. Twitter Blue, which is I think called Premium now, Spaces, Super Follows, Communities, newsletters, topics, fleets, being able to see Instagram photos in line, testing reactions, edge-to-edge photos, tons of UX improvements, and obviously, live video. What did you learn about how to change a product culture from a company that's very risk-averse and essentially just not shipping a lot to taking big, bold bets and becoming a lot more open to new stuff?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:21:53):\nTrying to drive culture change is both one of the most challenging things and rewarding things. For the first year of my role ... There was a chapter of my time at Twitter, maybe just to backup, that was just leading Periscope. In that first chapter of maybe two years, I was not really involved with Twitter stuff all that much. That started to change when we really tried integrating Periscope with Twitter, but chapter two of my time at Twitter was when I became the head of product. That first year of being the head of product was one of the most difficult of my career not because the work was difficult, but because it was so politically and bureaucratically exhausting to try and change culture in a way that just there wasn't alignment around.\n\n(00:22:40):\nIt comes back to the point I was making earlier around the organization of the company was functional, and so it is one thing for me to have some ideas and a plan and a strategy that I felt compelling. But when you have to essentially drive consensus amongst your peers across the other functions, that's a different game. That's not execution. That's politics and consensus building. I both can't stand that stuff, but I think ... This is going to sound like I'm tooting my own horn, but good enough at it and I have enough patience at it that I invested the time and the energy. I think a less patient person wouldn't have bothered and would've thrown their hands up.\n\n(00:23:25):\nI think honestly, a lot of it just comes down to I had practice. At my first company that I started in college with one of my best friends, Joe, who I ended up co-founding Periscope with, we got acquired by a big, public, ad tech company called Blackboard, and we were 19 at the time. We got thrown into a public ... I was a senior executive at a public company that was not your quintessential tech company. It was even more difficult to get things done. So, through the four years I spent there, I learned a lot about how to navigate that type of environment.\n\n(00:23:56):\nIt all came coming back when I was given the product role at Twitter. That first year of changing culture was like-\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:24:00):\n... product role at Twitter. That first year of changing culture was like walking through mud, and it was really difficult. But I think when we started building that alignment and building excitement that like, oh, actually maybe we should be taking some bigger swings, and when we started seeing through the execution against some",

That first year of changing culture was like walking through mud, and it was really difficult. But I think when we started building that alignment and building excitement that like, oh, actually maybe we should be taking some bigger swings, and when we started seeing through the execution against some of those plans, I think it ended up, it got easier and easier. It becomes addicting. I think people end up feeling like, oh wow, maybe these sacred cows we had didn't need to be so sacred.\n\n(00:24:37):\nAnd so I think after that first year, it became a lot more fun. It was still difficult, but it felt like we were all swimming in the same direction a lot more. But I think my takeaway there is you can't change culture without having alignment from the top. It's difficult to change culture when you have a pocket of a company trying to advocate for change.\n\n(00:25:01):\nSo I think we got there in the end. We didn't move as much urgency as I think we drove. We were not fast enough, we were not bold enough. I was consistently dissatisfied with what I was achieving and what our team was achieving. But I think we did make a change. Twitter was an organization that had a lot of sacred cows and became very [inaudible 00:25:24] in its ways. Literally the first two years I was at the company, the stated product strategy for Twitter was refine the core. It was like, we're not making any big bets here, team. Our goal is to keep turning the knobs that are working.\n\n(00:25:42):\nAnd listen, as much as I was kind of throwing stones from the sidelines through that period when I was in Periscope land in our separate office a few blocks away from the mothership, that focus actually did help the company for some period. The reason why Twitter went from stagnant to declining DAU growth to growing DAU again is because they refined the core. This is when they went from the reverse chronological timeline to the ranked timeline, and the year after that was a lot of knob turning. It was like, how do we make these recommendations better? How do we make our push notifications more relevant?\n\n(00:26:16):\nNow, that is not an inspiring product strategy. That does not result in the product feeling materially different or adding new capabilities, but it did return the company to user growth. And I think that the fact that it did actually calcified the organization's reticence to take any risky bets even more. So it was a very interesting predicament because when I got into the role, the goal wasn't to change that progress. We wanted to continue reaping the benefits of refining the things about the product that were working really well. What we wanted to change was a lack of ambition, the lack of creativity, the lack of customers feeling that the product was changed at all.\n\n(00:26:58):\nBecause you would hear people, I mean, one of the beautiful things about working on Twitter as a product is that you have literally customers being injected into your veins. Every single day, whatever you change about a product or whatever you don't change, they're telling you what they love and what they hate. And it is both exhausting and exhilarating. It is one of the most ridiculous luxuries of product development, is working on a product that many people use and therefore you get that much feedback around.\n\n(00:27:25):\nAnd it was a very common thing for us to hear people say, \"What are you all doing over there? The product hasn't changed in eight years.\" And that was horrible to hear, and I felt it too, as a critic on the sidelines, as a user who wasn't an employee who eventually became an employee, I had the same feedback. And so that was my mission. I was like, I am somehow ridiculously in this fortunate position that I've been entrusted some responsibility here. I might flame out completely, but hell if I don't try. And so that was both fun and exhausting, like I said.\n\n(00:28:00):\nBut it was as simple as starting with we are voracious users of the product ourselves, and if we aren't, by the way, that's its own problem. I think that in order to build something wonderful, you have to be a customer of the product. And sure, I'm sure you could point to businesses and products where that's not the case, and I'm sure there's a flaw in that philosophy somewhere, but I've always believed that one of the best ways to build products is to be a customer yourself and to find your own pain points and to build a product that you want to use. And so that's actually not that hard to do if you're a user of Twitter and you can think critically. It was ripe with opportunity. And so it was actually really fun and amazing to be able to craft a plan that started to take a swing at some of these things.\n\n(00:28:50):\nAnd the other thing I'll add to this is that there were so many sacred cows at Twitter that the sacred cows are their own roadmap. It's like a built-in free roadmap of like, all right, what are all the things that you think we're not allowed to change? Let's start there. Everything from moving from reverse chron to a ranked feed, that was a sacred cow. Text and 140 characters, that's a sacred cow. Not letting anyone control any tweets that they see on the platform. The notion of Lenny owning his reply space was anathema at Twitter.\n\n(00:29:21):\nIt's just like if a tweet gets, if you get an at mention and you",

Text and 140 characters, that's a sacred cow. Not letting anyone control any tweets that they see on the platform. The notion of Lenny owning his reply space was anathema at Twitter.\n\n(00:29:21):\nIt's just like if a tweet gets, if you get an at mention and you don't like it or it's abusive, we're not touching that. We can't annotate tweets with [inaudible 00:29:30], all that stuff, those are all sacred cows. And the process of starting to address those one by one reveals a lot of the cultural hesitations that existed.\n\n(00:29:43):\nSo yeah, I'll never forget one of the first features, and this is such a tiny feature that we worked on after I started the role, we were building this feature called hide replies. It still exists in the product today. If someone replies to one of your tweets, in the tweet details area as a reply to one of your conversations, before you had no ability, the only way you could address unwanted content was reporting it. So that was like Twitter acting as policemen and policewoman, completely unscalable and challenging, especially in the context of someone replying to one of your tweets.\n\n(00:30:18):\nAnd so we wanted to add a feature that let you hide a reply to one of your tweets, and it's not impacting what people say. It's not impacting free speech in the sense of you can still broadcast whatever you want, but if you're going to come into my reply space and say some shit that I don't want to see in my feed, I should be able to hide that. Tweet what you want, but don't at mention. You can't scream in my face basically.\n\n(00:30:40):\nAnd I remember we had a PM on our team who was leading this feature who a few weeks into this project mentioned to me that she had had a conversation with someone on the engineering team that told them, \"Don't work on this feature. This is bad for your career. This is not going to launch, and you don't want to work on this. You don't want to be seen as having worked on this.\" Because it was so kind of anathema to we can't let people hide replies to their tweets. And I just remember hearing that and my blood was boiling. That is the most, it was such an interesting representation of the culture, not just hesitation to try new things, which by the way, that product might've failed. And that's fine, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't try.\n\n(00:31:27):\nBut to go so far as to dissuade someone else who was excited about experimenting with a hypothesis to see if it could help customers on the platform and telling them, \"Don't work on this. It's bad for your career.\" As a microcosm for some of the cultural challenge we had around trying big, bold bets, which by the way, this wasn't even a big, bold bet. It was such an innocuous thing to try. But there was a lot of that and it made it very difficult without some sheer force of will and also just a lot of effort. So there was a lot of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:01):\nKayvon, there's fractals of stories that I could infinitely follow. There's so much interesting stuff here. One that just stands out is this idea of the sacred cows become your future roadmap. It's like flipping it from here's the thing that we're all afraid of. No, this is not what we should be doing. I think that's really interesting and could be a lesson to people.\n\n(00:32:20):\nThe other is just, I love this point you made about the growth was most accelerant when you're just focusing on the core, that's what actually ... Like optimize, people bash on optimizing the existing experience and just micro-optimizing, improving, versus trying to take all these big, bold bets and experiments. Obviously, that's also valuable. But I think it's really interesting that that's what reignited growth and was responsible for growth for a while.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:32:44):\nAnd continue to be, by the way. One of the lines that we had to maneuver was creating a portfolio of bets where some of them were not speculative at all. We knew that if we continue to invest in ML and getting better with recommendations in the main feed and through notifications and things like improving the onboarding flow, it was rife with opportunity.\n\n(00:33:12):\nYou'd have really dumb things happen. We would learn. There was one just bizarre and incredible meeting we had where we finally had got more rigorous around instrumenting our onboarding flow. And we found that in a couple countries, like we had a bug with our SMS verification flow where we wanted to verify users who were signing up with a phone number and our telco integration to send SMS verification cards just wasn't working. And so a huge percentage of people signing up in the UAE and other countries just couldn't use Twitter.\n\n(00:33:46):\nAnd so of course at the scale that we were operating in with hundreds of millions of users, you need to be able to refine the basic building blocks of the product, and that's going to lead to reliable growth. But we wanted to balance that with a portfolio of other bets and product improvements that would materially add new capabilities. And that was a balance that I don't think existed. And by the way, I don't think we nailed it either under my tenure, but it was the driving force of what I wanted to achieve, was to create a better balance that would result in evolving the product and introducing new capabilities. And so that's what",

So creating more excitement down the, oh wow, we can actually try new things. There's also, it felt like there's a sense of trust that you built with Jack and execs of just like, okay, we can actually trust this team.\n\n(00:34:47):\nAlso, it feels like because growth started up, there's probably a sense of like, okay, we can try some new crazy ideas. It feels like another part of your strategy was [inaudible 00:34:56] hires and bringing in these entrepreneurial folks to take the lead on some of these big ideas. Can you talk about that? Was that something you actively thought about and was that a big part of the impact there?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:35:07):\nTotally. Yeah. So I think a couple things. One, the only thing I'd add to what you said in terms of the ingredients, it was also just storytelling and just repetitive storytelling around this is the vision, these are the bets we're making. Here's why. And you can't just tell that story once. I'm talking internally, by the way. There's a whole other component of this, which is externally how do you tell, especially for a product like Twitter where it's a consumer product that hundreds of millions of people are using, and you have many constituents, you have users, you have advertisers. And so it was very important for us to tell the story of here's what we're doing and why. Here's why you should believe in us. And by the way, give us all your constructive criticism too, because we're listening and we're going to build that into ... So that storytelling was really, really important.\n\n(00:35:51):\nAnd this is oversimplifying the world, but there's two types of internal team members. There are people who hear that story, who have been a part of the organization who's been slow, or maybe they've been outside the company as a user of Twitter, and they're like, I'd never really want to work there because it doesn't seem like a particularly ambitious product company. And one of two things happens when you hear that story. Either you're inspired and you're like, yeah, we can finally take a swing at making this product better. And maybe I wasn't interested in working in this company before, but I mean, this is an iconic product, and to have an opportunity to reshape it is really exciting. Or again, oversimplified world, but there are people who are very pessimistic and maybe aren't excited by that vision. Let's just stick to what we know works. We're not going to take any big swings. That's a waste of time.\n\n(00:36:35):\nI think one of the really important things about driving cultural change at the leadership level is you've got to identify whether someone's on the wagon or off the wagon and either quickly convince them to get on the wagon or if they're not on the wagon, they shouldn't be there. And that's something that we were terrible at, and we didn't have the organizational structure to be able to enact that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:59):\nThe wagon is they're excited and bought into this vision and want this to happen?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:37:03):\nCorrect, and contribute towards it. And off the wagon is like you're not at the company. And we didn't have an organizational structure that could allow for that, nor frankly, the fortitude. I include myself in this. I feel like I've learned a lot about how to make that determination. So I think we were terrible at that. And Elon is the whatever, if that's a spectrum, Elon is the opposite spectrum of that. His tolerance for people who are not aligned and his tolerance for low performance is famously extremely low. And I think it's one of the things that when I say A/B test, it's very interesting to see the extreme to which he has operated.\n\n(00:37:37):\nAnd I think I've learned a ton around, we didn't have the organizational structure nor the fortitude to be swifter, and that made cultural change way slower. We still were able to change the culture, not as much as we should have, and certainly not as quickly as we should have or efficiently as we should have. Because by the way, a lot of high performers who are aligned with that desire to change and build, they don't have the, there's not like an equal distribution of patients. If you're extremely talented and you're dealing with organizational shit, you're going to go find someplace else that lets you do your craft and have impact. So it's very difficult.\n\n(00:38:16):\nBut anyway, going to your question, one of the things we found that was a really effective way of accelerating cultural change and also helping drive some of these product initiatives that were particularly speculative was doing small acquires. And really the benefit of that was, A, you bring in a founder type who is an entrepreneur, who drives urgency, who has ambition, who's ideally savvy enough to also work in the context of a large organization, which sometimes is a totally different skillset",

I mean, it is a totally different skillset. And a lot of our most ambitious bets that were the riskiest and most misaligned with how the product worked or there was no easy staff to build on top of, a lot of those bets were driven by founders who we basically acquired and said, \"Here, you are going to run this.\"\n\n(00:39:13):\nAnd they believed in it. They were able to rally a team around them, and it's all the attributes of a startup, but with the canvas of a product that hundreds of millions of people use and more resources. So Spaces, Communities, Community Notes, called Birdwatch back then, these were all projects driven by ... Fleets, as well. These were all projects that were run by small teams led by entrepreneurs who we acquired, like Keith Coleman runs Community Notes, last Birdwatch. He actually was my predecessor. We acquired his company so that he could be the head of product. And then when he moved on from that role, he was extremely passionate about this idea of crowdsource moderation and letting people annotate misleading content on the platform without Twitter acting as a policeman.\n\n(00:40:03):\nAnd that was a very speculative bet that by the way, a lot of people thought, most people thought was a terrible idea. We gave Keith a little silo to go build this vision, and then it was our job to make sure that bet didn't get suffocated in the context of a big organization that would otherwise have not had patience for it.\n\n(00:40:26):\nAll of the community effort or the creator efforts started with Super Follows and tipping, and all these things were led by Esther Crawford, whose company we acquired and who had her own couple of viral moments with the Elon acquisition. But she's a phenomenal leader who, again, is a perfect example of balancing that entrepreneurial startup muscle with the savviness to be able to get things done at a large organization. Fleets was run by Mo Oladam, who's an entrepreneur, and Communities has gone through a few iterations obviously and still is in the product, but John Barnett and a team of people who we acquired from Chroma Labs.\n\n(00:41:02):\nSo I think that that story of acquiring hungry, ambitious founders and giving them responsibility and latitude is a success story of Twitter's. I mean, I'm a beneficiary of such a bet as well. My company Periscope was acquired, and I was given the responsibility to eventually lead the product team. So I feel like that we ended up realizing, both through the company's history and through learning, that this is actually a very effective way to drive cultural change and to deliver impact because you need a special type of person to be able to both operate within the existing structure and change the structure, to know when to use the system and to know when to fuck the system.\n\n(00:41:52):\nAnd I feel like my whole life has benefited from other people taking bets on me like that, to the point that even I was like, \"Really? You sure you want to?\" And so I think I've enjoyed trying to pass the buck and do that for other people, and I've never regretted it. You always, taking a bet on people and especially throwing them in a deep end, which on paper they may be unqualified for, I think is one of the best ways of driving change. And by the way, supporting growth, you've learned so much more when you're thrown into the deep end than in other contexts. And so I think it's fantastic, it's an expensive strategy if you're going to go buy a bunch of companies, but it's a great strategy for the situation that we found ourselves in at Twitter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:40):\nIt feels like every big bet was one of these companies from the list that you just shared, and I'm glad you shared Periscope, obviously. That's a great example, too. I guess maybe just a follow-up question here, is there anything you learned about how to do this well? I know you talked about maybe creating a little silo for the team, because so many companies acquire and acquihire and they just go nowhere.\n\n(00:42:59):\nSo I guess just a two-part question, just like what are some tips for how to do this well at a company? And then, two, you also, we were talking offline about this previously and I think it's a really interesting point, that a lot of companies staff based on who's available versus who is right for the role, and let's wait until that person is there for us to bet on this. Can you just talk about lessons there?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:43:19):\nThat last one is a huge pet peeve of mine that I feel like we learned the hard way, and particularly it's a common pattern I think in highly functional organizations where you have different people making decisions on how to staff projects, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that. But I think in the situations, in the situation we found ourselves in where we had this sort of cultural evolution that we were going through where some people just didn't agree with the things that we were prioritizing, they were begrudgingly going along with it, but you would end up in a situation where the combination of that sort of cultural shift and strategy and the fact that the way",

It's even harder if the team doesn't believe in it. This is to the point of just being toxic. The startup would never succeed if all the people who are working on that startup aren't to the point of being perhaps irrational obsessed with that idea. And still willing to see truth, you need to be able to see whether the thing is working or not, but if you don't believe it in the first place, I'm not betting on that succeeding.\n\n(00:44:50):\nAnd so this was common, and sometimes not as extreme as the examples that I mentioned, but I think one of the lessons I learned, and it's quite intuitive actually, is you need to staff projects with the team of people that are well equipped from a skillset standpoint, but more importantly have an obsession with the idea they want to pursue. It's going to make them work harder, it's going to make them be more creative. It's going to make them have the sufficient level of ambition and desire to will this thing into existence. Because every project, whether big or small, there is an element of you need to will this thing into existence because it's hard. The only way you're going to get through that pain is by having that desire, and I think a very easy cheat code for an organization to employ is to say, if you're going to work on something, especially if it's speculative or risky, staff it with a set of people who believe in it and really want to learn whether this solves a customer problem or not. Because if you don't have that ingredient, it's going to drag everyone down and it's just not going to be as successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:55):\nThis episode is brought to you by Heap, the product analytics solution that shows you everything users do on your digital product, website, mobile product, or other digital services.

This kind of touches on something I wanted to touch on, which is jobs-to-be-done. This is maybe one of the most recurring controversies of the podcast, is jobs-to-be-done amazing or is it really bad and not something you should do? We've had many guests share their opinions. I feel like at Twitter, jobs-to-be-done was implemented so strictly that it burned a lot of people out on it. It's like, oh my, this is not anything anyone should ever do. I'm curious, just your lessons and experience of just with frameworks in general, the jobs-to-be- done specifically, maybe even OKRs.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:47:31):\nI've only seen one interview on your show that covers this. Sriram was particularly spicy when he talked about jobs-to-be-done, which is unsurprising because. I spent a lot of time talking to Sriram about jobs-to-be-done. I mean, I guess I'll just start by saying I was not a fan of how we leveraged jobs-to-be-done at Twitter. I thought it was exhausting and not particularly helpful, and so it's a particularly sore subject for me because I was sort of charged with defending it and rolling it out. It's hard to do that when you don't really believe in something. But...\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:48:00):\nIt's hard to do that when you don't really believe in something, but to me the critique is less about Jobs-to-be-Done though there are many critiques of it and more about every framework at its limit is followed to such a religious extent it's just unhelpful. You need to have nuance in how you leverage these frameworks. Otherwise, you lose the forest through the trees and you end up following a process for the sake of following a process. And that's what happened with Jobs-to-be-Done. So I think that's my real critique of it. It's not the... I mean listen, the premise of Jobs-to-be-Done and my most charitable take on Jobs-to-be-Done, which is actually useful is that it forces you to look at things through the lens of customers and understanding what their needs are and understanding what their true",

I mean listen, the premise of Jobs-to-be-Done and my most charitable take on Jobs-to-be-Done, which is actually useful is that it forces you to look at things through the lens of customers and understanding what their needs are and understanding what their true alternatives are outside of the narrow lens of your product.\n\n(00:48:47):\nAnd I think that's just healthy product thinking. You don't need a framework called Jobs-to-be-Done. You don't need to think about milkshakes in order to be able to do that. It's like you could employ common sense or you could leverage something like Jobs-to-be-Done, to be able to force your mind to think of things through that lens. So I think that's my charitable view on what Jobs-to-be-Done can help you do, but as a framework into and of itself as a sole governing principle of what to build, it's just not useful.\n\n(00:49:14):\nBy the way, in the same way as, and I think Twitter had this problem as well prior to our detour around Jobs-to-be-Done, if the only way the organization is trained to think about what to build and what not to build is OKRs, it's equally unhelpful at the limit because sure, you can have a good sense of what you should build to drive metrics, but by the way, you might be focusing on the wrong metrics or that might not help you have the right balance of things to build. That might not help you see when the things that you're building are actually hostile to customers.\n\n(00:49:47):\nSo just as an interesting example, the thing that I remember about your interview with Shriram, if I'm not mistaken, I think he mentioned, and I love Shriram, I'd be happy to debate him about this on his podcast, but he mentioned one of the examples I think was the Amazon. When you get order confirmation from Amazon, they intentionally bury the order details. You have to click the link and authenticate to go see what you ordered. I don't give two shits what metrics that drive for Amazon. That is one of the most customer hostile things I experience in my daily life. I order a lot of things from Amazon. I hate the fact that I can't search my email to see what I ordered. And so I think the problem with these frameworks is that you lose nuance and ultimately, and this is where I agree with Shriram, he actually mentioned this on your podcast as well, you need to be able to make trade-off decisions that balance what's right for the organization and what's right for the customer.\n\n(00:50:43):\nAnd sometimes based on how you devise your frameworks, your metrics aren't actually aligned with the customer's benefit. Like the Amazon example, and we had many famous examples in Twitter's history, which were the same. One of our key metrics that we always optimized Shriram growing was DAU and we had obviously the rank timeline did wonders for growing DAU and it was a great experience for many customers, but we often had features that would not lead to a good customer experience and the team would just be blind towards leaving hostile customer experiences in place because it was good for metrics and aggregate. And the famous example of this is we had this toggle, which we called Swish very affectionately, but it was like a sparkle icon.\n\n(00:51:26):\nBefore you could switch between the rank timeline and the following, that reverse chronological timeline, which is still in the product right now, it was just the toggle. You would press a button and it would turn your feed reverse chron, which very few people use as a percentage of our users. But you had power users who really cared about having a reverse chronological timeline and we took so many baby steps on the evolution of this product. The very first baby step was you press the toggle, it turns you to reverse chron and then we would pull the rug out from underneath you and make the experience go back to the rank timeline after, I don't know, 24 hours or something like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:02):\nOh, wow.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:52:03):\nAnd the reason that the team felt strongly about keeping it this way is it was better for metrics. Why? Even if Lenny wants a reverse chron feed, we knew that he would spend more time in the app if we put them in the rank timeline and this was the number of debates that we had about this because the team understandably was like, \"This is good for metrics\", but at the same time you'd have customers being like, \"I fucking hate this experience. I'm telling you I want reverse chron. Stop randomly changing it for me.\"\n\n(00:52:34):\nInstagram has I think gone through their own struggles with this as well. They tiptoed their way towards ultimately giving people control and the difficulty in making product decisions comes down ultimately to making these trade-off decisions and you have to look at things through the lens of the customer. You have to balance that with what's driving the right business outcomes. And sometimes those things are aligned and sometimes they're not, and the answer isn't any one framework. Sometimes it's just good old-fashioned judgment and product taste. And so that's where my take is different. I don't think the issue is Jobs-to-be-Done, although I'm not the biggest fan of Jobs-to-be-Done. The issue is just having the right nuance and ultimately the right leadership to be able to weigh these things and see when your frameworks are not actually helping you make the right decisions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00",

The issue is just having the right nuance and ultimately the right leadership to be able to weigh these things and see when your frameworks are not actually helping you make the right decisions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:20):\nI think that's really important advice and I love hearing the details if I actually think about this stuff. Actually finding this balance is very hard in practice. I'm curious if there's something you could recommend or have learned about how to know when you've gone too far with a framework like signs like you have implemented this to religiously and maybe you should be thinking a little more broadly.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:53:41):\nThere's two, I think, simple and obvious ones. One is if the result of your framework is that subjectively bad decisions are being made, then something's got to change. Assuming the person who's making this assessment has good product taste, which is in of itself subjective obviously, but my personal view on this would be in the role that I had, if I saw that our organization was being incentivized to make decisions that to some non-trivial degree of the time were just bad decisions that I don't like as a user, I can't stand by as a user or builder, then something's got to change. Either bad judgment was made in following the process or the process was wrong, or if that framework, it didn't even lead to the right debates, then that's how you know. Either you have an incentive problem but the team did what they were incentivized to do or that there was bad judgment and that's a different problem obviously.\n\n(00:54:38):\nBut I think in the situation we found ourselves in where the team was again understandably hyper focused on driving DAU because that was the strategy for so long. It left so little room for even taking ambitious bets that in the short term wouldn't drive DAU, like some of our bets that I still to this day believe in hurt DAU in the short term, but you had to squint and believe over time would improve some metric DAU or otherwise, like a product like Spaces. In order for Spaces to be actually used, you needed to make sure that when Lenny starts a Space that people would join. And how do you get people to join Lenny space when they're used to having an asynchronous feed of tweets? Well, you can send push notifications, you can occupy really trying real estate at the top of the app that lets people know, \"Hey, Lenny's live right now. He's in a space, there's people here, come join.\"\n\n(00:55:31):\nGuess what happens when you put a bar at the top of the app that tells people when they're live? You move tweets down, you move ads down, DAU goes down, revenue goes down. And so if you have an organization that's just hyper focused on the thing that matters is driving DAU quarter over quarter, then that doesn't leave enough room for nuance to accommodate new speculative bets that might hurt one metric, but over time have other consequences that are positive and beneficial, like enabling an entire new vector of content creation and conversation on the platform. I guess the other answer to your question in terms of how do you know when the framework's not serving you right? When you start imagining and planning for a bunch of bets that the organization then sees is disincentivized to make successful, then something's got to change.\n\n(00:56:17):\nEither your strategy is just not the right strategy because it doesn't abide by the frameworks or the framework needs to accommodate the fact that actually we're going to try some things that in the short term either might not show up as blips on our DAU radar or are going to help some other metric that's important. And so that took us some time to get, and we tried a variety of schemes to make that work. Community Notes, the project that I was mentioning Keith started, we intentionally structured that like a startup. It was literally like we made a seed bet on Keith and his team and we were like, don't worry about the OKRs. We're not going to judge you on the basis of your OKRs.\n\n(00:56:57):\nAnd there's some pros and cons to that. A lot of our projects worked that way. Fleets started that way. Community Notes started that way and some other projects started more part of the core organization because they were so intertwined with how we were the nature of the product that it just made sense to... Separating it was going to do more harm than good. So you just have to figure out based on how execution is going, whether you've got the right framework and you've got to be willing to make adjustments when it's not working.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):\nThat's actually really helpful. The two that I'm taking away here is how often are you feeling bad about the features you're shipping? Like they're bad for users and you think they're bad for you as a user potentially. And the other is it keeping you from taking big bold bets that don't necessarily drive the metrics you're focusing on. Okay, so before I let you go, I want to spend some time on Periscope. I don't know if everybody knows the history and story of Periscope. Basically it was the biggest live video streaming platform in the world and I imagine inspired basically every other social network to build a live-streaming platform, Instagram live, Facebook, TikTok, obviously Twitter. So I want to spend a little time here and see what you learned and also just broadly consumer products, but first of all, I hear there's a story",

So I want to spend a little time here and see what you learned and also just broadly consumer products, but first of all, I hear there's a story with Kobe Bryant and Periscope about him using it in some form. Can you share that story?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:58:18):\nBefore Periscope launched publicly, which it was in March of 2015, I want to say, we had a small beta that grew to maybe 500 people in total before we actually released the app publicly. And in that time while we were still in beta, I was trying to personally onboard every single user and I had a shtick that I did, which was we'd get them in the app and I would start a broadcast. We had a feature called Private Broadcasting that we basically built for this use case, which is someone joins, I'm going to go live and they're going to join and I'm going to show them how the app works. And we were spending a lot of time in our office, so Kobe, Chris Saka actually invited Kobe to the beta.\n\n(00:58:59):\nAnd so Chris connected us and I did a private broadcast and Kobe joins and I was like, it was like 10:00 PM in the office and my routine was like, let me just walk around the office talking through the mechanics of Periscope through the lens of this demo of like, \"Hey, let me show you around the office and here's how the chat works and you can tap the screen to send hearts and if you want me to do something, go to the room over there, just type it in the chat and it'll come up.\"\n\n(00:59:22):\nAnd sort of showed one of the things that was unique about Periscope was it was a one to many broadcasts, but still low latency enough that it felt like a FaceTime so you could have the bidirectional communication between multiple viewers and a broadcaster. And so I was teaching him how to use the chat and showing him the office and he was playing with it and at one point through the end of the demo he posts a comment that was like, \"Why the fuck would anyone want to watch someone else stream live?\" And I remember my heart sank and I started fumbling through like, \"Well, we think it's cool.\"\n\n(01:00:03):\nAnd before I could even get the words out, he posted like, \"I'm just fucking with you, bro. This is incredible.\" And I just remember it was just such a surreal moment that has, I'll never forget, I mean Kobe's a legend obviously, but to have him essentially troll me while also putting a point on what was cool about the experience and that was bidirectional and something he commented on to cause the broadcaster to change their behavior or change the experience, it was a really ironic full circle of showing off how the product works. But yeah, it's one of my favorite early Periscope stories.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:41):\nOh man, if I kept doing that, the manual onboarding, I'd be like, \"Who's coming?\" Just always worried that someone else fancy is going to join. You never know who Chris Saka is getting, who he's talking to. That's amazing. Okay, so it's been about 10 years, I believe, since you sold Periscope and about six years ish since you stopped running at as CEO, something like that. Now as I shared, every single platform basically is doing this. They added live video streaming. I'm curious if there's anything you learned about just competing with these major platforms.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:01:14):\nWell, there's a few reasons why Periscope failed ultimately and why we shut down the app. Obviously Periscope, the technology and the mechanics still lives on because you can go live on Twitter, you can watch live broadcasts on Twitter, you can do audio conversations on Twitter and all of that is the Periscope stack. Still there, which is awesome that the legacy lives on in a different form factor. The reason that the Periscope app failed, it really comes down to a few things. One, we did not address the core problem that retention wasn't good. Our poor retention was mapped by just an incredible surge in top-line user growth. And for Periscope, it was interesting because every month or two we would blow up in a new market that would just bring along an incredible surge in usage.\n\n(01:02:02):\nWe blew up in the US, we then blew up in France. We then blew up in Turkey. We then blew up in the Middle East and you had these incredible surges, but underneath that surge, the core product had retention issues and we ultimately just did not, we didn't spend enough time prioritizing, addressing those. And in fact, we shipped product changes that made those retention issues worse. Compounding that was the fact that one of the theses behind our acquisition, the Twitter acquisition, was that we would leverage the scale and the community and the product mechanics of Twitter to make the product grow faster and also become more durable. And I think that's connects to one of the reasons why I feel like one of my learnings and one of the things that we knew but just failed to execute on was that I still am very skeptical that there can be a consumer product that is just focused on live video, like a generalized synchronous live video application for short form video I don't think can be durable on its own.

I think you have to surround that product with enough features and capabilities to allow a community and an ecosystem of users to be able to stay in touch with one another asynchronously and synchronously. This is why a lot of the other products that you mentioned that incorporate live capabilities and we're shameless about copying. What was working about Periscope, they're surrounded by a scaffolding that lets people also stay in touch with each other. Asynchronously Instagram, it's an asynchronous product that has synchronous features like live. Same with TikTok obviously. And I think we were in this position where it was a live only product.\n\n(01:03:39):\nYou are connecting with your audience and having a great time when you're broadcasting live, but you're not using the product to keep in touch with that community when you're not broadcasting. How often throughout the day would you broadcast live from your phone? And mind you, this is different for products that are live. There are live consumer products that focus on a specific vertical like whatnot for selling or Twitch for gaming that have very different properties that make it more durable as a standalone live product. But Periscope was really in this consumer generalized live-streaming from a phone land, and I think it was just not durable to have the product be live only. And the time it took us to integrate with Twitter was way too long. And there was reasons for that that come down to just how distracted Twitter was with its own roadmap and refining the core and they just had other fish to fry basically.\n\n(01:04:32):\nAnd all of that leads us to competition because at some point Facebook woke up and decided this is cool and we need to go build this. And I obviously wasn't there on the inside, but legend has it, Mark says, \"Hey, you 300 people, stop what you're doing. Go basically make live exist in our product as a first [inaudible 01:04:56] experience.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:56):\nOh, wow. I didn't know that.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:04:57):\nAnd if you have that level of organizational effort put on building something that by the way, you don't have to spend any time wondering what the product looks like, just go copy these features basically and make them work. And they did a lot of other savvy things too from a partnership standpoint. We had a lot of prominent streamers that ranged from influencer or just creative people that became known on Periscopes, all the way up to celebrities like Kevin Hart and others who were prolific Periscopers that Facebook just went and bought out.\n\n(01:05:30):\nThey were just like, \"Cool, we're going to pay you a bunch of money to stream exclusively with us.\" So they hit us from all sides. They had the entire company put their effort towards building live in a way that was cohesive in the core product first with Facebook and then Instagram and then also attacked it from the creator as well. And we were too slow and it was very painful to think about because it was like many other insights that Twitter had early. Twitter had the right insight, but botched the follow through. I'm not pointing fingers, I blame myself for that just as much, but there's a pattern where Twitter is really great at spotting meaningful consumer behavior changes. They spotted Vine and acquired Vine, botched it, spotted Periscope, botched it, spotted Instagram by the way, before Facebook tried to buy Instagram, Twitter was trying to buy Instagram, and there are other reasons why that didn't fall through, but it's interesting to me, it's one of the interesting aspects of Twitter's history.\n\n(01:06:35):\nThey were phenomenal at spotting meaningful changes in consumer social behavior, and actually putting their money where their mouth is in terms of trying to follow through on bringing those bets in-house, but then botching the execution. And so that was one of the things that was really motivating for me when I was in my role leading product of Twitter was I didn't want to make that mistake and we didn't end as up buying anything like Vine or Periscope and keeping the product. We obviously bought lots of small acquirers, but we did obviously have a bit of a story with Clubhouse that ended up with us building Spaces and competing with them. But anyway, that was a long, rambly story. Hopefully that answered your question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:25):\nYeah, there's so many. Again, it's all these fractals of thought threads I want to follow and ask you about. Real quick on the Vine and Periscope point, I was going to ask this. Twitter, as you said, had the opportunity to win in video in so many ways. Vine was amazing, killing everyone, loved it, and then it's fades away. I guess, you already shared a lot of challenges Twitter had with executing, shipping, Secret Cows, things like that. Is there anything specific with video? Was it just like, oh, this is not actually a huge priority and we're just going to ride it for now and that's why it didn't work out? Or is there anything more that?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:07:53):\nNo, it's even more like pathetic than that 'cause I think Twitter did believe in video, but it made this classical mistake that we also unfortunately recreated",

They then competed with Vine internally. So Vine was a separate organization within Twitter, separate office obviously in New York and then Twitter rather than integrated holistically into the product and pour gasoline on it, they built a native Twitter video feature that was a different stack, different team. It became what you think of as Twitter video now. It's like the most simple active uploading video and all the professional video tools called Media Studio that let publishers like ESPN put content. All of that was basically built as a separate team, separate organization, separate product that was competing with Vine. You had two visions for short form video that were manifesting, and that's the quickest way for things to get messy.\n\n(01:08:58):\nAnd of course the separate startup team is going to get, you're not going to be able to make good on the vision of buying the company and integrating it in all the right ways if you compete with it internally. And we had a similar thing happen with Periscope. We were very focused on Periscope with separate organizations, separate structures, separate app. Periscope at the time primarily was focused on UGC live video. So user-generated content being streamed from a phone. Twitter then decided to get in the premium live video business very famously with acquiring rights to Thursday night football, the NFL. Guess what happened? We competed internally rather than have a cohesive technical and product vision for how to embrace live video across the spectrum of UGC and premium live video, Twitter put a separate team in charge of premium with a separate product, separate technology stack. And so you had two ways to manifest live video on the product. It was like UGC live video, which was awkwardly not even really implemented well with Twitter at the time. And then premium live video, which had totally different UX, total different team, totally different architecture. And by the way, the company put a tremendous amount of energy and investment in talking about Twitter being a place to watch the NFL. And meanwhile you had this burgeoning UGC ecosystem, so this was like we're making the same mistake all over again. Now, luckily in the Periscope case with a lot of persistence and impatience and table pounding, we eventually fixed that mistake, but we wasted a tremendous amount of time. It was just a lot of headbutting in politics and eventually it took us a lot of time to technically reintegrate things together and now it's clean and awesome, right?\n\n(01:10:48):\nESPN can go live with behind the scenes content at Wimbledon and it's the same technology stack and the same user experience, the powers, Lenny going live from his iPhone. But I think that was one of the reasons why it was an example of failed execution that ended up wasting time, resources and just leading to a subpar product experience that other companies I think have avoided making such mistakes. Facebook being a prime example, as frustrated, I am with them as a competitor for having really taken over the use case for live video. Got to hand it to them, brilliant execution, have a lot of respect for them. So we made sure to not make that mistake moving forward.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:33):\nI imagine there was reason for that. Partly I imagine this calcification of just like, we can't get you done, we just need to start a new team and do this thing. I imagine it always comes from like, oh, this makes sense. And then you realize, okay, this was a terrible idea down the road.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:11:47):\nYeah, it's that and also leadership. When you don't have unified leadership around these things, you end up making decisions that are in conflict with one another. They're just need a highly opinionated person at the top that avoids that kind of messiness from a.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:12:01):\nThat kind of messiness from a product and engineering standpoint.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:05):\nYou mentioned Clubhouse, so I think what's interesting is one, many people copy Periscope as a product. I don't know if you'll describe it as copying, but it feels like spaces very inspired by Clubhouse. Do you have just a current philosophy on when it makes sense to be super inspired by another product and build it into your existing product versus like, no, you should not do this?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:12:30):\nI think it's always about doing the right thing for the customer. Everyone has always been shameless to be shamelessly inspired by other people's ideas. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think copying ideas can be done in poor taste and can be done with taste. I think some of the people who copied Periscope did so in poor taste, can't blame them. I wouldn't have done it the same way, but it worked. So you can't say it's the wrong thing. I think that it's possible to take ideas in good taste and take ideas in poor taste.\n\n(01:13:07):\nAnd I think with Clubhouse, we actually had been working on audio. Audio was one of those bets I mentioned that we structured very separately with a team of people, many of which were the former",

Audio was one of those bets I mentioned that we structured very separately with a team of people, many of which were the former Periscope team, that when we wound down Periscope, I felt very strongly that there was still something to the idea of synchronous conversations. Because one of the famous things that I think we botched with Periscope is that we always... Our dream and our vision for Periscope and how we talked about it was was a mechanism for teleportation. You could see through someone else's eyes and be teleported somewhere else. It was like that was the story we told ourselves. That was the thing that inspired Periscope. And to a certain extent, a lot of people did use the product for that way. You could go see what it was like someplace in the world where it was something amazing happening or civil unrest happening or some important moment happening with breaking news or otherwise.\n\n(01:13:58):\nBut it turns out the vast majority of our users were not using Periscope that way. It wasn't a rear-facing camera experience where you were showing someone the world, the vast majority of people were using it to just talk to other people. They were bored or they were lonely and they wanted to just have a conversation with other people. And it turns out video and audio is a very interesting way of doing that that allows for more nuance, more long-form conversation, more in-depth conversation, especially in contracts to Twitter, which has mechanics to really incentivize quick, snappy broadcasts that don't lead to much depth. And so when we shut down Periscope, we were like, man, we really need to enable a new form of conversation on Twitter that has some of those properties. And so we had a team that was working on a project that we sort of code named Hydra. Hydra because there were multiple heads on this monster and those heads are participants in a conversation.\n\n(01:14:54):\nAnd so well before Clubhouse was on the map, we had many different iterations of both video and audio only experiences that just didn't feel right, weren't working right, but we felt like we were onto something. And when Clubhouse came on the map, it really re-centered, it put into focus a user experience that felt a lot more right and now give them complete credit for that. Paul and Rohan and that team did an exceptional job crafting an experience that really enabled that mechanic and that premise of enabling these longer form conversations to shine. And so we did shamelessly seek inspiration from what they had done and what had worked and we put our own spin on it. The execution of Spaces within Twitter I think has some similarities, but also really took advantage of the mechanics that you had available to you in Twitter. It's a different product. And so we took the ideas that we felt were shortcuts to making the experience work and then we put our own spin on it. And so I have no problems with what we did there.\n\n(01:15:55):\nAnd having had experienced the pain of not moving quickly enough with Vine from the outside and Periscope having lived that experience, we were not willing to not be the winner with this use case. It is one of the projects I'm most proud of that we worked on at Twitter because we were very radical in our execution. Hydra went from this tiny project that six people were working on that no one knew or care about to, we made Spaces as the number one priority of the company literally above any other project period. And we put a bunch of people on accelerating that product and making it come to life within Twitter. And a lot of that was having felt the pain and burn of fucking this up with Vine and Periscope. And so I'm really proud of our execution. And it was also really energizing. I hope for the company to see that, wow, we pulled that off. So yeah, it was good. It was nice to have that full circle experience and also nice that, personally, I love that aspects of Periscope continue living on within Twitter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:15):\nI did not know that. That is extremely interesting. Speaking full circle, when I joined Clubhouse the first time, Paul was there introducing me to Clubhouse and exactly the way you described Periscope, so I feel like he drew some inspiration from you one step back.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:17:30):\nPaul's amazing. I feel like we're kindred spirits and I could see... It was one of the things I love about that team is just you could just feel how palpable their excitement was and their passion was for what they were building. Another universe we could have worked together more closely, but I think what they built was incredible and we took inspiration from it for sure. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:58):\nSo you've built some of the most successful, most beloved, most used consumer products. You continue to help other founders with their product. I'm curious just if you have any advice for how to get better at building consumer products in terms of maybe craft a product, product sense. What have you learned about what it takes to build a successful consumer product?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:18:19):\nThe best cheat codes for getting better at building products is just being a voracious user of products. And just trying new things, feeling out what works well, what doesn't, what you like, what you don't like. There's",

And just trying new things, feeling out what works well, what doesn't, what you like, what you don't like. There's just no replacement for that. It's such an effective way of honing your own taste and seeing what's superficial but not useful, what's ugly but useful, what's beautiful and useful. And you hone that by having practice and building muscle memory. And so I think there's not a lot of science to it, I think. I mean obviously science can help you become more effective at lots of things. But I feel like I've just always been very curious about trying new things. I'm a very hungry consumer of new things that people are building and I'm not quick to judge. I'll try it even if it seems dumb because sometimes things that seem dumb at the beginning become very meaningful.\n\n(01:19:20):\nAnd so it's always been a very helpful cheat code for me. And it's also just personally interesting. Every tool, even the silly ones, people put their heart and soul into it and it's like an expression of themselves and it's always interesting to see that, to see people's creations and to learn from them and see what you like, what you don't like and how you might create something of your own that borrows from that. So if I could give people any advice through the lens of what's worked for me, it's that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:51):\nSpeaking of trying new things, what are you up to these days?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:19:55):\nI'm building something in the consumer space. I started the company with a couple of co-founders late last year. We're not quite ready to talk about it yet, but hopefully you'll be hearing from us pretty soon. But it's really nice to be back building something again, particularly building something with a small team again after seeing the opposite extreme with a really large company. We've just talked about lots of large company things. But yeah, hopefully you'll be hearing about it soon.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):\nOh man, I think this is breaking news. So mysterious and exciting. Kayvon, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:20:38):\nNo, no, I think we've covered quite a bit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:42):\nWe have. We have indeed. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:20:46):\nI'm going to take a sip of water and then I'll be ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:49):\nOkay, here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:20:54):\nI love reading sci-fi. I just feel like sci-fi and mystery books are so healthy for jogging the imagination. And so some of my favorite books are by Neal Stephenson, I love Cryptonomicon. I love Reamde. I love a book called Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss, which is more like a fantasy book, but I just love escaping reality and thinking about sci-fi, thinking about fantasy is just, it's helpful for the soul and helpful for the imagination. So those are some of my favorite reads because it helps me. I feel like in some weird circular or wandering way, it helps me be more creative and imaginative. And by the way, that's true outside of reading as well. Some of the content that has shaped me, I feel like and help motivate my curiosity and a lot of things I built is sci-fi TV, right? Star Trek is incredible. We used to use as a metaphor for what Periscope was, we would think about Star Trek. It'd be really cool to be able to teleport or get beamed somewhere else in the world and we're not smart enough to go build that device, but what's the closest approximation to that that we can realize through software? Live streaming. So I think that kind of literature or content has always been inspirational for me and I think getting that through books is really healthy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:30):\nOn that note, is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that's inspired you in addition to Star Trek back in the day?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:22:37):\nI mean the most recent movie I saw in theaters was Dune Two, and it was incredible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:41):\nI just saw that.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:22:41):\nIt's insane. I also thought Oppenheimer was... I'm a huge Nolan fan. Oppenheimer was captivating. To have that level of high octane in a biopic consistently for two and a half hours is so hard to pull off. And I thought it was exceptional. TV shows we're watching Tokyo Vice right now, which I really like. I think one of the best TV shows I've watched recently, I mean Succession was amazing, but maybe I'll pull a less popular one, which is Devs also in the sci-fi realm. I think it was a Hulu show. But if you're interested in tech and AI and you want great acting in Nick Offerman, Devs is a pretty amazing show.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:28):\nI haven't heard of",

Have you seen 3 Body Problem yet, by the way? It feels like it's squarely in your wheelhouse.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:23:33):\nI haven't seen it yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):\nOkay.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:23:35):\nAnd it's funny, some content people are talking about it so much that I kind of want to not watch it now because I feel like it's really hard for shows to live up to the hype when you're mid-hype cycle. So I haven't gone around to it yet, but it's definitely on my list. I know it's the type of show that I would love, but I just haven't gone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:54):\nOkay, great. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates you're hiring?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:23:58):\nThe thing that I find is both very illustrative and helpful is just asking people to talk about something they worked on that failed and talk about something they built that succeeded as well. But I think you just learn a lot about self-reflection and their passions. But particularly their self-reflection. If they talk through something that they really cared deeply about that didn't work and why didn't it work? What were the takeaways? What did you learn from it? I think it teaches you about how willing people are to take risks. It tells you have they experienced failure, what they learned from failure. And so I think it's always, you just get to know someone really well. It ends up in a well-rounded understanding of a person, if you can dig into that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:48):\nIs there a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:24:51):\nI love Proplexity. It's really interesting to me how Proplexity is a product that fits in your life and replaces a product that is so ingrained in people's behavior, which is using Google search for some set of use cases. And it's just really incredible to me how quickly Proplexity took that over. It is very hard actually to rewire your muscle memory if you're used to using Google for searching for 15, 20 years or whatever. It was just amazing to me how quickly my go-to became Proplexity. And frankly, it's one of the only non-development tool AI products that actually has retained. A lot of people try and consumer AI products that just aren't really, haven't retained. But Proplexity is one that it's a daily driver for me. It's on my home screen and I love it. I'm very impressed by it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:45):\nAlso a huge fan.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:25:46):\nYeah. Here's a bias one, my wife is actually working on a startup called Particle, and they're the news experience with AI. And what I love about what they're doing is that for the first time they're like they've rethought what the form factor and the unit of content for news stories should be. Articles are a failed format, is my belief, and certainly their belief. And so they've really come up with an elegant and engaging experience for understanding what's happening in the world in a way that's purely powered by AI. And it's awesome. Again, hashtag biased husband, but it's amazing. It's in beta right now. You can sign up on the wait list. The URL is particlenews.ai. They're letting people in on beta. If you sign up, use coupon code hashtag #KayvonLenny. That's not a real code. But yeah, so that's amazing. So that would be my second pick.\n\n(01:26:48):\nI'll give you a non-software one, which is actually a board game that I ran into, that I was gifted actually for my birthday. And it's called Crokinole. Have you heard of this game called Crokinole?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:00):\nI have not.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:27:01):\nSo Crokinole is Canadian. I think it's a Canadian board game and it's amazing to me because I've never seen a game be captivating to all age ranges. I love it. I play with my friends. My parents over Christmas were obsessed with this game. My daughter loves. It's a physical game. You flick a puck, like shuffleboard style, but miniaturized with a totally different set of mechanics. And it was just like seeing this game captivate, people of all age ranges was mind-blowing to me and it's really fun. So maybe a curveball answer for you there, but I think those are some of the products that I've been really enjoying and appreciating lately.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:48):\nThese are awesome answers. What's the name of that game again? I'm going to-\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:27:48):\nCrokinole.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:53):\nOkay. I don't don't know how to spell it, but I'm sure Google will help me figure it out. We'll link to it in the show notes.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:27:56):\nC-R-O",

I don't don't know how to spell it, but I'm sure Google will help me figure it out. We'll link to it in the show notes.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:27:56):\nC-R-O-K-I-N-O-L-E.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:59):\nGreat. I love the K in there. That makes it really fun. And by the way, I think it's also Particle.news looking at it. It's so cool. It's basically bullet points of news items and then it links to all the articles that have written about it. So it just summarizes, here's the things you need to know and it's beautiful.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:28:13):\nYeah, basically they consume and aggregate everything that's happening in the world by among other things, ingesting articles and then crafting these story modules through them that are summarized by AI. And then they let you actually interrogate the news and ask questions. So leveraging LLMs and tool calls, it's able to actually help you understand what's happening in the world. And they also are building a social layer as well. So it was very cool. I'll definitely get you in the beta.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:39):\nThis is actually amazing timing, because I was a huge fan of Artifact, the news app, and they're going away, so this is the next news app, so thanks for sharing that. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with people that you find useful in work or in life?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:28:57):\nSomething that definitely shaped my work ethic and how I work that came from my first boss actually. When I was 14, I had a summer job basically replacing and doing maintenance on fire extinguishers. So I would drive into San Francisco, my boss would pick me up in his truck, we'd go to big commercial buildings, hospitals, high rises, and we would take all the fire extinguishers in the building, hundreds of them to the garage, empty them, fill them, tag them, inspect them. And that was my first job. And I don't even remember if I was getting paid. I was probably getting paid very small amount, but it was just first work experience. And I remember there was this moment that I had finished dealing with my extinguishers and I was just sitting in his truck twiddling my thumbs doing nothing. And my boss came up to me and was like, when you've got nothing to do, sweep never sit around.\n\n(01:29:57):\nAnd it was so funny, it was just very tiny moment, but I've never ever forgotten that. When you got nothing to do sweep. And it had such a profound impact on my work ethic of there's always something you can be doing to move the ball forward and being productive and being impactful. And I'm so grateful that Fred, my boss, had that moment with me. It was like, I don't even think he understands how impactful that was, but it felt so much a life motto, but it definitely stuck with me and shaped how I work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:35):\nI love that you shared that story. I found that quote and story in GQ Magazine turns out is where you talked about this and I was going to ask about it and I didn't and I'm glad you shared it because I love it.\n\n(01:30:47):\nFinal question, we're going to go full circle. Scott Belsky, you're friends with him. What's something people would be surprised about or don't know about Scott, that might be interesting?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:30:58):\nWell, I'll tell you one funny story and then I'll first tell you something I love about Scott. Scott is a great example of someone who I think has driven immense cultural change at a massive, legendary company in Adobe obviously. But the number of transformations that Scott oversaw and led and contributed to at Adobe are incredible. And I'm sure having a fraction of this experience at Twitter, I can appreciate how difficult and challenging and rewarding that was, right? Going from package software to cloud, going from non-AI to AI, going from discrete tools to an integrated suite that worked really elegantly together. I think Scott oversaw a lot of this stuff and it's pretty incredible to see that transformation have been so successful at Adobe. So I love that.\n\n(01:31:55):\nI guess a funny story about Scott that people might not know, I consider him to have been the first Periscoper. So Scott believed in Periscope before it was Periscope, before we had turned it into live video, we had a previous version of our beta that was static photo sharing, same vision, same concept, but the product was called Bounty. And it was like you put a pin somewhere in the world like the Tokyo fish market and someone would respond with a photo of what it looked like there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:25):\nI didn't know that.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:32:26):\nOur vision was still to help you see through someone else's eyes, but the first manifestation was really static and had this marketplace dynamic, and it took us a while to get to the point where we were like, press a button, go live and have it be live video because by definition it's real time rather than static.\n\n(01:32:42):\nAnyways, before we built any of that,",

And it was such an amazing experience because having an investor essentially encourage you down a product direction by showing rather than telling, it was such a great encapsulation of how supportive Scott was and inspiring Scott was as one of our cheerleaders. And I respect him so much for everything he did to help Periscope make happen, and also for betting on us, because he was one of the first people who said yes to investing. He didn't know us, he just believed in us. And that helped everything else come together.

The story reminds me of your Elon's story, where he FaceTimed you, and it also makes me think about your lesson of building consumer products, just using it, being obsessed with it, Scott, just like, here's what it could look like. And actually using the product, not just talking about.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:34:04):\nYeah, he's a great example of that as well. He's definitely a gracious user of all tools and products, and that's why he has really great, really great product sense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:15):\nKayvon, you're amazing. This was so freaking fascinating. There's so many nuggets here. Can't wait for folks to hear this.\n\n(01:34:20):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and learn more and maybe follow up on anything if there's things you want to follow up on potentially? And then, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:34:30):\nPeople can find me on Twitter/X/whatever we're calling it these days. My handle is @kayvz, K-A-Y-V-Z. And yeah, if you're of this podcast and you're working on something cool and you need some help or advice or you're looking for an angel investor, don't hesitate to reach out and would love to try what you're building.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:51):\nAmazing.

    "content": "Judd Antin (00:00:00):\nUser-centered performance refers to customer obsession or user-centered practice that is symbolic rather than focused on learning. It's hugely common, I would argue. It's work we do to signal to each other how customer obsessed we are, not because we want to make a different decision. If your listeners are like, \"I don't do that.\" I'm like, \"Think about it for a second. This is extremely common.\" Every time a PM comes to a researcher at the end of a product process and says, \"Can you just run a quick user study just to validate our assumptions,\" that's user-centered performance. It's too late to matter. We got to ship it. What they want is to check the box. One of my big mantras was, \"We don't validate, we falsify. We are looking to be wrong.\" Many PMs, many designers are not in that place. They do not want to be wrong. They're looking to validate, and that's user-centered performance.\n\nLenny (00:00:54):\nToday my guest is Judd Anton. Judd helped build the user research practice at Facebook. He was a longtime head of research at Airbnb, and his direct reports have gone on to lead research teams at Figma, Notion, Slack, Robinhood, Duolingo, Fair, and other amazing companies. These days, Judd spends his time consulting, helping companies with organizational challenges, product strategy, design, research, hiring, onboarding, and crisis management. In our conversation, we unpack a conclusion that Jud has come to recently about how the user research field is going through a reckoning and what needs to change both within the user research field and how companies leverage user research going forward. \n\n(00:01:37):\nJudd shares what the user research field has gotten wrong over the last decade, how PMs and designers rely on user research too often, and to answer the wrong questions, where user research will continue to provide significant value, and how to best leverage your researchers, why it's important for researchers to think about the business goals more versus just what the users need, what to look for when you're hiring a user researcher, how PMs can be better partners to researchers, and also a phenomenon that I love that Judd describes and often witnesses, that he calls user-centered performance, where everyone acts like they care about the user, but they're just doing it for show and already know what they want to do. This episode has a lot of spicy takes and will probably upset some people, but Judd is sharing some real talk, here, that I think we all need to hear. With that, I bring you Judd Antin after a short word from our sponsors. \n\n(00:02:27):\nThis time of year is prime for career reflection and setting goals for professional growth.

Judd, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast,\n\nJudd Antin (00:04:22):\nLenny, thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:24):\nIt's my pleasure. So we actually worked together at Airbnb for many years. And as I was preparing for this, I realized how many of the people that you managed went on to do amazing things. So I'm just going to read a list of people that worked for you and what they do now. We had Matt Gallivan, who now leads research at Slack. We have Janna Bray, who leads research at Notion, Celeste Ridlen, who leads research at Robinhood. Rebecca Grey, who leads research at Fair, Hannah Pileggi, who I think was leading research at Duolingo, Louise Beryl, who leads research at Figma, and then Noam, who was leading research at Wealthfront. I think he moved on to something else. What a fricking crazy alumni community and group from this one team that you hired and incubated.\n\nJudd Antin",

I can't take credit for it. They're just outstanding people. And I'm glad the diaspora is out there, because these people, rock stars.\n\nLenny (00:05:23):\nOkay. The main reason that I wanted to do a podcast episode with you is that you wrote this piece that was titled The User Research Reckoning is Here, which I understand caused quite a stir in the research community and I think adjacent communities. And let me just read one of your takeaways at the top of your post to give people a sense of what it was about. You wrote, \"The user research discipline over the last 15 years is dying. The reckoning is here. The discipline can still survive and thrive, but we'd better adapt, and quick.\" Before we get into the meat of the piece, could you share a bit about just the reaction to this piece and maybe if it was a surprise and what you expected would happen when you put this out?\n\nJudd Antin (00:06:06):\nYeah, I was definitely surprised. I wrote it because I wanted to start a conversation about something I was thinking about. I didn't really know who would read it. And in the end it turned out a lot of people read it. I learned that using the word reckoning may have been a mistake because it inspires a lot of drama in a conversation that I wanted to be really productive and positive. Overall, I would say, though, that the response was very positive. It seemed to resonate with a lot of people who reached out to me. I spent a lot of time talking to teams, to designers, to researchers, but there were also a ton of critiques. \n\n(00:06:43):\nI would say some of it was like people thought I was throwing research or researchers under the bus, like, \"It's researchers' fault. We're doing it wrong.\" Which I don't believe at all. And that I wasn't taking responsibility as a research leader or a design leader myself. And the most interesting one I would say was the anti-capitalist crew, because one of my points that we'll talk about is that I think researchers need to be more profit focused. And there are a lot of people out there who, I think they think that's not cool or not research's job, and I'm like, \"Well, what are we doing then, if we're not helping businesses succeed?\" But that was the most surprising critique, for sure.\n\nLenny (00:07:23):\nI've worked with some of those people who are just like, \"Why are we growing? Why do we focus so much on growth? Why do we need to grow this business?\"\n\nJudd Antin (00:07:29):\nYeah. \n\nLenny (00:07:29):\nSo I get that. \n\nJudd Antin (00:07:30):\nMaybe it's the wrong industry for them.\n\nLenny (00:07:32):\nYeah. I'm not a fan of that. Okay. Let's actually dig into the meat of your message, and the big takeaway, and the conclusion of what you're finding is happening in user research. And I know a lot of this comes from a lot of user researchers have been laid off at a lot of companies. It was one of the hardest hit teams. And so I think a lot of this comes from that. So yeah, so let's just start big and then see where it goes.\n\nJudd Antin (00:07:53):\nSo yeah, everybody who's paying attention has noticed that there have been a bunch of layoffs. And I think back in the summer I was thinking, \"Listen, this seems to be hitting UX and UX research particularly hard. Is there something going on? Is there a bigger picture?\" The reason I use the word reckoning is because to me that's like, \"Hey, a moment to take stock.\" And triggered by the fact that a lot of wonderful humans may have lost their jobs, and many more are afraid of losing their jobs. And so if it's a sign, the fact that research has been hit so hard, it's a sign of what? And so the thesis of my article is really, it's a sign that maybe the system is a little more broken than we think and that research is not driving the value or impact that it should or could. And that's for a bunch of reasons, I think. Some of it is stuff that research can do better, and a lot of it is how research is integrated and positioned in companies. \n\n(00:08:46):\nAnd at the root of all that, I think, is that we're just doing too much of what I would consider the wrong type of research. And what I mean by the wrong type of research is I have this framework, and it's in the article, macro, middle range, and micro research, at least three ways to talk about it. And it's pretty simple, the intuition of what those are. So macro research is big picture, strategic, business focused, forward-looking innovation, look at the market, look at competitors, long-term research to understand where the product should go next, stuff like that. \n\n(00:09:20):\nAnd then you have micro research, which a lot of really technical",

So macro research is big picture, strategic, business focused, forward-looking innovation, look at the market, look at competitors, long-term research to understand where the product should go next, stuff like that. \n\n(00:09:20):\nAnd then you have micro research, which a lot of really technical usability falls into this, all the beautiful stuff that researchers do to enable a really high quality, excellent, pixel perfect thing to go out the door, laser-focused research to understand AB test results, stuff like that. And then you have this middle range, which is this blobular place where the research questions are middle altitude and a lot of the core, let's say user understanding questions fall here. And a lot of what research is doing is research in that space. It's, \"Let's take a group of people and ask some questions about how they think, feel, behave, how they're using a product or not using a product.\" And it's just this devastating mix of really interesting to many, including researchers, and not impactful enough for the business. That's the core thesis. Researchers do it because it's interesting, but honestly, and a thing we should talk about, Lenny, is researchers also do it because it's the kind of work we most often get asked to do. \n\nLenny (00:10:22):\nYeah. That's exactly what I was thinking. As a PM, that's what I want to get answers to, is like, \"How should we think about this one product?\" And I totally get this.\n\nJudd Antin (00:10:31):\nYeah. The questions turn out to be really interesting and there are many cases at many companies where it's super impactful. But the problem with those types of questions is they tend to, they trigger all the worst stuff that researchers experience. So they yield results which are interesting, but sometimes hard to operationalize. They trigger the post hoc bias, really, really, really well where a lot of people can say confidently like, \"Oh, that was obvious. We knew that already.\" And they fulfill this need for us to feel and be customer obsessed, user-centered, without changing anything. So doing too much of that research to me is a symptom of a broken system, and where companies are really different from each other. I heard from so many after this article and they're like, \"Well, my company and my industry is like this or not like this.\" \n\n(00:11:24):\nBut in tech, we spent the last many years hiring, hiring, hiring researchers, but maybe, I'm sure most of your listeners are familiar with the idea of a ZIRP. Maybe it was a zero interest base phenomenon, where it was okay when the money was easy, to hire researchers, even though we were not setting them up properly. We're were going to set them up to fail. We set them up as a service function. We didn't know what research was for. We didn't know how to really drive impact with it. And that's where the reckoning comes from. It's like that era is over. Research, I think, is more crucial than ever. Good, great researchers are more impactful than ever. But it's in a new space. We're in a new space now.\n\nLenny (00:12:05):\nI want to make sure people understand this framework. And specifically, how would you best describe the difference between this middle range research and macro research?\n\nJudd Antin (00:12:16):\nMiddle range research is usually focused on a more specific set of research questions or a constituency. So if macro is like, \"Let's understand the overall competitive landscape. Let's do a concept car type project where we really look ahead. Let's get involved with strategic planning,\" which is a wonderful thing for researchers to do, do TAM studies, other things like that, that stuff lives in the macro space. \n\n(00:12:42):\nThe middle range space is like, what's a good example? \"We want to know how Airbnb hosts feel about their payment options.\" That's a really interesting, reasonable question. And we can go out and do research on that, but it's not that specific. It's not really targeted at a business problem yet. It could be. Maybe that's a result of the research, but it yields these middle range insights in which we've learned things like, \"Well, hosts want flexibility about their payment options.\" I'm making this up. And that's a good example where it's like, \"It's not that that's not an interesting set of questions, it's just not quite pointed enough.\" And it's not framed in the language of the funnel, or the business strategy, or the OKRs. It's not quite enough aligned enough to that. It's too blobular in that middle level and it ends up not driving impact.\n\nLenny (00:13:38):\nI think it also leads to a lot of the things as you described, people don't like about research. It delays everything. You have to wait for the research to be done to have an answer, to make a clear decision. It also creates this issue that people complain about, that PMs and product teams don't want to just make a decision on their own. They're like, \"I will get this additional data point and make sure research tells us this is the right answer instead of just trusting there.\" God, I guess maybe along those lines, this might be going off a little track, but what's your advice there for, say, product managers or PMs or product teams to not necessarily rely on research for that middle research?\n\nJudd Antin (00:14:14):\nI think the reason why so many PMs ask for those middle range questions is because they haven't really gotten deep with their researcher",

So if the question is like, \"Hey, Judd, you just pointed out a bunch of problems, can you be more solutions oriented?\" Well, the solution is simple but not easy to me. It's that we need to restructure the way we make products in a way which integrates research much more fully. It looks like consistent relationships in which researchers, and the work, and the insights they provide are a part of the process from beginning to end.\n\n(00:14:51):\nAnd I think, Lenny, you as a PM, that's how you worked. I remember you, I know who you worked with. You worked with great researchers. But honestly, most product processes are not that way. And so that's when research is a service function. It gets called in right at the end. It's reactive in the sense that a researcher in the room listening and participating in the conversation could have a ton of impact on framing exactly the right question that will drive maximum business impact, maximum product improvement at that moment, and then go do it quick, and get back, and we're onto the next. But they weren't there, the relationship wasn't there. They're not engaged in the project from the beginning. And that's the number one root of the problem. As long as research is a service discipline, I think we're going to be stuck in this spot.\n\nLenny (00:15:37):\nWhen people might be hearing this, on the one hand, it's research has been not as helpful to teams as they thought, and researchers have been spending time on the wrong thing. On the other hand, your advice is integrate research from the beginning, make them more involved throughout. And I think that might confuse people. How should people think about, like, \"Research is actually more important? You should integrate them more deeply.\"\n\nJudd Antin (00:15:59):\nThere's a vicious cycle that's been happening, is from where I sit, and this is what I hear from many, many researchers and research leaders, which is a lot of companies hired a lot of researchers with great intentions, didn't quite know how to integrate them. And UX research is a newer discipline, so maybe that's not surprising. We're still learning how to use it. \"Cool, let's evolve.\" But a lot of companies hired these people, but they hired them into kind of like a service discipline, very reactive, not in the room, not integrated in the way I said. \n\n(00:16:30):\nAnd so they had less input on the questions to ask, or they're included, but only at the end. And then they're unable to build those direct relationships, to be there in the room to actually drive the questions and insert insights. Because a good researcher is like the repository of insights you need for growth, but they're not there. They don't participate in the decision. So they end up doing research. They have jobs to do, so they do research that is too reactive, it doesn't matter, and then it's less impactful. Executives conclude that therefore researchers are not as impactful and then they get sidelined or laid off and the cycle continues. \n\n(00:17:07):\nSo I think the short circuit is the constant engagement. If you take a great researcher and you insert them consistently in a product process, I feel confident that researcher will drive a product improvement, metrics impact, growth, all the things that you want to see as a PM and a product leader. It's just that's the exception, not the norm these days.\n\nLenny (00:17:31):\nThis may be a hard question to answer, but when people hear, \"If you have a great researcher, here's how you approach it.\" What are signals that your researchers is great versus not great? What are some things people could look for to tell them, like, \"Oh, maybe I have the wrong researcher on my team.\"\n\nJudd Antin (00:17:44):\nThe best researchers I think are first of all, multi method. The first iteration of user research was primarily a qualitative discipline. But a strong opinion that I have is that is largely one of those models that needs to evolve. It's not that qualitative user research is no longer important. It's that the best researchers have five tools. I think they have five tools. And those five tools are number one, what we would call formative or generative user experience research. So looking ahead, innovation focused, really open-ended, maybe more ethnographic, \"Let's go out into the field and talk to host and guests on Airbnb. Let's see people using our product in the field,\" stuff like that. So that's formative. \n\n(00:18:27):\nThe second type is evaluative, so more like usability testing. The third tool is a basic rigorous survey design. It's the best scaled way to get responses from communities small and large. You can get a lot out of really well crafted surveys. But to do that, you have to have the fourth tool, which is applied statistics, the best research, know a little bit of stats. You can't interact in a world of AB testing without knowing basic statistics. \n\n(00:18:56):\nAnd then in the old version of this, the fifth tool was SQL, because I think good researchers need to be able to run their own queries. These days, so much of that is dashboarded",

These days, so much of that is dashboarded, that the fifth tool may now be prompt engineering, which is a thing we could talk about, but I think maybe that's the fifth tool is somewhere, is it technical skills that fall in between querying your own data, understanding it very well in companies that are awash with data and then interacting with generative AI.\n\nLenny (00:19:24):\nAmazing. That's such a cool list. Okay, so just to playback, formative, generative, innovative skills to think bigger and come up with new ideas, usability.\n\nJudd Antin (00:19:35):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:19:35):\nYeah, usability. How did you describe it? I have a different word, here. Evaluate? Evaluative?\n\nJudd Antin (00:19:41):\nEvaluative, right.\n\nLenny (00:19:41):\nOkay.\n\nJudd Antin (00:19:41):\nSo we're evaluating products and doing more. Really that's the micro level of research. \n\nLenny (00:19:47):\nSurvey design, being really rigorous about it, applied statistics, and then SQL/dashboard/prompt engineering. \n\nJudd Antin (00:19:53):\nRight. \n\nLenny (00:19:54):\nMaybe just one last question along this thread, also a big question, but any advice for how to evaluate these skills/interview for them? I know this is its own deep topic, but any advice for someone trying to find this person?\n\nJudd Antin (00:20:05):\nI've interviewed hundreds or thousands of researchers, and the way I usually approach that is you want a researcher who's got a Swiss army knife, because if all you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. And so if you give in the context of an interview, let's say, a researcher, a pretty juicy, open-ended research question, and you want to see how they handle it, and a good answer is usually multi-method. We're not going to handle it in any one way. We're going to say, \"Well, here's a couple of ways we could deal with this. Here's how we could do this in a day, or a week, or a month.\" We usually don't have a month, but sometimes big research projects go on for that long. \"And here are the different sets of methods that we can use.\" \n\n(00:20:44):\nSo see where they go. It's actually pretty simple. Most researchers are deeper in one than the other, and sometimes you can make up for those five tools with the team. So you have experts who are t-shaped, but maybe deeper in one or several of those ways. But when I built a team at Meta and at Airbnb, that was my goal, is individually as researchers build up those tools and then as a team build deep expertise that would fill all the gaps.\n\nLenny (00:21:10):\nComing back to the main premise of your post, one of your big takeaways is, \"Researchers need to be much more business oriented, thinking about what helps the business versus the user.\" Which I think to a lot of researchers will feel really weird. Can you just talk about your takeaways there?\n\nJudd Antin (00:21:25):\nSo much of user experience practice, not just research, but design too, is focused on empathy and very user-centered. This is beautiful. I'm not saying that we should abandon that. I think what I'm saying is there's an overlapping event, where you have the user and profit or the business. And what researchers need to do is be way more explicit about finding that overlap. So one thing, when researchers ask for advice, they're like, \"Well, what should I do to be more business or profit focused?\" I say something like, \"Did you read the last quarterly report, If it's a public company? Did you listen to the shareholder call?\" And they're probably like, \"No, it's full of a bunch of language I didn't quite get.\" \n\n(00:22:12):\nAnd I'm like, \"Yep.\" So there you go. That's the language you need to learn. Scour your Google Drive folder, your internal folder and look for all of the documents that are about this quarter, or this halves, or next half strategy. What are the OKRs? Understand the metrics and the conversion funnel, know it back and forward, because then what you're doing is you're proposing, if you're in the active conversation, you're saying, 'Cool, I hear you asking that research question. I've identified this is exactly the spot in the funnel where I think we need to do work. There's an opportunity here. Or that competitor is eating our lunch with this group of users. I know that because I read the competitive report and I understand it deeply.'\" So those are skills that some researchers have and a lot are building these days, but historically, last 15 years, it hasn't been a thing we've been as focused on, and I think that's an evolution that needs to happen.\n\nLenny (00:23:06):\nI think a lot of PMs listening to this are going to be like, \"Hallelujah.\" This is exactly what I've been trying to convince people of. It's what I've been trying to convince my researchers of, and design often falls into this.\n\nJudd Antin (00:23",

It's what I've been trying to convince my researchers of, and design often falls into this.\n\nJudd Antin (00:23:17):\nBut Lenny, the opposite is true, too, because you got to take the average PM who lives in that land, all day, every day, and what they do is not in the Venn. I think those are people who are also performing customer centricity and performing user-centeredness a lot, when they're really not interested. And so this is not about researcher. This takes two sides. Fixing this broken system takes everyone, researchers, PMs, designers, everyone at a company, but also the way that organization is structured, and integrating itself in a different way. Everybody's got to come to the table.\n\nLenny (00:23:55):\nSuch a good point. And you have this actual term that you call user-centered performance, where it's the performance of being user-centered. Can you talk about that and then just what advice you'd give to PMs that, hearing this, are like, \"Yes, I love everything you're saying,\" and then not realizing maybe they're too far in that extreme?\n\nJudd Antin (00:24:11):\nUser-centered performance is a term I made up, because it's fun to make up terms. And it refers to customer obsession or a user-centered practice that is symbolic rather than focused on learning. So it's hugely common, I would argue. It's work we do to signal to each other how customer obsessed we are, not because we want to make a different decision. And if your listeners are like, \"I don't do that.\" I'm like, \"Think about it for a second.\" Because this is extremely common. It shows up in explicit ways and implicit ways. \n\n(00:24:52):\nSo explicitly, I would say every time a PM comes to a researcher at the end of a product process and says, \"Can you just run a quick user study just to validate our assumptions?\" That's user-centered performance. It's too late to matter. That PM is not interested in being wrong at all. It's too late in the game for that. We got to ship it. What they want is to check the box. So any check the box style research is a wild example of user-centered performance. \n\n(00:25:22):\nI would argue every researcher has probably had to do executive listening sessions because a lot of PMs, founders, product people, but designers, too, they want to get close to the customer. And so, like, \"Can I do some focus groups? I want to be there. I want to ask them questions.\" This is 97% performance. It's well-intentioned, but it isn't focused on learning. It isn't going to drive better outcomes or more impact. \n\n(00:25:49):\nAnd then there's all these implicit ways that people engage in that kind of user performance, too. A lot of it comes down to cognitive biases, confirmation bias, ego. One of my big mantras was, \"We don't validate, we falsify. We are looking to be wrong.\" That is the mindset you should use when you're approaching insights and research. \"I want to be wrong. I want you to do research that shows we were off base in the following ways. Tell me exactly how and why in a way that allows me to fix it quickly.\" But many PMs, many designers are not in that place. They do not want to be wrong. They're looking to validate. And that's user-centered performance.\n\nLenny (00:26:29):\nOh, man. I think a lot of people are hearing this and feeling exposed.\n\nJudd Antin (00:26:33):\nExposed.\n\nLenny (00:26:35):\nI feel like you're like this Deep Throat person coming from sharing these things people don't want to talk about at the office.\n\nJudd Antin (00:26:35):\nI know.\n\nLenny (00:26:42):\nThere's this quote in your post I'm going to read. \"Product managers love to ask for middle range research that they can use to justify decisions they're reluctant to make on their own. User designers love to ask for middle range research because it fits their model of what proper design process should look like. Executives love to ask for middle range because they don't really understand what research is for, and helps them do performative user-centeredness. In the end, they will decide based on their own opinions.\"\n\nJudd Antin (00:27:07):\nThere is an important place for intuition in product development, of course. The best designers, researchers, product people develop strong intuition for the product. But you got to understand, intuition is where all of those biases lie. It's where all your blind spots are. And what great insights people do, what great researchers do when you're next to them all the time, is they'll expose you. I don't have to be the Deep Throat, because you have somebody who's professional job is ... Keeping you honest is probably the wrong way to put it, but as somebody whose capabilities are about expanding your horizons, making it so that your intuition is constantly improving, you don't have to rely on it when your intuition and the evidence sort of collide in a way that either affirms or falsifies the product decision you made. Now something really good is happening. \n\n(00:28:00):\nAnd the other thing that is inherent in that quote is I, at Airbnb,",

Now something really good is happening. \n\n(00:28:00):\nAnd the other thing that is inherent in that quote is I, at Airbnb, wore many hats over the years. I was head of research two different times. I was head of design for guest products. And my last job was I was head of the design studio, so UX research, UX design, writing, localization, they all reported up to me. So I've seen this from many disciplinary angles in the UX field. And researchers aren't the only ones who are guilty of this. I would say design has a ton of performance. And it comes from the fact that we have figured out user-centered design, this process, or design thinking, which IDEO popularized. Like, \"That's what we're supposed to do, right? Bezos told us that we, as PMs, had to be customer obsessed. So that's what we're supposed to do.\"\n\n(00:28:48):\nIt's a really common and damaging thing when we don't genuinely have that growth learning mindset, and it's easy to sideline researchers. We don't need them in that situation. We've got our guts. Isn't the gut where a great PM, a great founder needs to have that gut? And they do, but they need to be open to the fact that your gut, is limited, and biased, and narrow, and wrong sometimes.\n\nLenny (00:29:13):\nThe two sides of this is trust your gut opinion, \"I don't need research, I don't need data. I have opinions, and my own experience, and I'm going to use the product, and let's just go with what feels right to me.\" Versus pure data-driven research driven for designers that are maybe listening for product managers. Do you have any advice for just where to fall on that spectrum and just how to best leverage research to inform that opinion?\n\nJudd Antin (00:29:36):\nYeah, I taught a class at UC Berkeley this semester on leadership, and we talk about that a lot, because great leaders develop intuition. It's the pattern matching part of experience, where you develop heuristics which allow you to make good judgments even if you can't quite explain where that judgment came from. That's what the gut is. But it's also, like I said, where bias comes from, where all the cognitive biases, there's a list of 151 of them on Wikipedia, I won't name them, but all those thorny things that lead us astray, the behavioral economists and social psychologists study, those live in the gut. And so the advice is when you are looking to check your gut, you have to do that thing. A lot of your listeners have probably read Thinking Fast and Slow, System 1, System 2. Right? \n\nLenny (00:30:29):\nI have it here, right under my laptop, actually, holding up my laptop screen. \n\nJudd Antin (00:30:32):\nThat's so appropriate, Lenny. So the secret is not that sexy. It's System 2. So you engage that slow, methodical process in which you do analytic thinking as a means of checking your gut. Slow in the grand scheme of things. Slow meaning not a split second decision, not like months of analysis. That's not what I mean. \n\n(00:30:54):\nThe other thing you can do, and there's really great research on this, is you bring in the wisdom of the crowd. So the wisdom of the crowd is a phrase a lot of people are familiar with, and it works in a specific situation. The wisdom of the crowd works when the people involved with the decision are bringing diverse sources of information and judgment to the table. Obviously, if everybody has the same sources of information, then it doesn't matter how many people are out there. So if you want to check your gut, get a bunch of different guts together, get a bunch of different people in the room who can bring evidence and intuition to bear, and have an open, direct end kind conversation in which we might disagree. You know who's great at that? Researchers\n\nLenny (00:31:38):\nLeading those discussions essentially, and getting a bunch of people's opinions.\n\nJudd Antin (00:31:41):\nYeah, this is the structural solution I'm talking about, Lenny, is like, \"I never asked for research teams to have their own separate OKRs.\" I said two things, \"Number one, what's the teams? Shouldn't the PMs, the engineers, the designers and the research, everybody should have the same set of metrics for success because either we're doing it together or we're not.\" And then I said, \"My metric for success is when they won't have that meeting without you.\" That's my metric for success. If they cannot have that decision making meeting without the researcher there, that means you've developed influence, strong, trusting relationships, you're an active participant in the process, not just somebody who provides input into someone else's process. And that is when researchers can have huge impact.\n\nLenny (00:32:29):\nI think of the PM role in a similar way, even though people won't have these meetings with PMs, because they're often at the center of lot of the stuff, but you want to be a PM that people want on their team. There's a lot of teams that are like, \"We don't want and PMs, we don't need product managers. They just get in the way.\" And I find that that's only the case when the product manager's not great,",

The grease, I-\n\nLenny (00:32:51):\nThe grease.\n\nJudd Antin (00:32:53):\n... love it.\n\nLenny (00:32:54):\nYou mentioned also, before we started recording, that the biggest challenge for user researchers is in their relationship with their product manager. Can you speak to that and what you've seen there?\n\nJudd Antin (00:33:04):\nI'm wary of overgeneralizing, but I can tell you that from my experience and from what I hear, the product research or product insights relationship is one of the most challenged. And I think it comes from the fact that fundamentally, many researchers are just not included in the process that PMs are running. And then, actually, I did some asking around before this podcast, and so I thought, \"There are some tropes that researchers have about PMs that are worth PMs knowing, just like four or five of them, the things that researchers know PMs say, which drive us nuts because they're not true.\" \n\n(00:33:51):\nSo the first one is that research just slows us down. Research is too slow. This is bullshit. A great research team can do research in a day, a week, or a month. It just depends on what you want to get out of it, like, \"How much detail do you need? How many people do we need to talk to? What is the depth or breadth? Do we need to go to seven different countries to talk about our constituencies in Latin America?\" Well, that's not going to happen overnight, but we don't often need that. The other way to look at that is that is it slower to get it wrong and fix it than to take a hot second to do the work to get it right the first time? So that's BS. Good research doesn't slow us down, it speeds us up.\n\nLenny (00:34:36):\nAnd also just along those lines, a big part of your premise is you don't need to do as much research as people are doing, like this middle research that a lot of the time is put into. \n\nJudd Antin (00:34:45):\nYeah. Research can go super fast. I think especially, so the macro level research, I hope what it is tied to things like annual planning processes. We did a thing at Airbnb several years that we called, it was like Insights 2019, Insights 2020. They were concept car projects. And we spent quite a long time synthesizing the entire year's worth of insights from every place we could get them and then developing with designers and engineers like a concept car for five years in the future. So that's a long process. \n\n(00:35:16):\nBut the micro level, there's so much business value to be derived there, so much business value, and it can go so fast, Lenny, it can go so fast. You can have results in 48 hours on these things. We did a thing at Airbnb. There's a famous story which I'll only tell in the abstract, because I don't want to out anything, but we call it the multimillion dollar button. And basically we did research which revealed that people weren't going down the purchase funnel because they were afraid. The calls to actions on the button was making them afraid that it would initiate a purchase when really it was just taking the next step. \n\n(00:35:58):\nWe changed the text on the button with help from our amazing content design, our UX writing team. We basically changed seven characters and made Airbnb millions of dollars, because what we found out was really simple. It was just like, \"Hey, this button feels scary. The CTA on the button feels scary.\" So that's a great example of how micro ... And that happened in like 48 hours, we would discover that insight, or overnight, basically. And we were like, \"Hm, maybe we should test some other CTAs.\" We did the conversion, we added like 1%, which is really, really hard to do. So that's a quick example of how that type of quick research can drive a huge amount of business value.\n\nLenny (00:36:39):\nThis episode is brought to you by Ahrefs.

That's A-H-R-E-F-S.com/A-W-T. \n\n(00:37:29):\nSo just to make this even clearer, I think this middle research zone is the stuff that does slow people down, I imagine. It's like, \"What are the challenges hosts have with payments on Airbnb?\" What you're basically saying is, \"Spend your time doing the micro stuff like usability research and then the bigger stuff that's part of overall planning. That's part of the planning cycle. It's not like every project you're working on, you need to have a whole research project on.\"\n\nJudd Antin (00:37:55):\nExactly. The micro research should be much more common. A lot of researchers think that that's scut work, that usability is something junior researchers do. I completely disagree. I think we need to get back there as an industry and be like, \"When you make a product easier to use, when you discover problems with functionality, business metrics we care about will go up.\" I've seen it happen. But that's not just work for interns and new grads, that's for sure. \n\n(00:38:24):\nAnd then the planning process, absolutely. If we're integrated from beginning to end, we can help. And the thing about that middle range, I think you're right. That's the stuff that makes the stereotype that research is slow, and a lot of times it's also because it's just not pointed enough. The researcher can also say in that moment, \"I have studied the business plan. I know exactly where, I've seen the metrics trend, I have an idea about exactly where that's going to go.\" We still need to do that middle range research. The question is valuable, but it's now very pointed and the time is worth it.\n\nLenny (00:38:58):\nAmazing. Okay, I want to cure the rest of these tropes.\n\nJudd Antin (00:39:01):\nOkay, research is too slow is the first one. The second one, I can do my own research. Why do I need researchers? And that's true, as product people, I hope you are engaging with customers and listening well. But no offense, garbage in, garbage out. The thing is, anyone can talk to a user. That does not constitute research or insights work because one user can be powerful, but one user can be idiosyncratic. And a researcher knows how to get to the heart of that really quick. They know how to take that conversation, and understand, and situate it in a way which means like, \"Sure, democratize research. That's happening. There are tools out there that will let anybody get customer feedback, voice a customer type stuff.\" But a researcher is there to help you turn garbage into something that's not garbage and avoid the bias that can come from you just reaching out to your cousin's family and then doing whatever they thought you should do to the product. So that's the second trope. \n\n(00:40:08):\nThe third one is AB test everything. And AB tests are great, but one of my most painful things to do is to sit in a room full of PMs and data scientists who have just seen the results of an experiment that flipped a stat sig, and then they're like, \"Cool, I was significantly down over this course of time for these users.\" And then they just start speculating about why that is, because the AB test rarely tells you why it changed in the way it did. And then this endless flywheel of AB testing goes and I'm like, \"Hey, you don't have to guess. I know somebody who can get you an answer or at least evidence that addresses the question of why did we see the test result we did in a very short amount of time? Or you could use your customers as Guinea pigs, and throw more experiments at them over and over, and spend a long time on it, and come to the same place in the end.\"\n\nLenny (00:41:03):\nI think a similar critique that PMs often have is AB testing is conclusive scientifically, statistically, user research is just talking to a bunch of people. Why would I trust that? What is your best way to help PMs realize that this is actually very valuable data and you should listen to it? It's not just, you know, a story here and there. \n\nJudd Antin (00:41:26):\nYeah. No, I think they're both right. AB testing is as close as we can get to making causal claims about products. Research is usually not oriented towards making causal claims or it should not be, but those causal claims rarely tell you how and why things happen. And if you want to not make that mistake again in the future, you need to know how and why. If you want to build a better product in a way that doesn't just answer this narrow question that an AB test answered, you need to know how and why. And so you need both. Beautiful partnerships between data scientists and research and insights people are, I think what we're going to see in that next evolution. And if you set that virtuous cycle up, if you set up the engagement where those people are involved from the beginning, you don't make those mistakes. You get the causal relationship, which is valuable for one reason and the hows and whys, which are valuable for other reasons. \n\nLenny (00:42:19):\nAwesome. Okay. I think there's two more tropes you had. \n\nJudd Antin (00:42:23):\nOne of them is a simple",

I think there's two more tropes you had. \n\nJudd Antin (00:42:23):\nOne of them is a simple one, which is like everyone loves to quote that it turns out a totally apocryphal Henry Ford quote about, \"If I'd asked my users.\" It turns out to the best of our knowledge, he did not say that. And-\n\nLenny (00:42:35):\nReally? What?\n\nJudd Antin (00:42:36):\nYeah, I know. Isn't that sad? \n\nLenny (00:42:36):\nI didn't know that.\n\nJudd Antin (00:42:38):\nI know. Sorry to burst your bubble, Lenny. \n\nLenny (00:42:40):\nOh, wow. \n\nJudd Antin (00:42:41):\nWho was-\n\nLenny (00:42:41):\nDoes anyone say anything? I feel like every quote is-\n\nJudd Antin (00:42:44):\nIs apocryphal, now? I know. \n\nLenny (00:42:46):\nYeah. What is reality? Geez, can we? Well, let's just- \n\nJudd Antin (00:42:49):\nOkay, maybe he said that. He certainly believed that. That's what the historians say. But the reason that makes researchers so angry is because that's not research. That's not what researchers do. A researcher who's going to ask customers what they want is a bad researcher. You need a different researcher. I've never done that in my career. No one on my team has ever run a study that's like that. So that just makes researchers mad.\n\n(00:43:16):\nAnd then the last one is about post-hoc bias. It's, \"We knew this already. That was obvious.\" And I think a lot about this book, which I would recommend to your listeners. The author is a sociologist at UPenn named Duncan Watts, and the title is Everything is Obvious If You Already Know the Answer. And it's about hindsight bias. He makes the argument that we rely too much on intuition, heuristics, and pattern matching in a way that is inappropriate to our experience. And it's like it leads us astray. It's like a form of self gaslighting. And it happens because we end up selectively remembering things and then constructing narratives around them in a way which makes us feel like we already knew that, when we in fact did not.\n\n(00:44:05):\nAnd he talks about this other, one of those cognitive biases called the narrative fallacy, which is the idea that people love to make convenient, simple stories about the past. If I asked you about your career, Lenny, and how you got to be this amazing podcast host, you'd be like, \"Well, let me tell you about this series of events.\" And we do that. It's part of how we make sense of our lives and the information around us, but it would probably be a lie in the sense that we all twist the evidence we have to fit the narrative we want to be true, because it's simple, and lovely, and makes us happy.\n\nLenny (00:44:36):\nThis is going to sound self-serving, but I find I'm the opposite. I'm like, \"I have no idea how this all came about. Here's some things that happened, and somehow I ended up here.\" But maybe I'm being very modest and try to not give myself any credit.\n\nJudd Antin (00:44:49):\nThat's beautiful.\n\nLenny (00:44:50):\nThank you for these tropes, by the way. This was fun. I didn't know you were going to do that. So that's a fun, little collection we've got, here. \n\nJudd Antin (00:44:54):\nThanks.\n\nLenny (00:44:56):\nI wanted to ask about, there's this tweet by Patrick Collison that I've brought up a couple of times on this podcast, that I think is really interesting. And his tweet is this, \"In my opinion, the best product will stem from a very strong mental model of the domain and user. User research can help you get such a model and validate it along the way. But it's important to view the syllogism of UXR as model of user research, to improving your mental model of the user, to what product you should build versus user research tells you what product to build.\" Does that resonate in any way thoughts on that way of thinking about user research?\n\nJudd Antin (00:45:34):\nYeah, there's a double-edged sword we talk about a lot in the research community, which is about making recommendations for design. So the best research doesn't leave it at that. It tells you, and it's like the what, the so what, and then the then what. But the problem with that is some researchers go too far in the other direction, where they're like, \"We ran this study, it yielded these insights, and therefore this is what we should build.\" And everyone else on the team is like, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Glad to hear your thoughts on the matter, but there's a lot going on here. Maybe we should talk about it.\" And that makes perfect sense. That's a failure of communication. \n\n(00:46:19):\nAnd I think that speaks to the thing that Patrick is saying, is like, \"Good research can sometimes tell",

That's a failure of communication. \n\n(00:46:19):\nAnd I think that speaks to the thing that Patrick is saying, is like, \"Good research can sometimes tell us exactly what the problem is and exactly how to fix it.\" An example of that is the multimillion dollar button I told you about. But in a lot of the bigger picture questions, especially the macro ones and maybe also the really pointed middle range ones, the point isn't really, \"This is exactly what we should do and this is exactly what we should build.\" It is, \"Let us develop a framework which is based on actual evidence, and then together as a team figure out how we want to experiment our way to a successful product.\"\n\nLenny (00:46:53):\nTo close the loop on this specific thread, what is your advice to teams, researchers to help move out of this reckoning, and to move forward, and help the field, both from a user researcher perspective and also from just a company that maybe laid off a bunch of user researchers or is trying to decide what to do with their researchers?\n\nJudd Antin (00:47:14):\nThank you for asking. I think I said to you earlier, and I feel some pressure as maybe the first conversation that you've had specifically about research on this podcast.\n\nLenny (00:47:23):\nYeah, I think so. \n\nJudd Antin (00:47:25):\nAnd I want to help. I believe so much in this discipline of research and insights, and I think when I said, \"The UX research discipline of the last 15 years is dying,\" I didn't mean that I think research is dying, far from it. I think that there's a version of it, which we're now moving past and into a new version. We're going through an evolution, as many do. And so the question for me is like, \"How can researchers, and the companies, and the other people with whom they work create a new version, a different version, an evolution, which is hugely impactful for the business?\" \n\n(00:47:57):\nAnd so the advice I'd give to researchers about that is develop diverse research skills. Remembering the five or five and a half tool list that I mentioned earlier, really go deep on that business knowledge, so speaking the language of product, and business, and metrics, and understanding exactly how to use your insights like a scalpel, building those strong relationships, which is not a thing that researchers can do by themselves. It requires two-way engagements, and also in a way which allows researchers to do fewer things better. \n\n(00:48:30):\nSo most researchers that I know are working on teams where they're like, \"I'm the only researcher, and I have seven PMs and 20 designers, and I'm trying to do 10 projects.\" And no one's going to do a good job that way. So researchers have to learn with their partners about how to say no and focus on the most important things. But that's only half of it, right? That's the research side. \n\n(00:48:51):\nI have two thoughts about what companies should be doing. The first one, it's a little bit of an aside, but not really. One thing I learned by through the responses to the article was everybody came out of the woodworks from the variety of insights disciplines that are out there. Because I come from a tradition of user experience research or user research, but there are many insights disciplines in many industries, and they all wanted to claim one type of research or another, and say, \"Oh, well, we overhear in consumer insights or market research have been doing that well for years.\" And there are many insights disciplines. And generally I think creating silos is stupid. \n\n(00:49:33):\nActually, I'm curious what you think, because here's the number one thing I heard when I joined Airbnb and you were there, is I did it a quick listening tour where I talked to a bunch of product people. And they all said the same thing. They were like, \"Listen, we have all these different people throwing insights over the transom. And it's great. We want to hear from the data scientists, from the product specialists, from the customer service people, and the voice of the customer, whatever, all that stuff. But they're all coming over the side and we don't know what to make of it. It's too much.\"\n\n(00:50:03):\nAnd that, as much as anything, is an argument for companies to stop siloing research disciplines. So when I joined Airbnb, I set out to create an integrated insights function where it's like, \"Let's do UX research, let's talk about the market and competitors when we have to. Let's integrate smartly with data science functions. Let's integrate all the stuff we're getting from customer service feedback.\" We brought over what was then the NPS program and said, \"Hey, if we're getting customer feedback there, let's all just use it all to fuel this one insights machine.\" So that's the first piece of advice I'd give companies.\n\n(00:50:38):\nAnd the second one, without being a broken record, is to think differently about the broken cycle. So integrate researchers into a unified, lean process. So if the researcher is not there from beginning to end, if there are not strong relationships between product people and design people at every level, engineering people at every level, and somebody who's their insights partner, we're going to fall back into this problem where we're just a service discipline,",

And so creating that integrated, lean process where a researcher is arm in arm from the beginning, is the most important advice I'd give.\n\nLenny (00:51:19):\nThat last piece may be the answer to this next question, but the question is how can product managers be better partners to user researchers/get more leverage out of user researchers?\n\nJudd Antin (00:51:31):\nI think that is in many ways the answer, making sure that they are creating a process for the product, for their products, that it integrates user researchers and insights from beginning to end. Also, being willing to partner with the research on the roofless prioritization. I used to say that, \"A full plate for a researcher was probably three things, two big projects and a small project, like a side project. More than that, your researcher is probably not doing a very good job. And a project may take 48 hours. That's okay. But so they need your help to prioritize, they need you to participate. Great PMs will take the time to be with researchers to go into the field, even to travel.\" Did you ever do that, Lenny?\n\nLenny (00:52:15):\nI did. I went with Louise, who introduced, we came up with this, basically told me to chat with you about this topic. \n\nJudd Antin (00:52:23):\nThanks, Louise.\n\nLenny (00:52:24):\nThanks, Louise. We did a whole tour to Paris, our whole team, or the leads of our team went to Paris to do a bunch of focus groups and a bunch of user research behind actual mirrors. I've never done that before that trip, and it was amazing. We learned a ton.\n\nJudd Antin (00:52:38):\nCan I tell you a quick story about behind the mirror? \n\nLenny (00:52:40):\nPlease.\n\nJudd Antin (00:52:41):\nThis is back from when I was at Facebook. And there was the high times there, it was like 2012, '13, and newsfeed is really taking off, ads are going into newsfeed. And I was a leader of a team that was working among other things on how to address post quality. Like, \"How do we think about what's a good post and how do we get feedback about it?\" And so there was a team of engineers that thought, \"One thing that you can do on Facebook is hide a post.\" So they were like, \"This is easy. Let's look at the posts that are hidden the most and use that as the signal of what's a good post on Facebook?\" Seems reasonable. And something tripped me on this one. And so I did two things.\n\n(00:53:26):\nSo the first thing I did is I looked at the distribution of hiding by user, and found out that it's power law distributed, like everything on the internet. There are a few people on Facebook who hide a ton, and then most people don't hide at all. And so then what we did was, we call these super hiders, we called them super hiders. And so we said, \"Let's find super hiders around the office, and we'll get a super hider in, and we'll do a really traditional user interview.\" We just wanted to see. So literally the first person who walked in, I remember, because this was a person who had those fingernails that are so long, you don't know how they can do touchscreens, but they did. They were amazing at it. And it was one of those rooms with the glass. And I insisted that the ENG directors, the product people, and they were willing, whatever.\n\n(00:54:20):\nSo everybody's behind the glass, and I'm there with them, and the excellent researcher is in the room, and they come in, and we're just doing a traditional think aloud study. And so they go, \"Hey, can you open up your Facebook app? We would just love to see what your experience is like.\" So they open up Facebook, and were looking, and they look at the first story, and they hide it. They go to the second story and they hide it. And this went on for a while. \n\n(00:54:43):\nAnd she's definitely using Facebook, but every time she'd finish with a story, she'd hide it. And the people in the back room were starting to chatter. And they're like, \"Wait, what? What is happening right now?\" And like the good researcher that this person was, they let it continue, and they're like, \"Whoa, can you tell me what you're thinking right now?\" Come to find out that she was like, \"Well, I hid that story because I'd seen it already.\" The model she was going for was inbox zero, which was sad, because it was infinitely scrolling. She would never get there. \n\n(00:55:16):\nAnd the reason I liked that story is because the people in the back room had their minds blown. It was not that we assumed that was common behavior, like this person could have been unique, but it was enough, because those people were",

One example just gives you a, \"Wow, this might be exactly what's happening. Let's go validate that.\" Versus, like, \"We are confident, 100%, this is what happened.\" I love that. It reminds me actually in the mirror study that I was talking about in Paris, there's a Facebook element to it, too. We were trying to convince hosts how to feel more comfortable accepting guests who are booking instantly. And one of our theories was if they were connected on Facebook, they would be more comfortable letting someone book instantly. \n\nJudd Antin (00:55:47):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:56:21):\nAnd we're just like, \"Hey, what if you were to connect Facebook and see if they're friends?\" And everybody in Paris was very afraid of connecting and giving Facebook any data, way ahead of what the US hosts were feeling. \n\nJudd Antin (00:56:34):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:56:34):\nSo it just made it very clear nobody wants to actually give Facebook any data. So it was very anti-Facebook at that point.\n\nJudd Antin (00:56:40):\nYeah, that's so interesting. Germany and France were always our bellwethers for what the rest of the world would be thinking with data privacy concerns.\n\nLenny (00:56:49):\nOh, man. Okay, a couple more things. A lot of this started with a lot of layoffs within user research. And I think between the lines, there's a sense of teams don't need as many researchers as they hired during the ZIRP era. I think a question in everyone's mind is just like, \"How many researchers do we need? What is a good ratio?\" I imagine there's not a simple answer, here, but just what's your general advice to companies of how many researchers is it right?\n\nJudd Antin (00:57:15):\nThis is a thing I've thought a lot about, especially in my role as the head of the design studio, that was my fundamental question. It's like, \"You have all these writers, designers, researchers, how do you structure them, how many, and where, and who works on what?\" And the organizing principle for me was always relationships. You know you have enough when the people who need to have a concept research partner have them. And I would much rather create pain in that situation than spread someone too thinly. So my advice was always like, \"Don't try to create a researcher to cover this entire product space. Pair a researcher up with somebody who's going to involve them in a consistent, engaged process, and let them go to work, and see the impact they're going to have, but protect their time. And then other people are like, \"Wait a second, that person's doing great work. I want some of that.\"\n\n(00:58:02):\nAnd creating that pain for them, because it's a pain of loss, is the number one way to grow headcount. That's how I always approached getting more headcount, was not arguing abstractly for why research is important, but by asking partners who wish they had it, to do the arguing for me. And so you're right, there isn't a clean answer for like, \"Hey, this is the right ratio,\" because it really depends on the nature of the product. Like, \"Is it a early stage product? Is it a late stage product? Are we talking about a startup or a late stage company?\" But I would argue there's always room for a researcher. Lenny, I'll tell you, and I used this in a keynote talk I gave lately. You published recently a list of, I think it was about 20 B2B companies and their first 10 employees. Do you remember doing that?\n\nLenny (00:58:51):\nAbsolutely.\n\nJudd Antin (00:58:52):\nDo you remember how many researchers are anywhere on that list? I'll give you a hint.\n\nLenny (00:58:57):\nNot too many.\n\nJudd Antin (00:58:57):\nIt's between zero and two. It's one. There's one researcher on that list, anywhere. Anywhere. And that's messed up to me. Now, look, it's just these 20 companies, and each is in their own space, so I'm not going to overgeneralize. But a researcher can drive incredible value no matter what stage a company is at, because a good researcher makes you go faster, not slower, and they drive impact because they answer questions which are impossible to answer in any other way. That's true if you're a startup. It's true if you're a late stage company. Now, if it's your first 10 employees, one researcher is going to go a long way. As you grow, making sure that you're matching up researchers so that they have strong partners in the key parts of the business is the best way to figure out if you have enough.\n\nLenny (00:59:45):\nInteresting. So",

As you grow, making sure that you're matching up researchers so that they have strong partners in the key parts of the business is the best way to figure out if you have enough.\n\nLenny (00:59:45):\nInteresting. So your advice is, as you're starting a company, your pitch is that you'll have a lot more leverage and move faster hiring a researcher versus generally an engineers, but you'd be trading off, essentially. That's what most of the hires end up being.\n\nJudd Antin (00:59:58):\nI am reluctant to overgeneralize, and I would say I know many founders who are in startup mode are like, \"I know what I need to build. The problem is that I need people who can help me execute.\" And I think that's right. And so everything's a trade off. But remember, imagine that you could have that Swiss army knife at your disposal. Maybe you've got an MVP out the door, and you're looking to make your first major iteration, or like many startups, you need to pivot. This is where it's like, \"Hey, you don't have to do that alone.\" We deify startup founders who pivot appropriately, but I think that is what we would might call moral luck, where we deify the ones who got it right, and even though they made exactly the same decisions as the one who got them wrong. \n\n(01:00:46):\nAnd the fact of the matter is, if you have an insights person with you who has that Swiss army knife of tools, you're not in it alone. You don't have to guess. Ultimately, it will still come down to a tough decision that you and founders have to make, but you can have evidence that bears on that decision, which you wouldn't be able to get any other way.\n\nLenny (01:01:05):\nTo close out on this, and I have just a couple more questions on this thread, I think one of your big messages to researchers is, \"You can be empowered. It's up to you to do the right sort of research and to move your career in the right direction, not become a researcher people don't need.\" And there's this quote that you have at the top of your post, where a lot of the reaction, or I guess the way you put it is, \"I know what you're thinking, they just don't get it. We're so misunderstood. Our plight is to deliver insights that users use to drive business value while we're forgotten, never driving the roadmap, no seat at the table, consistently miscast, only to be laid off in the end.\" And what I'm hearing from you is like, \"You can change that. You can push back on doing research that isn't actually contributing.\" But let me ask you, what's your lasting, I don't know, advice you would leave researchers with to be successful?\n\nJudd Antin (01:01:56):\nYeah, it's tough to be operating in a broken system, and so I feel that response, where you feel kind of powerless, but I think that's not likely to lead us past this moment to the next evolution of research. So that's where it's like I don't blame any researcher at all for being in the spot they're in. It's been a tough go. However, crying about our lot is not going to get us anywhere. So I think the point of the article for me, and this is advice I give companies all the time when I do consulting with them, is like, \"Hey, we can set this up in a different way, which responds to the current environment in a way which will drive a huge amount of impact.\" Now, that takes companies making the right choices. It also takes researchers owning up and developing skills, pushing back, understanding what research can have the most value, developing the skills, and the knowledge, and language around the business, becoming more influential, being excellent communicators.\n\n(01:02:55):\nIt's one of the things I would evaluate the most in hiring, especially research leaders, because I needed them to show and teach by example, is like isn't just rigorous research. It's like if a tree fell in the forest and no one was there to hear it, you need to communicate it effectively, and you need to do it in a way that's appropriate to the audience. Because If I'm talking to you, Lenny, it's different than I'm talking to Brian Chesky at Airbnb. And so I got to be able to give that presentation effectively, and get right to the heart of it, and speak the right language. And so if you're a researcher, it's not hopeless. Actually the discipline, the future is so bright, and we can help it along by continuing to develop these different skills as companies build a model that's more inclusive.\n\nLenny (01:03:38):\nAwesome. Okay. I have one just random, tangential question about NPS. You have strong opinions about NPS, and I just wanted to hear your perspective on the value of NPS, your experience with NPS. \n\nJudd Antin (01:03:50):\nYeah. I do have a strong opinion about NPS. I like to say, \"NPS is the best example of the marketing industry marketing itself.\" And the problem is this threatens many people's livelihoods, because there's an entire industry of consultants and software providers that want you to believe NPS is a useful and accurate metric. The problem is, the consensus in the survey science community is that NPS makes all the mistakes. So it's a garbage in, garbage out problem. So the likelihood to recommend question is bad for a whole variety of reasons. So it's bad because",

The problem is, the consensus in the survey science community is that NPS makes all the mistakes. So it's a garbage in, garbage out problem. So the likelihood to recommend question is bad for a whole variety of reasons. So it's bad because it's a zero to 11 scale. It's bad because it's usually unlabeled. So we label the polls, but that's not the gold standard for research. It's bad because it's 11 items. \n\n(01:04:37):\nAnd there's a couple of problems with that. Number one, we find that precision goes down after five items on average, maybe seven. Number two, especially on mobile, if you're taking this survey, what percentage of those options are below the fold? We are not going to get accurate survey data. And so from a survey perspective, it's really bad. There's also this intuition, which is like, \"How likely are you to recommend Windows 11 to your friends and family?\" I am not a person who goes around recommending operating systems. The question is fundamentally flawed. \n\n(01:05:11):\nThe argument is that that question is a good indicator of loyalty, but there's a really simple solution, Lenny. Customer satisfaction, a simple CSAT metric, is better. It has better data properties, it is more precise, it is more correlated to business outcomes. I wanted to prove this. This is something that survey scientists know and marketers don't want you to know. And so we did the work with Mike Murakami, who led survey science at Airbnb, and he's still there, great researcher. And we basically redid all that work to find out if all that stuff was true just for Airbnb. And it is. It's simple. Don't ask NPS, ask customer satisfaction\n\nLenny (01:05:50):\nAnd the customer satisfaction question, what's the actual question for people to make sure?\n\nJudd Antin (01:05:54):\nOverall, how satisfied are you with your experience with Airbnb? Or it could be some version of that, which is like, \"Overall, how satisfied are you with your experience with customer service when you had a problem?\" So there could be a more specific version of that question, but those questions have better properties. And a lot of people say, \"Well, hey, everybody's using NPS. So at least it gives me a benchmark because I can compare my NPS to industry NPS.\" The problem with that is the research shows that NPS is idiosyncratic, so it goes up and downs in ways that we don't understand, and there's a lot of inconsistency in how it's asked, that creates variations in the data, which means it's not apples to apples, so you can't even compare your NPS meaningfully to somebody else's.\n\nLenny (01:06:37):\nI love these hot takes. I'm curious to see who comes out of the woodwork, too, when-\n\nJudd Antin (01:06:41):\nPeople are going to be so mad, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:06:42):\nI love that. I think, yeah, I've heard this many times and people don't talk about it. Okay. Is there anything else you want to share or leave people with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nJudd Antin (01:06:54):\nCan I? Yeah, I want to add one thing if I could, because this has come up on your podcast a few times recently, which is about the idea of people doing their own product walkthroughs. So should a PM just rely on their own dog fooding of the product and their own walkthrough to figure out how to fix it? And a couple of times recently this has come up, and I think the consensus seems to be, \"Yes, this is a good thing.\" And I have a contrarian opinion there, too, which is that I think it is really important for everyone to dog food their own products. The problem is related to relying on your intuition about those products, which is the thing most PMs have trouble with is realizing, \"You are nothing like the user. You are nothing like them in ways that will bias the way you think about what's good and bad in your product in ways that you can't necessarily recognize. Some things with a product, some problems with a product, you need a pulse to recognize.\"\n\n(01:07:57):\nAnd most good PMs that I know have a pulse and so cool. But a lot of them require context of use, priorities, constraints that you just don't have and you can't imagine purely on the basis of your own usage. So what I think that means is that you should definitely dog food your own product. Doing product walkthroughs to identify lists of potential issues is a great thing to do. Prioritizing that list, figuring out which ones are more or less a problem, and for whom is an area where you should be extremely wary of relying on your own opinion, expertise, or intuition when you are dog fooding your own product.\n\nLenny (01:08:39):\nThank you for sharing that. It's definitely come up a bunch on this podcast, so I think that's an important lesson for people to take away. Anything else before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nJudd Antin (01:08:49):\nI appreciate you, Lenny. Thanks for having me on. \n\nLenny (01:08:51):\nI appreciate you, Judd.

Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nJudd Antin (01:08:56):\nI am ready.\n\nLenny (01:08:57):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJudd Antin (01:09:02):\nI recently read a business book by Barbara Kellerman called Bad Leadership. And what I love about it is that we spend a lot of time talking about good leaders, and she really dives into the worst leaders and what makes them bad leaders in a way that I think is really valuable for everybody. \n\n(01:09:19):\nI'd also recommend, I read a lot of fiction, so two recommendations, there. One, a recent Pulitzer Prize winner, Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver. It's an outstanding read that also is really sad, and moving, and illustrative, especially if you want to understand rural poverty. And then completely other side of the fiction spectrum, if you're interested in science fiction, which I am, read the Murderbot Diaries, it's about a sarcastic killer robot. And who doesn't love them?\n\nLenny (01:09:48):\nI love these fiction recommendations. I feel like we need more of these on the podcast, so thank you. \n\nJudd Antin (01:09:52):\nYeah. Everybody goes to business books.\n\nLenny (01:09:53):\nYeah, absolutely. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nJudd Antin (01:09:59):\nWe recently watched The Last of Us and it blew our mind. I watched it after I played the video game after long last, if you are a person who plays video games and you haven't played The Last of Us, play it. If you don't know, the show is based on the video game, not the other way around.\n\nLenny (01:10:14):\nDo you have a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?\n\nJudd Antin (01:10:19):\nThink of a topic that you had to explain lately that was the most complex, and then explain it to me like I'm five. And there are a lot of ways to vary that question, but the reason I like it is because I think, and I've asked this question to VP and C-suite candidates in multiple disciplines, and sometimes it's related to a conversation, like I might ask them to explain something complicated about quantum computing, or music theory, or it could be a complex business decision, but I want to see if somebody can break a complex problem down in a really simple way, and give me an intuition for it in a short amount of time. I think that is a differentiator between good and great for many people.\n\nLenny (01:11:02):\nDo you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like?\n\nJudd Antin (01:11:06):\nYeah, this is a really weird one, but my whole family started indoor rock climbing recently, and there's a challenge you have when you top rope, which is that you're looking up all the time. So they make these glasses, which are called belay glasses, and they have an angled mirror embedded in the lens, so that you can look straight ahead, and the view you see is up towards the person who you're belaying. And I just thought that product is so perfect for that. That's a niche problem and there isn't a better way to solve it.\n\nLenny (01:11:37):\nDo you have a favorite motto that you often come back to, that you share with friends either in work or in life that you find useful?\n\nJudd Antin (01:11:44):\nYeah. This is going to seem like pandering, Lenny, but I don't know if you remember a conversation that you and I had, it must've been eight years ago. I remember where we were sitting. And it was about stoicism. Do you remember this? Anyway, we had this conversation.\n\nLenny (01:11:59):\nI don't, but I was into stoicism for a while.\n\nJudd Antin (01:12:01):\nI know you were, because we talked about it. And so the motto comes from stoicism, which is basically, \"Focus on the things you can control and ignore the rest.\" And a lot of people think of this as the serenity prayer or the serenity saying, that was a 20th century invention, but Epictetus was writing about this BC, and I think about it all the time. So much of the stress, and pain, and worry that we have in life comes from things we can't control. So I try to let those things go.\n\nLenny (01:12:34):\nAmazing. I learned that lesson from 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, and just the importance of thinking about these circles of you can control, you can influence, and you have no control over, and there's no reason to think about those other things.\n\nJudd Antin (01:12:46):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny (01:12:47):\nJudd, this was everything I hoped it would be. We got into some really good stuff. I'm excited to hear how people react.

So juddantin.com is the place to find out. I also write. I write a medium post that you can find at onebigthought.com. And you'll find a lot of the topics we talked about today, including the original post that started this at onebigthought.com. If there's one thing I could ask your listeners to do is to get next to your researcher. I just think if you build those relationships and involve a researcher and insights person early and often, beautiful things will happen for you and for the business. So that's the thing everyone can do for me.\n\nLenny (01:13:56):\nI love that. I've always done that. I loved my researchers that I've worked with, many of them reporting to you, and so beautiful takeaway. Judd, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJudd Antin (01:14:07):\nLenny, thank you.

Folks who were building for those industries kind of saw their market grow and grow and grow basically steadily year over year as the number of people with mobile phones increased, right, as the number of people connected to the internet increase. One of the things which is already I'd say different in AI, is just how explosive the technology can be. There's no weight on hardware distribution. It means that the space is just growing so exponentially.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):\nHow is the act of being an engineer and building changing?\n\nScott Wu (00:01:05):\nI think there's going to be way more programmers and way more engineers a few years from now. Pretty quickly. The form factor of what it means to be a programmer obviously is going to change, but at the end of the day, of course the discipline is all about just being able to tell your computer what's do. And so in that lens, I really think that programming is only going to become more and more important as AI gets more powerful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:20):\nToday my guest is Scott Wu. Scott is the co-founder and CEO of Cognition, which makes a product called Devin, the world's first autonomous AI software engineer. Unlike other AI tools that I've highlighted on this podcast, Devin is designed to act like an actual remote engineer that you chat with like you would with any other human engineer through Slack or through its dedicated website. When Devin launched about a year ago, it was very much a junior engineer. Over the past year, they've made a lot of progress and Devin is now being used by tons of companies in production. We chatted about how their engineering team of 15 uses Devins to build Devin, including how every engineer uses about five Devins each to help them code and move faster. How a quarter of their pull requests today are committed by Devins and that they expect this to be over 50% by the end of the year.\n\n(00:02:05):\nWe also talk about how Scott imagines software engineering is going to look in the future and how the role of an engineer changes from a coder to an architect. We also get into the eight pivots that they went through before landing on this path, why Scott believes AI tools like this will lead to more engineer hiring versus less. Also where the name Devin comes from and so much more. This episode is going to blow your mind. I highly recommend you listen to it if you're at all interested about where engineering, product building, and AI is going.

Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:17):\nSo integrations have become a big deal for AI products. Why is that?\n\nBrandon Foo (00:04:21):\nIntegrations are mission-critical for AI for two reasons. First, AI products need contacts from their customer's business data such as Google Drive files, Slack messages or CRM records. Second, for AI products to automate work on behalf of users, AI agents need to be able to take action across these different third-party tools.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:40):\nSo where does Paragon fit into all this?\n\nBrandon Foo (00:04:42):\nWell, these integrations are a pain to build and that's why Paragon provides an embedded platform that enables engineers to ship these product integrations in just days instead of months across every use case from RAG data ingestion to agentic actions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):\nAnd I know from firsthand experience that maintenance is even harder than just building it for the first time.\n\nBrandon Foo (00:05:01):\nExactly. We believe product teams should focus engineering efforts and competitive advantages, not integrations. That's why companies like You.com, AI21 and hundreds of others use Paragon to accelerate their integration strategy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:15):\nIf you want to avoid wasting months of engineering on integrations that your customers need, check out paragon@useparagon.com/lenny. Scott, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nScott Wu (00:05:29):\nThanks so much for having me. Excited to be on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:31):\nI'm really excited to have you here because you are building and you've been building something that is very different from what a lot of other AI companies have been doing for a long time, although they are starting to converge to where you guys are now. We're going to talk about that and it's also just such a unique point in the history of AI and just the journey of AI. And so it's really cool to be chatting right now. And I feel like we're going to chat again in a few years and be like, wow, we were so right about so much and so wrong about so much.\n\nScott Wu (00:05:59):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:00):\nAnd so I'm excited to have you here. Let's start with talking about Devin, giving people an understanding of just what the heck Devin is, is the main product that you guys build. What is the simplest way to understand what is Devin?\n\nScott Wu (00:06:10):\nAbsolutely. And so Devin is a fully autonomous software engineer that is going to work on tasks end to end, and so there are a lot of great tools for all parts of the stack of the AI code workflow. What Devin does is it is a full asynchronous workflow, and so you can tag Devin on an issue in Slack, you're talking about an issue and you tag Devin, you can tag Devin in Linear, you can have Devin and Devin will make pull requests in your GitHub, and so it's very much built to work with engineering teams as your junior engineer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:38):\nAmazing, okay. So I remember when you guys launched this, there was this big pitch of this is your new AI engineer and it was really good at a lot of stuff. It wasn't great at other things. It's been a year now about since you guys launched, is that right?\n\nScott Wu (00:06:50):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:51):\nWhat's the best way to think about the level of seniority that engineer had back in the day when you guys launched and then the level of seniority of engineer today if that's, I don't know, measure of how to think about Devin?\n\nScott Wu (00:07:02):\nYeah, and it's crazy to think about by the way, because a year ago when we did the initial launch, I mean people didn't really believe that an agent was possible. Right. And it was, I mean, it was a very different time. So like start of 2024, things with model capabilities were definitely quite a bit earlier on, reasoning especially was quite a bit earlier on. And yeah, I mean, in the time since then it's obviously developed a lot. I think in terms of practical skills, there's some comparisons we make. Sometimes we kind of say, well, when we got started it was kind of like a high school CS student and then as time went on, it became more of a college intern and now it's like a junior engineer. But I would say though that those are more rough guidelines because I really like the phrase jagged intelligence for example, because obviously there are certain things that it is much better at than a human. There are certain things that it's much worse at than a human.\n\n(00:07:52):\nAnd I think over the last year we've learned a lot especially about not just coding agents but agents in general just really building out how all of us should be working and interacting with agents as part of our flow. And so a lot of the things that we built, I mean, there was no Slack, there was no GitHub integration, there was no Linear, there was no interactive planning phase working back and forth.",

And so a lot of the things that we built, I mean, there was no Slack, there was no GitHub integration, there was no Linear, there was no interactive planning phase working back and forth. There was no way to touch up Devin's code. And so a lot of the features that we've built on the product side since then have really been about basically yeah, figuring out how to make working with Devin and handing off tasks to Devin as smooth of an experience as possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:27):\nThat's so interesting. So a lot of the work has gone not into how do we just make Devin the best possible engineer, but it's how to work with this new type of entity that we haven't ever worked with.\n\nScott Wu (00:08:37):\nI think it's a 50/50 of both. I think the capabilities obviously have improved a ton and we've seen these get better and get measurably better. But I think the other side of it is everything to do with yeah, really the product interface and the tools and so on. And I think today folks generally know how to use chatbots and to with chatbots, right, and that's an interface that people are familiar with and obviously with agents it's still like a real curve, I think to learn how to use them and how to get the most out of them. And so it's really exciting to see a lot of others starting to build and do a lot more in the agent space as well. But I think this is the kind of thing that we're all really figuring out together as a space.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:15):\nWhat can you share about just the scale of Devin at this point, whatever you're comfortable sharing, and then just where do you think the level of Devin's coding abilities will be in a year?\n\nScott Wu (00:09:24):\nSo we work with companies of all stages and sizes. On the smallest end, it goes to startups of just one or two people who are using Devin to build out a lot of their kind of initial prototype or initial product all the way up to big public companies, Fortune 100 companies or public banks or things like that who are using Devin across their engineering teams. In general, we've seen a huge range of the use cases there. And obviously the kinds of engineering work that you're doing at a one or two person startup, they're very different from the kind of work that you're doing at a public bank.\n\n(00:09:55):\nBut throughout it's all been basically yeah, being that junior buddy of yours that makes you go faster and really multiplies you, I would say. I think it can multiply you as an engineer obviously by just letting you work with your own team of Devins instead of having to be kind of fully synchronous on a single task. And then it's also kind of multiplying your team and multiplying your team's knowledge base because Devin really accumulates a lot of the knowledge from working with every member of your team and is able to bring that into each new session.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:23):\nAwesome. We're going to show people how it actually works later in the podcast. We're going to do a few live demos, but let's actually go to the beginning of the journey. What's just the origin story of Devin? How did this all begin?\n\nScott Wu (00:10:33):\nThe founding team, I mean most of us have known each other for years and years and years actually. And for almost everyone, this is our first time working together, but we've known each other a long time. And we all actually had our own kind of journeys in AI for the last decade or so. And so for myself, I ran a company before this called Lunchclub, which was an AI for a professional networking product and I ran that for about five years. And one of my co-founders, Steven was one of the first engineers at a company called Scale AI, which has obviously grown a lot and done very well. My other co-founder Walden, was an early engineer at a company called Cursor, which has also obviously grown a lot and done really well. And our whole team was kind of like that. Many of us knew each other from competitive programming and math competitions, but we had stayed very closely in touch in the decade since then and we've all kind of all had our own journeys.\n\n(00:11:22):\nAnd so we had one person who was running teams at Neuro, we had one person who was at Waymo, someone who had their own YC tools startup for machine learning, and we were really excited to build something together. And this was around late 2023, so about a year and a half ago at this point. And yeah, when we got started, I mean I think there were a couple of things that we felt really strongly about and one was that reinforcement learning was really working and was going to be the next big paradigm shift in capabilities. Back then it was the initial ChatGPT launch in 2022, and those models were, to first order were what we would call imitation learning in AI, right, which is basically you have the model read all the texts that you can find on the internet and then train it to talk like somebody on the internet would talk. Right. And there are kind of obviously a lot more details on top of that, but that's kind of the first order pass of what was really done.\n\n(00:12:16):\nAnd it was amazing. Right. I mean, it passed the churn test, it was able",

I mean, it passed the churn test, it was able to respond and to have encyclopedic knowledge about a lot of things. And I think this new paradigm which we've gotten into over this last year or year and a half is really high compute RL, which is a very different paradigm, right, which is basically the ability to go and do work on task and put something together and then be evaluated on whether that was correct or incorrect and use that knowledge to decide what to do and to learn from that. Right. And so we felt very strongly that that was going to happen. I think for us, code was the natural thing to work on for a couple reasons. One, because we're all programmer nerds ourselves, and so teaching AI to code is about as cool as it gets for us, but also because code has this whole automated feedback loop, right, where you can run the code and that is the kind of automated feedback that really feeds into the RL, which makes these models so great at coding.\n\n(00:13:06):\nAnd then the other thing that we felt very strongly about was that the product experience was going to shift from what I'll call text completion to agents basically. Right. And to first order, I would kind of say there's been a lot of great experiences in text completion. It's been used for marketing, it's been used for customer support, it's been used for education and in Coda obviously as well. The GitHub copilot was kind of really the dominant product of that initial wave. Right.\n\n(00:13:34):\nBut I think that the big shift that we really felt we would see is moving from kind of this text to text model to an actual autonomous system that can make decisions, that can interact with the real world, that can take in feedback, that can iterate and take multiple steps to solve problems. And now we call that agents, but that was what we were really excited about at the time. So it was always coding, it was always agents. And in some ways that kind of feels like it should have been cleared from the start. But even with that, I feel like we've pivoted eight times or something within coding agents over the last year and a half, so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:08):\nI just noticed recently all the AI, top AI companies sort of, not all, but many of them, the product that is winning is different, has a different name from the company, which is not typical, Cursors, Anysphere, Bolt, StackBlitz, you guys are Cognition Labs, like V0 is Vercel. And it just tells me these all emerge later in the company's journey and they tried a bunch of stuff and like, oh wow, this thing worked and it's so interesting that it's so common amongst these top AI companies.\n\nScott Wu (00:14:34):\nYeah, and there's even, I mean OpenAI, ChatGPT, Anthropic and Claude and Google. Yeah, it's funny. Yeah, yeah, I agree. So when we got started, it wasn't even really a company. I mean, it was more like a project or a hackathon almost. We got a bunch, we booked an Airbnb basically for a couple of weeks. This was around Thanksgiving time and just got a bunch of people together who were just excited to hack on some projects and build something cool. And it's funny, actually the first thing that we were building for actually was more solving these more contest programming problems and using an agentic loop to really do better on that. And so obviously if you run your code on the test cases, you can evaluate, there's a lot of agentic work that you can do there to try and do better, and that we spent some time on that initially. And then we've kind of gone from, I mean the story of the whole company for us in some sense has been going from hacker house to hacker house.\n\n(00:15:26):\nSo after that we had another hacker house and that's where kind of some of the initial ideas for Devin came and really building a software engineering agent and not just a coding agent and having to interact with a lot of these tools, but even then there were so many iterations. And even the idea of talking to Devin for example was like, it was something that we had to come up with. Right. Initially, it was just like you hand off a task and then it works and then it shows you this whole finished code. Right. And now obviously it's like you can jump in at any time, you can get feedback on the plan, you guys can scope out the task together when you're working with Devin. And a lot of these things we had to develop obviously, and certainly we've learned a lot about the use cases, the form factor. We've made a lot of big improvements and step function improvements on the capabilities and Devin's ability to use tools and to bug and make decisions.\n\n(00:16:11):\nAnd so it's yeah, it's been a fun journey. I mean, I think I would say that the grounding question for us really, which is one that we think about all the time, is really just what is the future of software engineering and how should we be working with AI to write code? Because I think at the end of the day, of course that's what underlines all of the product decisions that we make, so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:",

Because I think at the end of the day, of course that's what underlines all of the product decisions that we make, so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:34):\nI like that you're asking the juicy question I wanted to get to. Before I ask it just for the history books, when did you guys start kind of hacking around and when did Devin launch? How long was that period?\n\nScott Wu (00:16:45):\nYeah, so we started in November of 2023, which was then yeah, just like hackathon mode. We officially made it into a company around the start of 2024, and then our initial launch was in March. And so it was like nonstop, I mean it's been nonstop for the entire last 17 months, but it's getting to the launch and then obviously working with enterprises and developing the product a lot more, building it and getting it to work for a lot of practical use cases and then making it fully available self-serve in December of last year. And now we've rolled out 2.0 obviously just a few weeks ago. And so it's been a very busy time for us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:25):\nUnderstatement of the century. Let me ask this question because you touched on it a bit, this whole idea of Devin as a person and this idea of creating a personality for Devin. It's unlike any other, I believe, AI app. No one else has a name and you don't think of it as a person. What made you guys decide to go that approach and just how do you design it to work well that way?\n\nScott Wu (00:17:44):\nI would say it's a decision we're pretty proud of, I would say. I mean, I think there's a lot of different product experiences out there, and I think the thing that really makes Devin unique in what it does is that you can really hand off and more and more what we've seen honestly is that I think a lot of kind of explaining the Devin experience to folks is really just explain it as, yeah, this is your junior buddy. And that goes for a lot of the parts of the flow where in the onboarding for example, initially I would say we've definitely had a lot of users come in and just kind of see the blank screen and not really know, or they'd ask, \"Hey, I'm going to do this whole big re-architecture, the whole code base.\"\n\n(00:18:21):\nAnd basically what we've learned over time is to basically get folks to think more like whoa, whoa, whoa, let's work on getting the repository set up first. Let's make sure we hand Devin a couple one pointer tasks so it can get familiar with the code base. Let's get it the thing. If Devin needs to be able to test the code or run the linter or CI or things like that. Obviously we want to make sure Devin's got its own virtual machine set up to be able to do that.\n\n(00:18:45):\nAnd similarly, I think the usage pattern, I think often it wasn't clear and obviously you can sit and just kind of watch Devin do it action by action and work that way, but we found that the best workflow really as a team building a lot of stuff was to work with multiple Devins and to run them asynchronously and to kick them off and to only jump in basically as you needed to provide feedback or steer the plan or anything like that. And so in many ways, I think Devin as a name really is our attempt to kind of capture the soul of that as a product where it really is treating it like a bit more of an autonomous entity that you can hand off tasks, that you can work with, that you should be teaching and learning with over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:29):\nI want to come back to an area you started us down and then I took us away from which is impact on software engineering and how software engineering is going to change. So there's kind of two parts to this. Just like when people are using Devin today, say this year, how is the act of being an engineer and building changing for those companies? What does that look like?\n\nScott Wu (00:19:49):\nBy the way, we're all software engineers ourselves. It's like I'm a programmer by training and still a programmer at heart certainly. And I think the way that we've always thought about it is there's layers of abstraction and there's tools, and one way I would say it at a high level is kind of I think of AI in general as, yeah, I mean computers are obviously getting more and more intelligence and are able to do more and more and it's possible there may come a day where computers truly do everything that we do and humans are not responsible for any of it.\n\n(00:20:20):\nI don't expect that to come particularly soon, but I guess what I would say is until that point, for as long as we're still part of the equation, one of the most important things to do obviously is for us as humans is to instruct our computers on what we want and what we want to build and what we want to do. Right. And software engineering is, we think of it today obviously as Python and C++ and JavaScript and all these things, but at the end of the day, of course the discipline is all about just being to tell your computer what to do. And so in that lens, I really think that programming is, if anything, is only going to become more and",

And so in that lens, I really think that programming is, if anything, is only going to become more and more important as AI gets more powerful. And I think the thing that's really exciting for us is yeah, it's really seeing that kind of iterative transformation. And so you ask what things look like today, and I would say, yeah, it really is like having a junior buddy or really a team of junior buddies that you can work with. Right.\n\n(00:21:12):\nAnd so every engineer on our team, we use a ton of Devin when we're building Devin, and so Devin merges several hundred pull requests into production in the Devin code bases every month, which is, I mean, our whole team is only 15 engineers, and so it's a pretty sizable fraction of all the code that we write. And the way that we use it is basically, yeah, everyone's got their whole team of Devins. If you're going to be looking through various issues, if you're going through feature requests, if you're going through bugs, if you're going through new paradigms that you want to build, then it is naturally the case that there's a lot of handoff points where you just say, \"Hey, at Devin, here's what's going on. Can you please take a pass at this?\" Right.\n\n(00:21:47):\nAnd sometimes Devin will be able to do the task 100% autonomously and just makes the PR and then you merge the PR and that's great. Sometimes you want to be able to jump in for the 10 or 20% that really needs your help. Maybe there's a few details with how exactly you want to scope it or how you're architecting this feature, or maybe you want to go and test the front end at the end yourself to make sure it looks exactly the way that you want and give your one or two lines of feedback after that. Right. But a lot of it is really yeah, is kind of like yeah, learning to work with Devin to be able to just do more in parallel and build more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:20):\nWhat percentage of your PRs are Devin versus humans right now?\n\nScott Wu (00:22:25):\nYeah, I'd have to look, but it's in the neighborhood of a quarter or so of all of our-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:30):\nWow.\n\nScott Wu (00:22:31):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:33):\nAnd then what was it like six months ago?\n\nScott Wu (00:22:35):\nOh yeah, it's grown a ton for, I mean, we've seen it grown exponentially internally ourselves as well. And so it's kind of an interesting one where again, it's always both the capabilities and the product interface. And so I think the intelligence has increased a lot. But the other thing of course is that we've spent a lot of time in figuring out how to build and to really kind of build for an interface where you can get Devin's value on tasks where Devin is able to do the 80 or 90%. And so Devin is obviously not perfect and it'll make mistakes and so on. And a lot of the question is basically, yeah, how do you scope out your initial task with Devin and then just kind of set Devin off and have it go and do the things that you want do? How do you come in at the end and review and give feedback? How do you make sure Devin learns over time? How are you able to kind of just check in as needed and course correct if you want to?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:24):\nOkay, so today about quarter of your PRs are Devins. Where do you think this will be at the end of the year? What would you guess?\n\nScott Wu (00:23:31):\nI think by the end of this year, we expect it to be more than half. And I mean, as time goes on, one of the things that we've seen is just you're able to do more and more and more work asynchronously. Right. And you're able to hand off more and more. I think the soul of programming, the soul of software engineering has really been about through all the areas, not just now, but even when it was assembly, right, and even when it was Pascal and even when it was punch cards or whatever, I think the soul of it has really been basically just about defining the problem that you're facing and really thinking through exactly...\n\nScott Wu (00:24:00):\n... about defining the problem that you're facing and really thinking through exactly what is the solution that you want to build. Thinking through the architecture, thinking through the details, and really mapping out in your mind exactly what you want to build basically and what you want to have your computer do. I think that's what makes software engineering really great and I think that's the funnest part of software engineering. \n\n(00:24:21):\nI think, at the same time, that's probably in the neighborhood of 10% of the average software engineer's time, right? Because 90% of the time is you've got this Kubernetes error, then you've got to debug, and you have to see what went wrong and the system crash, or you left some port open and this is messing up, or there's a bug report that you have to take care of, or you've got to migrate your code, or you got it",

A lot more implementation. \n\n(00:24:48):\nOne of the ways that we've kind of thought about Devin in building Devin is really allowing engineers to go from bricklayer to architect, so to speak. A lot of it is just getting to the point where you can do the high-level directing and you can basically specify things exactly how you want. I think it's very much about still having the human in control and having the human able to do the full specification, but just multiplying the magnitude of what you can do and what you can build in one day or one hour or however long.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:18):\nIn the future, say someone is trying to get into software engineering, thinking about becoming an engineer, first of all, do you think people should... Classic question everyone's getting these days. Should you still learn to code? \n\nScott Wu (00:25:29):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:30):\nI'd love your perspective there. And then two, for people that are engineers today, what skills do you think will be more and more important and then less important in this discussion of moving from bricklayer to architect? \n\nScott Wu (00:25:41):\nYeah, for sure. I love this question. First of all, the question of whether you should still learn to code, my answer would be absolutely yes. I think, to a large extent, when you take computer science classes and when you learn these fundamentals, sure you're learning a little bit about how a particular language is, syntax works or something like that. But honestly, most of what you're learning really is about the ability to logically break down problems for number one. And two, I would say is just the model of a computer and a lot of these decisions and a lot of the abstractions that we've built over time. \n\n(00:26:11):\nWhat is a database and how should you think about a database? What is a garbage collection system and how do those work and all of these different pieces? The reason I think that's important is because it's the same with a lot of these other... Arguably we've already gone through these phases in programming and I think this next one is going to be somewhat faster and somewhat bigger, but in many ways a similar flavor, which is when you work with Python today, obviously, a lot of things are already abstracted away from you.\n\n(00:26:38):\nIn some sense, someone from 50 years ago might already call Python. You just get to explain in English what you want and now the computer does it for you. That's great and I think it's really powerful. It's opened it up. I mean, we have far more programmers, obviously, than we ever have before because of that, but I would say certainly as you're building your skills as an engineer, it really helps a lot to understand the abstractions and to be able to peel the layers beneath. Folks will use assembly for example if they're really performance optimizing a piece of code, but also in order to build good systems and to understand these things, you certainly want to understand these abstractions of how does networking work. \n\n(00:27:18):\nWhat is TCP/IP like exactly or what happens with this Python code when it gets interpreted or all of these details. Similarly, I think we will get to a state where, with no experience at all, you're going to be able to build some pretty cool stuff and to do some pretty amazing work just by explaining what it is that you want. But I think that, for quite some time, you really want to be able to think precisely about the details, to peel back the abstractions, to be very precise about what it is that you want to build and how.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:48):\nAnd then for skills that you think are more and more valuable for engineers, where should engineers today be leaning more and more into versus like, \"Forget this. I don't need to think about this anymore\"?\n\nScott Wu (00:28:00):\nFor sure. I think architect... I mean, we already have a term for architect and engineering and I think it is directionally the right term. It's, I think, one thing to just do a routine implementation and write boilerplate code and things like that. I would say that, in many ways, AI coding has already made us much faster at that, but I think a lot of the core questions of understanding very complex systems and working in the context of the whole company and thinking about the product that you're building or the work that you're doing and understanding, \"Okay, what are the problems that we want to solve? How do we want to solve those problems? What is exactly the solution that we want to build? What are all of these key decisions and trade-offs that we're going to be making?\"\n\n(00:28:40):\nBasically, I think folks who are able to do that really, really well are just going to be able to leverage themselves more and more. If anything, I think there's going to be way more programmers and way more engineers a few years from now than there are today. I think pretty quickly the form factor of what it means to be a programmer, obviously, is going to change. And in some sense, it",

If anything, I think there's going to be way more programmers and way more engineers a few years from now than there are today. I think pretty quickly the form factor of what it means to be a programmer, obviously, is going to change. And in some sense, it already has, but I think there's just going to be so much more for us to build. Folks talk about Jevons Paradox all the time. I mean, software is truly the shining example of Jevons Paradox, where we have always managed as a society to find more and more things that we want to build software for and build more code for. I really think there's a lot more out there to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:23):\nFor people that don't know Jevons Paradox, can you briefly explain it?\n\nScott Wu (00:29:26):\nAbsolutely. Yeah. Jevons Paradox just says that as the price of something goes down, it can still be the case that the total spend on it actually goes up. You can think about this with money, you can think about this with time or resources, but the direct version here is, I think, as it becomes easier and easier to program and as programming becomes more and more effective, I think we're going to have a lot more programmers. I think in a kind of zero-sum view, you might say, \"Well, we're going to be 10 times faster at software engineering and it means that we're going to need 10 times fewer software engineers.\" But I think in practice, what really is going to happen is actually we're going to build even more than 10 times as much code. And because all of the work that we do is so capped, obviously, on our ability to actually build and execute and iterate, we're going to have so many great ideas out there, we're going to have so many great products out there. People are going to build a lot more personalized experiences, for example, and there's going to be a lot to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:22):\nGoing back to the way you guys use Devin, you said that every engineer has this fleet of Devins. How many Devins per engineer do you find most people are working with these days at your company?\n\nScott Wu (00:30:33):\nYeah. It's very asynchronous. Obviously, you can kick them up and start them up and shut them down basically as you see fit, but most folks on the team are often working with up to five Devins at once, I would say. It's a nice flow where you think through, \"All right, what are the five things that we want to get done today?\" You have Devin one do number one, you have Devin two do number two, Devin three... For what it's worth, I think it's taken us some time to adjust to it and get to the point where it's really intuitive for us, but I think it's definitely a different experience where you're handing off most things asynchronously. \n\n(00:31:14):\nThe goal for each of your tasks is to be there for the parts that really need your expertise, either you really, really need to define exactly what it is that you're solving for and what you're building or maybe some of the more complex parts where you want to steer Devin towards, particularly what kinds of changes you want to make. \"I want the class to be set up this way and we should go and change all the downstream references to this as well or whatever.\" But basically having Devin do the bulk of the work asynchronously with you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:43):\nAnd then how many engineers do you guys have roughly?\n\nScott Wu (00:31:46):\nYeah, our engineering team today is about 15 people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):\n15. 15.\n\nScott Wu (00:31:50):\n15, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:50):\nHoly moly. Okay. And then each one has five-ish Devins.\n\nScott Wu (00:31:54):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):\nSo there's five times the number of Devins as engineers. What I love about this is just a glimpse into where the future is going. You guys are so ahead of how companies work with AI engineers. Seeing how you operate is going to be, as a sense, essentially how most companies will end up operating.\n\nScott Wu (00:32:11):\nYeah. For what it's worth, we've already seen this shift, I would say, ourselves where... In terms of the team, obviously, folks don't spend that much of their time just writing out boilerplate or just doing pure implementation of features. People get to spend much more of their time focused on really just thinking about the core questions of, \"How do we make Devin better? What is the right interface for Devin? What is the right flow or the right set of features that's really going to make this as great of an experience as possible?\" That's how we like things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:46):\nWhen is the point you reach, where there's takeoff of this being the by... Your Devin starts moving so much further ahead of everyone else. Once you have enough Devins doing all these things, they're just like wherever and you're 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 100 years ahead.\n\nScott Wu (00:33:00):\nHonestly, as a community, I think all of us as engineers around the world, I think",

But what I would say is, I think more and more... Especially as capabilities get better, but certainly even in studies say today, I think more and more things are going to shift towards this asynchronous flow. And one of the reasons I would say for that is in the real world, you're just capped by real world constraints. I think that one way to put it is kind of like... Don't take these numbers exactly, but it's kind of like the first order math of it is, of course, being able to write files or to complete this function or complete this line or things like that.\n\n(00:33:44):\nIt helps a ton. It's a really great experience. There's a lot of parts of building software that obviously are almost not that at all, right? If you have a bug that you're trying to fix and so you spin up the local server, you click around on your own product on the front end and try to reproduce the bug yourself. Once you have the error, you take a look at Datadog and you see what happened and you try to find other errors in the logs. You look at those files and you see what went wrong, you make some edits, maybe you go and rerun the whole process again now that you make sure your change looks right. That's a lot of what it means to be a software engineer. These are processes that take real time. I think we're going to shift more and more towards this agentic workflow, because that's in some ways the way to really get to that 200%, 500%, 1000% gains that we'll be getting to with software engineering over the next few years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:39):\nEnough talk. Let's show people what the heck this actually looks like. You've got a couple demos prepped that show a few use cases that you found helpful. You're going to pull up your screen and then we'll kick it off and then we'll talk as it's happening.\n\nScott Wu (00:34:52):\nYeah. The whole process obviously of working with Devin is working asynchronously. I thought it'd be cool for us to actually just watch Devin a little bit in action and then we can go through some other examples of work that Devin's done or things that Devin does for us, even on our team for example. But then we can check back in asynchronously with our Devin after. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:12):\nLet's do it. \n\nScott Wu (00:35:13):\nI'll share this real quick. The key thing that I would just emphasize here is a lot of it obviously is really just about thinking about as a software engineer or as engineers ourselves or engineering teams, PMs, and so on. What are the things that we would want to build that we would want to hand off? We have Devin set up with our own Devin code base, for example, and so I'll go ahead and kick off with Devin for that. I'll just say, \"Devin, I'm on with my friend, Lenny.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:45):\nHi, Devin.\n\nScott Wu (00:35:48):\n\"Can you modify Devin web app two?\" Let's feature your newsletter as part of the Devin website. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:59):\nLet's do it. On the real Devin website. \n\nScott Wu (00:36:02):\n\"Feature Lenny's site.\" \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:04):\nYeah, lose all your features. \n\nScott Wu (00:36:06):\nWe're going to kick this off. As you can see, Devin gets started instantly and goes ahead and responds. Again, you can work with this asynchronously, you can work with it synchronously as well. For this, we'll just kind of go in a little bit and see exactly what's going on. But as you can see here, Devin's going through files and taking a look through a lot of stuff. We can follow here basically as we need to and see what makes sense. You can see Devin's already called out a few particular pieces where there's the sidebar, which we have implemented on the front end, and there's pieces there. We're going to have a new component and that component's going to link to Lenny's website. That all sounds good. Devin's asking us any questions if there's anything that we have here. Same story here where you can let Devin make its own decisions and hand off, or you can go ahead and give some more thoughts. Should the button open in a new tab or within an application? I'll say let's open it in a new tab.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):\nAnd you could answer these at any point. Is it waiting for the answer? \n\nScott Wu (00:37:06):\nYou answer these at any point, you can hand off, hand back off. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:07):\nIt's not going to be like, \"Just god damn it. I just wrote it this way. Why didn't you tell me earlier?\" \n\nScott Wu (00:37:11):\nThat's right. One of the big pieces with Devin is Devin will always be enthusiastic, will",

But I thought it'd be fun to show some other examples of Devin in action as well. One of the examples actually this morning, which I just used Devin for, is I asked Devin to help me brush my own facts up for this podcast. Obviously, a huge fan of the podcast and the newsletter. I asked Devin, \"Hey, Devin. I'm to be on the podcast. Could you please research everything you can about him and make a nice website quiz for me so that I can make sure I know my facts?\" This was just this morning, I asked Devin to do this and I'll just show what Devin did, it looks like. Went to Wikipedia first. Unfortunately, it's not a page in Wikipedia, which is... Lenny, we will work on that. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:09):\nI'm not a big enough deal yet. \n\nScott Wu (00:38:12):\nThey did you dirty. I mean, we need a page list. And so then it went and found it on Spotify.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:19):\nSo you're watching what it's researching live?\n\nScott Wu (00:38:21):\nYeah, yeah, yeah. This was this morning, obviously. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:24):\nThis is a playback of what Devin did. This is part of Devin you could just watch what it did.\n\nScott Wu (00:38:29):\nYeah, yeah. Especially when you're building engineering products or something like that, you can see each of the steps that Devin was doing, or if Devin tested the code locally, obviously you want to be able to go and look and see what Devin was cooking around with and testing or things like that. It found the newsletter. It's going and looking at this and it's going and reading all of this. And then it says, \"Okay, let's get started with putting the code together.\" It says, \"Hey, I've researched.\" It's going through and writing all of this, putting the app together. It plays its own quiz itself. Actually, we should just play this quiz actually. Let's see how much I know. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:05):\n[inaudible 00:39:05]\n\nScott Wu (00:39:06):\nWhat is the name?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:08):\nWhat is the name of the podcast? Lenny's Podcast. For people not watching, so to say, approximately how many subscribers? A million. Very good.\n\nScott Wu (00:39:17):\nYeah. Yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:18):\nWhat are three main topics Lenny is focused on? Oh, product, growth, and career. Very good. It's a good quiz [inaudible 00:39:25] of people. \n\nScott Wu (00:39:25):\nWhat does [inaudible 00:39:26] besides podcasting?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:27):\nWhat does Lenny do besides podcasting? \n\nScott Wu (00:39:30):\nI'd say writing, investing, and advising. How often does Lenny-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:35):\n[inaudible 00:39:35]\n\nScott Wu (00:39:35):\nOnce a week, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:36):\nOnce a week.\n\nScott Wu (00:39:37):\nYeah. We can go through all these and do all these. I took this quiz, by the way, obviously, to make sure that I was well-prepped, but this is kind of one of the more fun examples, obviously, of [inaudible 00:39:46]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:46):\nScott, how many subscribers do I have at my newsletter?\n\nScott Wu (00:39:50):\nOver a million, actually. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:52):\n[inaudible 00:39:52]\n\nScott Wu (00:39:53):\nAnd then one last one I'll show and then maybe we can come back to our initial run after. Like I was saying, a lot of this is really built to work with all of the existing code workflows out there. For example, we were doing some exploration with the DeepSeek repository on GitHub and we imported it into Devin and we got our own fork of it set up in Devin. A couple of things I just wanted to show here. One is Devin sets up its whole wiki with all of its internal understanding. When Devin indexes the code base, obviously, building a representation of the code base and learning it and improving it over time is one of the big things that Devin does. Funnily enough, we found that naturally humans really are interested to understand this code base representation",

Funnily enough, we found that naturally humans really are interested to understand this code base representation as well.\n\n(00:40:38):\nDevin Wiki is something that we built here and you can take a look at all these different pieces and see each of these different things. Here are the FP8 operations, here's an SG [inaudible 00:40:46] integration. There's diagrams of how the different layers are built and put together. There's deployment operations. There's a lot of details about the architecture as well. You can ask questions about it as well. For example, you can say, \"How does DeepSeek handle multi-token prediction designed for spec deck?\" It'll go through and it's able to search through the entire code base and give you an informed answer based off of that. \n\n(00:41:10):\nWe use this a lot. It helps when you're scoping out a task for Devin and doing an initial prompt. It also helps, obviously just in a vacuum, you often have questions about your code base that are really nice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:20):\nThis episode is brought to you by Attio, the AI-native CRM.

That's A-T-T-I-O.com/lenny. \n\n(00:42:21):\nSomething that I've learned as I've been talking to more and more AI building companies and apps is there's a big difference in how large of a code base they could integrate into. That's a big deal for companies that are existing versus startups, people that have large existing code base. How should people think about what kind of code base Devin can plug into?\n\nScott Wu (00:42:41):\nYeah. We go all the way to the biggest code base as possible. One way I'd kind of put it is how... The way that we as engineers would think about a large code base is certainly when you're making changes or when you're thinking about a particular task. You're not bringing in every single line of the code base at once. You have a high level of traction that you're able to think about and look into and then you're obviously able to zoom in and get to higher resolution on each of these different things. Devin works in much the same way, where the first thing it'll do is it's going to figure out the high level architecture of what's going on here and what this is built for and so on. But within each of the components, it's obviously also going to be able to zoom in and give some more detail about each of these. Here's FP8 to be float 16 and how exactly a lot of that is set up. Here's each of the different parts of the code base. Similarly, we built this to be scalable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:38):\nIt's essentially coming back to the engineer as architect. Now, it's helping you understand the architecture, kind of circling back to that.\n\nScott Wu (00:43:46):\nYeah. Yeah, exactly. One of the fun use cases that we've seen actually with folks is they'll often actually get Devin's help to onboard new engineers on the team. When you're new and you're joining, there's obviously a lot of questions that you have about the code base or about how things are set up. It also sometimes can be a little bit awkward to ask your mentor or your manager the questions and if you're worried that they're going to be really dumb questions. It's nice to just be able to ask Devin and to go through Devin's wiki and to understand these internal representations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:15):\nI think that's really interesting, because it comes back to your point that Devin is not just a junior engineer. It's what you call a jagged engineer.\n\nScott Wu (00:44:21):\nA jagged intelligence.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:22):\nA jagged intelligence, where it's almost like a staff engineer at understanding the code base. Usually, you have to ask an engineer that's been there a long time, \" What does this do? Where is this thing? How does this work?\" It feels like Devin's very good at that.\n\nScott Wu (00:44:34):\nYeah. Yeah. Obviously, the retrieval and processing a lot of code and a lot of tokens at once is something that language models are really great at. Basically being able to get those gains in the places that you need them is really great. Yeah. Sweet, cool. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):\nAll right. You got a couple more use?\n\nScott Wu (00:44:51):\nYeah. One",

You got a couple more use?\n\nScott Wu (00:44:51):\nYeah. One last thought I'll show is just... We just rolled this out last week actually, but it's a full Devin automation setup with Linear. If you have tasks that you're doing on the DeepSeek repository, for example, and it's all set up, all you have to do is you just add the Devin label and Devin will come through and it'll give you this. It's going to give you its thoughts on what the tasks looks like and you can take a look at each of the particular files that you see, or it'll point out snippets that it thinks are important. From there, if you feel good about what was built or the conclusions that we came to, then you can just start off the Devin session that will go and actually do that work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:30):\nThat is insane. That sounds like such a simple idea, but essentially what you're saying is there are tasks in Linear that are fixes and features and now Devin just goes off and can just do them for you.\n\nScott Wu (00:45:44):\nYeah. Definitely it's a hands-on process. You certainly want to be involved when Devin is scoping out the task or giving you its thoughts. The nice thing, too, by the way, is Devin will give you its confidence level. Here's how likely I am to really understand this piece or that piece or whatever, but it helps make things a lot faster. To your point, a lot of product managers, for example, obviously love to be able to use Devin in Linear to understand the code base better or things like that. Claire Vo, for example, from LaunchDarkly is a big Devin user and she loves basically going and scoping out tasks or asking data questions or asking, \"Hey, what's going on? Or is this merged into production yet? Or is this a feature flag right now? Or what percent of people are getting this or that feature?\" It's a clean way basically to make that intelligence much more accessible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:40):\nI love, just with the integration with Linear, that you can still keep it really simple. You add a little ticket like, \"Hey, this link to this home page, do this,\" and Devin will be really good at understanding what you mean and then show you, \"Here's what I'm thinking.\" Is this right?\n\nScott Wu (00:46:53):\nYeah. Yeah, cool. Okay. Yeah, Devin did finish working. It seems like there's something going on with the CI and it's debugging that right now, but it went ahead and put up the initial first pass pull request and we can take a look. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:04):\nLet's do it.\n\nScott Wu (00:47:06):\nThis is the Devin website, obviously, in this custom deploy and we have Lenny's newsletter right here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:11):\nLet's ship this to production. We won't be so confused.\n\nScott Wu (00:47:15):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:16):\nThat's amazing. Okay. Show it again real quick. Just added it to the home page of Devin.\n\nScott Wu (00:47:22):\nYeah. Devin, obviously, has access to our Devin code base. It does a lot here and so it's super familiar with all the pieces here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:28):\nBeautiful.\n\nScott Wu (00:47:29):\nYeah, I like how that looks. We've got Devin search, we got Devin [inaudible 00:47:33], and we've got Lenny's newsletter. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):\n[inaudible 00:47:34]. You link to my site. We'll get some PageRank going. \n\nScott Wu (00:47:37):\nYeah, yeah, yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:39):\nOkay. Is that a good example? Oh, there it is. What a beautiful website for my newsletter. Is that just a good example of the kind of thing Devin is very good at like, \"Here's a very specific thing to change on the website\"? How does your people think about what Devin is very good at and maybe where it starts to fall apart?\n\nScott Wu (00:47:55):\nThe way that we often describe it is, I think, Devin is best when it is working on tasks that are well-defined. One way to put it, you might...\n\nScott Wu (00:48:00):\nOn tasks that are well-defined. One way to put it is, you want to be giving Devin tasks, not problems. And a lot of these things like what you just saw, which was kind of like a quick front-end feature request or a bug fix or adding testing and documentation or things like that.\n\n(00:48:16):\nOne of the things that makes a loop really nice obviously is a quick way to iterate and test. And so with something like this, obviously super easy for us, for example, to just go pull up the preview and see that the link worked. Obviously it would be easy for Devin to do as well. Devin will often go and log in to Devin and start a Devin session and make sure when it's",

But yeah, you generally want something that is kind of easy to verify and easy to test is the main thing. And you can work on bigger projects or bigger asks as well, obviously. But in that case you should certainly expect to need to steer Devin more to make sure it's going the right direction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:55):\nIt's interesting because that's very similar to the way people talk about synthetic data and reinforcement learning, creating data that's very easy. There's a very definitive answer, yes and no.\n\nScott Wu (00:49:04):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):\nIt's very clear.\n\nScott Wu (00:49:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:07):\nOkay. Let me ask you this question. What's something that you guys debated a lot as you were designing and building Devin?\n\nScott Wu (00:49:15):\nI'll give a couple that comes to mind. One I would say is a question of, I'll call it how opinionated we should be. We had the workflows that we used to Devin for, which was very much as you can see for basically integrating to our Slack and GitHub making pull requests for us in our repos, responding to issue reports or things like that. And naturally we've had certainly a lot of other different things that have come up that folks have tried. I mean, we have folks who order their DoorDash with Devin, for example. Even we have folks, certainly a lot of people who are building cool websites from scratch or working on things like that.\n\n(00:49:53):\nYeah, I mean it is been an interesting trade off for us where I think the way that I would describe it is in our product, certainly the large bulk of the features that we build are for this kind of making pull requests and engineering teams use case. But I think basically our kind of general stance with all the others is obviously if folks want to use Devin for that, that's great and we want to just make sure that they're fully aware about the limitations and about where things can get caught up.\n\n(00:50:20):\nIt is funny with AI and especially because I would say one of, I would say the most common pieces of advice out there I would say is focus on a really niche cohort. Do things that don't scale, make one use case that's really great and then you grow from there. And I think that's great advice across the board. But yeah, it's kind of interesting because I think with generative AI, you naturally see this where a lot of product experiences can turn out to be more general. And so it's an interesting trade-off for us. This is something that we still always go back and forth on and how much do we want to do more to support all the other kind of use cases out there to handle other things that folks might want to do with Devin.\n\n(00:51:03):\nI think another one that comes to mind is how much Devin should be, let's say a single comprehensive project experience versus a suite of tools. And as you can see here, we have Devin search, we have Devin Wiki, we have the linear ticket scooping, and certainly these tools interact with each other, but I think as time has gone on, we've seen it more and more as really building this suite of tools. And I think the core agent experience and the core kind of agent that will go off and build each of these build things for you, for example, is always of course going to be that's Devin, and that is the core piece. I think that will always be what's really special about our work. But I think that all of the other features out there, there is a complex suite of work that's required for real-world software sharing and engineering is just messy at the end of the day.\n\n(00:51:55):\nAnd so I think there are a lot of different flows and a lot of different use cases that makes sense. And an obvious thing to point out is you could ask the same questions to Devin search as you could to Devin and Devin will go through and it'll do the same thing. It'll go through and look through the files and give you an answer and stuff.\n\n(00:52:10):\nBut with that said, on the one hand, I think on the capability side, there's certainly a lot you can do to really optimize things for very specifically question answer about this repository and that made sense to really build into a specific kind feature.\n\n(00:52:23):\nAnd then on the other side, I would say we found that users actually really, really like having this access of control. Sometimes you have a task that you're thinking about, but you actually don't want Devin to get started on the task just yet. You want to ask Devin and understand what parts of the code base might be relevant. And so you want to be very direct about saying, \"This is just an ask and I just want to see the snippets of the code base that relate,\" or, \"I just want to look at the Wiki and understand the existing representation.\"\n\n(00:52:50):\nAnd so it's on both the capabilities and on the UX side, we've found that that's kind of what's naturally made sense over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:",

There's all these different approaches. You guys are going full on AI engineer, there's obviously ID companies. There's also just models being built that are really good at engineering. Everyone's kind of starting to build agents now. You guys are ahead on this in a lot of ways. OpenAI just recently said they're going to build a software engineering agent. Anthropics got something there. Cursor and Windsurf have their only agents and Replit. Thoughts on just where you guys fit in the landscape and then how do you think you win long term. How do you think about that?\n\nScott Wu (00:53:31):\nYeah, and for what it's worth, I think all of these are incredible teams. I think really smart and really forward-thinking folks who are building a lot of great products out there. And I think there's a lot to do honestly over the next few years with the advent of AGI or whatever you want to call it. I think one of the quotes that I love is in 2017, if you asked if we had AGI, the answer is no. And in 2025, if you ask if we have AGI, the answer is, \"Well, you have to define AGI. And it depends on your subject.\" And I think it does get to the point of, I mean there is a lot of really amazing stuff happening. I think that it's easy to underrate, I would say just how big of a shift it is that we're seeing where I think there are a lot of great products out there, for example, over the last 10 years, 20 years, 30 years, that have made each of these different niches of the life cycle of building a product a little bit easier, for example, right?\n\n(00:54:28):\nThere's great products out there for instant response, there's great products out there for logging, there's great products out there for billing, there's all of these different tools. And the obvious thing is what we're seeing with AI is all of these spaces are going to be moving multiple times faster and it's going to be like an order of magnitude shift, if anything.\n\n(00:54:47):\nAnd so I think from our perspective, we've obviously had a very specific lens that we've bet on this whole time, and that is autonomous coding agents. And there's a lot of problems to solve there, to be honest, right? There's still a ton to do on the core capabilities, certainly, and we see cases all the time where it's like, wow, why did Devin make that decision? That seems, no human engineer would've ever done that. There's all sorts of spots where, with the product interface, there's obviously a lot to think about.\n\n(00:55:16):\nAnd I think it's by the way, not just a single thing that we're working towards, but something that will change with every edition of capabilities. I kind of think of it as there's 20 generations of agent product, agent coding experiences to come. I think the one that we'll get to over the course of several years is probably something where you don't even look at the code at all, right? And you're actually just looking at your own product and you're just able to look and specify and say, \"Hey, this button should be a little bit rounder. Let's do that. And by the way, let's add a new tab here and maybe we should save this information. Let's start up a database table and let's index it on X, Y, and Z columns.\" And you're just basically working with your products in real time and having your agent build out those things for you. Obviously there's going to be a lot of generations in between here and there, but I think the product experience itself is going to change every single time.\n\n(00:56:04):\nAnd then obviously there, there's all of the practicality of just getting it out there in the world. And so folks obviously need to learn how to use the new technology. There's a lot to do to deploy into all of the messiness of real world software. There's a lot of COBOL out there still. There's a lot of FORTRAN out there still. There's lots of kind of abstractions and details that folks have done.\n\n(00:56:27):\nAnd so I think from our perspective, we have since the beginning have been laser-focused on agentic coding, and that is the one thing that we've really believed in. It's the one thing that we've designed for and that goes all the way to even the revenue model with ACUs and having the usage-based setup. It does into obviously all the product experiences of thinking how, okay, where do you want to talk to Devin? You want to be able to talk to Devin in Slack, you want to be able to spin this up from your issue. You want to be able to all of these things and then of course the capabilities.\n\n(00:56:58):\nAnd so I don't think there's any one easy answer. I think it's obviously a combination of things, but this has been the space that we've lived in and spent all of our time in for the last year and a half, and it's going to be that way for the next five or 10 years too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky",

How do you just think about how to build a moat in this space when it's so much easier to build and so much is built on these models that are themselves advancing so quickly?\n\nScott Wu (00:57:30):\nI'd give one slight tweak on that, which is I think it's often less about moats and more about stickiness. And what I mean by that is moats are in some sense, typically what folks mean by moats is something that means that a competitor couldn't even enter the market. And I agree that at a high level, a lot of different folks at different layers of the AI spectrum, the foundation labs or the application layer or so on, I don't think there's any kind of hard barrier that would prevent others from entering. I think what does exist is stickiness, which I would kind of define as once you have a product experience that you really like, are you excited to keep using that experience or is there an effect where it is just as easy from now on to just switch on to a new one and learn a new one and so on.\n\n(00:58:15):\nAnd I think from that perspective, I think there's a few things that are really great about coding agents in particular. One I would say is there is a lot of just inherent stickiness and learning and buildup over time, which is that as you use Devin and as your whole team uses Devin, it's the same thing with an engineer. If you're joining on day one versus you've been at the company for five years, you wrote half the code yourself, you've touched every file you've built every single piece, you know all the engineers. And so similarly, it's like Devin will really learn and build its representation of your code base and of your stack and of your process over time and will be able to do a lot more with that.\n\n(00:58:51):\nAnd then the other piece of it, which I think is really exciting I'd say is there really is a lot to do of what I would call a multiplayer aspect of code, which if you think about it, is how a lot of things get done in the real world, certainly. And so it's one thing to have your own experience, which you use yourself as just an engineer, but for example, ourselves, we see this all the time where some engineers are working with Devin and teaching Devin things and as I mentioned, folks will have Devin on board their new engineers and kind of convey that knowledge to them.\n\n(00:59:24):\nOr similarly, it's like I'll start a session with Devin in Slack and I'll say, \"Hey, it'd be cool if we could do this thing.\" And some other engineer will chime in and say, \"Oh, by the way, the reason we did it initially was X and Y.\" And so Devin, just make sure when you do this change that you still support that workflow. And Devin will say, \"Okay, sounds great.\" Or Devin will make a PR, I'll be working with Devin, we'll make pull requests and GitHub and somebody else will be reviewing that PR or give some comments and Devin will work on that too. You'll be in linear.\n\n(00:59:52):\nSo all these kind of spaces, it really does just kind of set up for an experience basically where Devin can just grow in the value that it can provide for your whole work over time. And so I think from that perspective, if anything, we want there to be a lot of innovation and a lot of new products and so on. I don't think that the goal is to try to lock other people out of building. There's a lot of stuff to build, and I think there's going to be a lot of different experiences. I think from our perspective, what we think about is more like how can we make Devin more and more and more useful as you're using it more?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:27):\nIt's very similar. We had Michael from Cursor, the CF Cursor on the podcast, and he had a similar point of just he thinks moats are just kind of like consumer, like Google is the way, he thinks it's like Google where people can easily switch. You just have to stay the best, and that's the answer. And it feels like you're adding to that of just like, but also if you can create some stickiness where it is very hard to leave because it's so good at what it's doing and it's built knowledge and integrated to your workflows and builds on that on that stickiness.\n\nScott Wu (01:00:58):\nYeah, and I think one of the things that's nice about our space too is, software engineering for better for worse has a very clear tie to value. And what it means is, I guess one way to put it is there is always kind of a clear next level, at least for the next while. I think there could be some point where you're just like, \"All right, just build the entirety of YouTube for me.\" And Devin just does the whole, it's like there's probably been a hundred million hours of human engineering time building YouTube, building the algorithm, building all the infrastructure, all of the, everything, every little detail. And maybe there's some",

And maybe there's some time where Devin just does that out of the box. That's obviously going to be a long time from now.\n\n(01:01:36):\nI think on the interim, on every level in between, obviously it makes a difference the quality of software engineering. And I think one of the cool things with developers obviously is developers are really willing to learn new experiences and to put in effort if it means that they're able to have a higher and higher quality experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:57):\nAwesome. I'm going to spend a little time on the tech that enables Devin. Without divulging trade secrets, just what allowed you to make Devin so good? Was there an unlock with a certain model? Some folks have shared three points on a 3.5 was a huge unlock for a lot of their products. Just what's kind of the key to the way you've architected or built Devin that makes it work so well?\n\nScott Wu (01:02:20):\nWe obviously, we've been betting on agents for a long time. I think that agents were doable and workable a lot earlier than most folks might've thought. But certainly I think as the community has really rallied around it, I mean you see the impacts of that in the pre-training, you see the impacts of that in a lot of the work that's done with these models. I actually don't think there's been any, from our perspective, I don't think there's been any single step function based model shift or anything that has been kind of like a night and day difference in Devin, but I certainly think that the curve of every point on the chart, I mean there's a new model that comes out every week now has obviously made a big difference in terms of what we've been able to do. And then obviously on top of that, we work with the research teams at all these foundation labs to do a lot of our work on top.\n\n(01:03:11):\nAnd so I think that my hot take here at which I would give is, I think in terms of base intelligence, we're honestly basically already there. And I think a lot of what we see actually and what we spend our time on is less so, obviously, we don't our own models or things like that. It's less so increasing the base IQ of a model, for example, and more about teaching it all of the idiosyncrasies of real-world engineering and thinking about here's how you use Datadog and do this, and here's how you might diagnose this error and here are the different things that you could run into and here's how you handle each of those. And when you're ready, here's how you make GitHub PR.\n\n(01:03:50):\nAnd this is true in engineering. It's true in every other space as well. I mean, there's so much detail and idiosyncrasy to the work that we all do obviously day to day. And a lot of it is kind of like teaching the model to mirror the complexity of the real world, I would say, rather than getting it to some higher fundamental level of problem solving, which I think the foundation labs are doing a really great job.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:15):\nThere's something you shared when we were chatting before we started recording around the growth of previous transformative technologies were very hardware oriented and there was a limiting factor to their growth and AI is not that. Can you just share that insight?\n\nScott Wu (01:04:30):\nFor a number of reasons? I think AI is going to be the biggest technology shift of our lives, but I think one thing, which is what we were just talking about before this, which is most of the big tech revolutions that we've had over the last 50 years, I mean, I'm thinking about personal computer and the internet and the mobile phone and stuff, they all had this big hardware component that was a big part of the distribution. And so you had the internet, and initially it was just these universities that were talking with one another, but obviously over time we got the whole world plugged into the internet and it took years and years and years. Same thing was true with mobile phones. Same thing was true with PC.\n\n(01:05:06):\nAnd the thing that's interesting about that in particular, which is I would say we're already seeing the effects of that, is in these hardware distribution machines, obviously there's a lot that depends on real time. And so folks who were building for those industries saw their market grow and grow and grow basically steadily year over year as the number of people with mobile phones increased, as the number of people connected to the internet increased. And many of those businesses, it's still crazy to think, but many of those businesses got started right in the beginning. I mean, Apple and Microsoft were started right around the same time. And same is true for a lot of the great internet businesses or wherever, but certainly it was something that touched whole world with time or a large fraction of the whole world. And it had a really massive impact, but it took place over several years because of the time that it took. And I think one of the things which is already I'd say different in AI, is just how explosive the technology can be. Once AI could, and I think we're firmly past the inflection point in AI code where it's, as an engineer, if you're not using AI at all",

And I think one of the things which is already I'd say different in AI, is just how explosive the technology can be. Once AI could, and I think we're firmly past the inflection point in AI code where it's, as an engineer, if you're not using AI at all to write code, I mean you're falling behind honestly. And it is a technology that everyone should have and should be using, and there's no kind of weight on hardware distribution that is causing that. It means that the space is just growing so exponentially, basically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:36):\nMichael Ballin has this interesting point that cliches are cliches because they're so true and that's why they're cliches. I heard that a million times and I think it's like people hear this like, \"Yeah, yeah, I know,\" but it's actually insane what is happening. That's why you're here to help us through this transition.\n\nScott Wu (01:06:52):\nYeah, no, I mean, it is a fun time and I think there will be real investment and real work that it takes. But I think from the perspective of us as engineers, for example, I think it just means it's so important to stay in the loop with everything that's happening. And as we're seeing it's not only because of your learning and your ability to work these technologies, but it's also about basically teaching the AI what there is to know about your code base in order to make it really effective at building with you and doing more of the things that you would want it to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:27):\nSo along those lines, for people listening that they're like, \"Hey, we should be using Devin at our company,\" what are things you've found to be helpful in helping an engineer at a company get adoption and be able to use Devin either culturally or logistically?\n\nScott Wu (01:07:42):\nSo a pattern which we often see with folks is there will be a few folks at the team who are really excited and want to try out the new thing, and they want to put in the investment and are really excited to get it going. And they'll go through all the setup. They'll give Devin the repos, they'll teach Devin how to run the lint and the CI and all of those details. And they'll start off by giving it those initial tasks and help Devin build a foothold basically. And as time goes on, eventually folks will see, \"Wow, Devin's writing all these PRs, Devin's doing this [inaudible 01:08:14].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:13):\nWho's this Devin person that just joined the company's just knocking out PRs?\n\nScott Wu (01:08:17):\nYeah. And they'll see that, and then naturally they'll get on and they'll get an account. And one of the cool things of course is by the time they join, Devin already knows a good amount of detail about the repositories that they're already working in and they're working with that. And so one of the really cool things which we often see is that the early adopters themselves can really pave the way I think, for everyone else on the team.\n\n(01:08:37):\nBut yeah, I think the main thing I would just kind of call out is it really does take, it's a very different product experience, and I think for what it's worth, I think there's still a lot more that we can do to make it as intuitive and as clear as possible to folks like how to use Devin and what the right steps are and how to really maximize value out of Devin. But I think that, yeah, it's the kind of thing where if you put in the investment and understand exactly what it takes to get Devin to be successful, we've found ourselves that as time has gone on, we just use Devin more and more and more with every next update.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:15):\nSo let me follow that thread. There is a question I ask every AI app building founder, which is, if you could sit next to every new user of Devin and whisper something in their ear to help them be successful with Devin, one or two tips, what would those tips be?\n\nScott Wu (01:09:31):\nI think the biggest thing I would say is it really is just treat Devin like your new junior engineer. And I think that's the biggest thing. I think folks come in and they see the blank page and they think of all sorts of various things that they want to try out. They think of lots, where I think typically the flow that we see that works best is obviously you can try demos and you can do things, but a lot of it is just like, \"Yeah, let's figure out what tickets we want to get done today or this week and let's have Devin get started on those and let's start with the easier ones and then work with Devin and understand what things Devin needs to get set up to be able to test its own code and do this well. And then let's scale up over time.\" And then obviously as you work with your engineer, you understand better how to communicate with them or what are the right tasks or projects to bring them in on. But I think that really is the one-liner for us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:31):\nOkay. There's a question I'd be meeting task. I just want to get back to this because it's something I think a lot about with Devins. Everyone's going to have five Devins, let's say 10 Devins.

There's a question I'd be meeting task. I just want to get back to this because it's something I think a lot about with Devins. Everyone's going to have five Devins, let's say 10 Devins. Everyone's kind of turning into basically an engine manager with a bunch of junior engineers, which isn't necessarily the best job in the world because it's just a bunch of, at least you don't have to do performance reviews and one-on-ones, but it's sitting around, checking a lot of PRs all day. There's a sense of you become an architect, which is kind of what every engineer wants to become eventually, right? They're all, \"I just want to think about the architecture. I don't want to code all these stupid, fix bugs.\"\n\n(01:11:06):\nSo I get that there's a good side to that, but just I imagine you're thinking a lot about this, just like how do you make life pleasant and fun and enjoyable as basically an engine manager of say, 500 Devins in the future?\n\nScott Wu (01:11:19):\nYeah, I can just imagine the performance, \"Devin, you've done a really great job on your task, but I really would like you to be more proactive in the team meetings.\" So what I'd say-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:29):\n[inaudible 01:11:29].\n\nScott Wu (01:11:29):\nIt's funny actually because something that in terms of the wording that we thought a lot about as well is just, we've used the term manager of Devins in the past, which of course I think is a big part of it. But I think that the only thing I would point out here is I think that the bricklayer versus architect is closer to the experience than being a manager. Because I think a lot of the difficulty of management or the reason that people shy away from it is more because of a lot of the various.\n\nScott Wu (01:12:00):\n... [inaudible 01:12:00] because of a lot of the various, let's say... There's all of the context, and the ownership, and the responsibility and stuff, and then there's also all of the emotional aspects of it. Where, I think working with Devin is a little more like just being, more as having an interface to hand off tasks and build tasks. And so, the parallel that I would draw is when we invented Python, obviously... It's like, in many ways the description and the outlining of tasks, obviously it was a different paradigm, but I think certainly it was nowhere near what folks typically think of as management bureaucracy today.\n\n(01:12:50):\nAnd I think that with Devin, a lot of it is just like, it's more like finding the right levels of abstraction that you could work with Devin on, and just finding the workflows that work really well, and the obvious thing to say here is, it's like you can always have Devin take a first pass at things. And so you have Devin take the first pass, if it's great, you merge it right away, if it needs some touch up, you can obviously give that feedback, for example, but a lot of it is like, it's more about, basically making Devin part of your flow than it losing control, which I think is the main thing that folks are scared of with management.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:34):\nAre you thinking about a manager Devin? Like a Devin that manages other Devins?\n\nScott Wu (01:13:37):\nYeah, yeah. So, for what it's worth, Devin can start other Devins through the API, right? And so, we've seen this happen quite a bit of times, where naturally if you have some big tasks that you want to do, Devin will do this all the time, it'll chunk up and then [inaudible 01:13:53] into smaller Devins. And so, it's the kind of thing that you need to give Devin the credentials to be able to do that, it's not currently something that is default enabled, but I can certainly imagine as time goes on that there's more and more of that\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:03):\nDevins all the way down.\n\nScott Wu (01:14:05):\nYeah, yeah. I think the thing that's kind interesting too is, with humans, the way I almost say it, in technical terms, it's like there's this coupling of a context and a thread, and what I mean by that is basically, each human can only operate a single threaded on the work that they do, and they have their set of context, and then there's other humans obviously who can do other stuff at the same time, but they have their own context. With agents, one of the cool things is you can have an agent that's doing multiple lines of exploration at once, but is sharing all of the context of everything that they find, and so I think that this is very early, and I think we'll see this, but folks obviously love to talk about basically systems of agents communicating with one another, and I think that there will be a lot of new paradigms to build for, once we get there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:55):\nAnd it's so interesting what you said about the decision between having one Devin and only one Devin do all the things, and you just tell them things and they fire off jobs versus you have five Devins, and they're each doing individual things, it's such an interesting decision to make.\n\nScott Wu (01:15:10):\nYeah,",

Maybe the most counterintuitive thing you've learned so far building Devin, that maybe goes against startup wisdom, common startup wisdom?\n\nScott Wu (01:15:21):\nSomething I've thought about a lot lately as we've built this is, this is not my first company, actually for a lot of us, it's not our first company, I think of our 26 or 27 people total on the team, I think 18 of us have started our own company before this. And yeah, one of the things I think about is, there's actually your point about cliches I think really spoke to me as well, which is, there's the really common things which you hear all the time in startups, where you're like, you got to move fast, or you got to hire great people, it's like, okay, well, obviously you do, I wasn't planning on not hiring great people, I wasn't planning on going slow. And similarly it's like, yeah, you really got to build something that people want. And there's these three to five things which are always repeated, and they're always the common wisdom in startups.\n\n(01:16:11):\nAnd I definitely had this idea as a founder, when I was starting initially, that, all right, so those are the three to five basic things, but as you get really deep into it, you spend a lot of years into it, you learn all of the thousands of other things that you have to learn to build a company. And I think to some extent that's, of course, true, and there's lots of little details that you'll get into with all these different things, including team building, and product, and strategy, and engineering decision-making, and fundraising, and sales, and every other component. But I also realized that as time has gone on, more and more, I felt like building companies well sometimes just comes down to doing those three to five things just even more than you could possibly expect.\n\n(01:16:58):\nAnd so, with us, it's like... And everyone says we go fast, but it's like, yeah, we had a hackathon in November, we had another hackathon in December, we started the company officially in January, we got the prototypes out to initial users in February, we did a launch in March, we got our first customers in April... It's just like, basically truly pushing the pace in every spot where we possibly could has really made a difference for us. And similarly, it's like, yeah, everyone always says you should hire great people, but I think that the truth within that truth is basically you should fight to all ends basically, to get the folks that you really want to bring in. And one of my favorite stories to share is we had a candidate who came and interviewed, he was a junior at MIT, so he was very, very young, and we gave him an interview, and he did way better than almost any of the full-time candidates that we had ever talked to. And so, we said, hey, what do you think about taking some time off of school and working with us and building out Devin?\n\n(01:17:57):\nWe really think you're just going to be able to come in and just have a ton of impact already from day one. And he thought about it for a while, and he came back and he said, you know what? I'm down, I want to do it, but my parents really want me to graduate from school, and I'm just not sure there's a way to make it work. And so, we talked him more and just understood the situation, and then we flew to North Carolina, went straight from the airport to his parents' house, had dinner with him and his parents, we talked a lot, a really nice Gujarati family, we gave them some gifts and just talked to them about it, and try to understand what would it take, and what would we need to make work. And they just said, it sounds like a great opportunity, but we really want our son to be able to graduate.\n\n(01:18:45):\nAnd we talked that through and we figured out a setup basically, where he could work for us essentially full time, but then come in for his required classes, and do what he needed to do to get the diploma basically, but no more than that. And we talked that through, and then we got to a point where everyone was happy with that, and then went straight back to the airport and flew right back, basically. And that was the first and only time that I've ever been in North Carolina, and it was just a great trip. And it is the kind of thing where it's like, hiring great people is one thing, but truly just never giving up, and really giving it everything that you can to make it work for people who really makes sense to be on the team. And he's been with us on the team for over a year now, and he's been an incredible, incredible engineer, and we wouldn't be here without him.\n\n(01:19:31):\nAnd similarly, we had someone else who was again, really, really talented candidate, did amazingly well, very young, and had a lot of great offers at a lot of other companies, and we were talking to them about",

And he's been with us on the team for over a year now, and he's been an incredible, incredible engineer, and we wouldn't be here without him.\n\n(01:19:31):\nAnd similarly, we had someone else who was again, really, really talented candidate, did amazingly well, very young, and had a lot of great offers at a lot of other companies, and we were talking to them about, he wanted to start his own company someday as well, and we were talking to him about certainly a lot of the obvious things, which are having him meet our investors, or get to do work with customers, or see a lot of these other components so that when the time came that he would have all the experience he needed to start his own company. But one of the other things that was big is he was talking with a lot of great companies already, he didn't want to burn any bridges, and so we actually worked with him and basically hand wrote all of his rejection responses to each of the other companies, and worked with him on it to say, here's how you should say it in a way that's going to come off as that you really did appreciate the time with them, and that obviously you want to remain close with them and stay in touch. And it was the kind of thing obviously where it's like, look, obviously our job is to make sure that he's happy enough that he doesn't want to leave at any time in the near future, but I think it's the kind of thing where the way that you put together a really, really great team is by fighting for what's right for them too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:45):\nWow, those are incredible stories. And it makes so real these, as you say, cliches, hire the best people, this is what it sounds like to hire the best people. This is what it takes.\n\nScott Wu (01:20:56):\nYeah, no, and I was just saying, a lot of things we've fought very hard to just reimagine things from the ground up because a lot of it really is just thinking about where do we think the technology is going over the next five, 10 years, and what is the place that we want to have in that future?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:16):\nI wonder if people are going to be fighting for the best Devin someday. They're just going to [inaudible 01:21:19] Devins.\n\nScott Wu (01:21:18):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:19):\nThey're [inaudible 01:21:22] so smart.\n\nScott Wu (01:21:22):\nI'll give you overtime pay, benefits, free healthcare, and everything, and then the Devin's like...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:29):\nThree Devins like Magic: The Gathering cards.\n\nScott Wu (01:21:31):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:32):\nAnd then just going back to your three to five things. So, essentially this is incredible advice, essentially, it's like you always hear hire the best people, move fast, build things people want.\n\nScott Wu (01:21:41):\nYeah, build something people want, stay as close as possible to your customers, and then I think the other thing is just always think about where things are going, not where they are today. I feel like those are the five things, which is... Especially in AI, with things moving so fast, and there's so much great talent, I feel like a lot of these are even more true, where it's like it's not just thinking about where things are going to be in 10 years, it's like thinking about what's going to happen next week. And obviously, things are moving very quickly, and it is very hard to predict, but you really have to be very rigorous with yourself, I'd say, about thinking through those things and evaluating all of the decisions that you make in that lens.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:25):\nAnd staying focused is the big takeaway to me here, is it ends up feeling like there's 1000 things you should do, but it's always these five things.\n\nScott Wu (01:22:31):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:33):\nScott, we covered a lot of ground. We went through every question I had, which is great, is there anything else that you want to share? Anything else you want to leave your listeners with, maybe a final nugget or something really you want to double down on that we said before we let you go?\n\nScott Wu (01:22:49):\nThe biggest thing that comes to mind for me is there's a lot of different perceptions about AI, right? I think basically every emotion under the sun right now. There's a lot of fear, for example, there's also a lot of skepticism, and we're very skeptical types as well, and we always wanted to try it ourselves to really see it and believe it. And I think the main thing that comes to mind for me, is I'm honestly really optimistic about what we're building here with AI, not just with code and with Devin, but the whole space, and everything that's getting done. And I think one of the cool things that is really actively happening is just the ability for everyone to multiply themselves, and that's how we've always thought about it, it's how we've thought about what we're building. And I think there is a lot more to do out there in the world, I'm not too worried about us running out of things to do, and from that lens, I think that the thing that we've always been most excited about is, how can we",

And I think there is a lot more to do out there in the world, I'm not too worried about us running out of things to do, and from that lens, I think that the thing that we've always been most excited about is, how can we all do more?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:52):\nI hear you Scott. Well, with that optimism, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nScott Wu (01:23:59):\nYeah, let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:00):\nOkay, here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nScott Wu (01:24:07):\nIn terms of nonfiction, I think for folks in startups, I think one of the things that I've really enjoyed is just learning and understanding the history of Silicon Valley. And it's all of these things that we think about, somebody invented them. It's one of the great realizations I feel like, is somebody invented the idea of a seed route, somebody invented the idea of venture capital, somebody invented the idea of product-market fit, and all of these different principles that we talk about. And so, for that, there's a book called The Power Law by Sebastian Mallaby, which I really like. And basically, it's just a tour of many of the great businesses and the great products that have been built over the last 60, 70 years in Silicon Valley, which I really love. I think in terms of fiction, I actually have always really liked The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, it's one of my personal favorites as a fiction book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:57):\nDo you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nScott Wu (01:25:01):\nI have to admit, I have not watched... I can't think of a single movie or TV show that I have watched in the last while, so I'm sure, I'm looking forward to watching a lot of great ones post-AGI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:17):\nThat's got to be in the trailer, that's great, I like that. And that just shows how hard you're working, just how much shit is going on, and how fast everything's moving. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be something physical, could be a toothbrush.\n\nScott Wu (01:25:32):\nOne I would say is I got an Aura frame recently, it's just like a frame that shows photos, and you can show a new photo every day, or every hour, or every 15 minutes, or whatever you like. I've actually, I've really enjoyed it a lot, I think it's a nice way to basically just have a picture frame memories that come up. And then, the other thing I would say as a general purpose thing, it's not particularly new, but I would say, I think AirPods are extremely well-built and well-designed. And I realize now that it's like, I basically use them for all... I'm taking calls on a walk and I'm using AirPods, obviously I'm doing work at my computer, at my desk, I'm plugged into AirPods, and it works quite well, honestly, for a lot of different situations, and they're very comfortable, they're very consistent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:21):\nI'm going to double down on the Aura frame, I also, I got one of these for my mom and my mother-in-law, and they're so great for just sharing photos of your kids with your family. And people have, they've heard of digital picture frames, but the Aura just does it really well, and it's really easy to add photos, and they're just really nice looking.\n\nScott Wu (01:26:39):\nYou can imagine not that long from now, we'll have the Aura Frame except Studio Ghiblifies every photo that you have in it, and then it's... Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:47):\nOr just imagines things you've done that are really cool. Look at my sweet life. Yeah. Cool. And it's Aura, it's A-U-R-A, I believe is how you spell it. Folks who want to check it out, we'll link to it. Not affiliated. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful in work or in life?\n\nScott Wu (01:27:06):\nYeah, something I've thought about a lot is a lot of the proverbs out there are actually contradictions, right? It's like birds of a feather, and then you also have opposites attract, and you have all... And it's kind of funny, because you feel that both of them are true, and often they both are true, and a lot of it is about understanding why. And one of those that I feel like, especially in the world of startups that I think about all the time is, I think it is very important to be focused and driven, and to really maximize your potential, and then at the same time, it's also very important to not let your own personal emotion get tied up in your success or failure, and I think especially with startups, because there's always ups and downs, honestly, even in the most successful companies ever, it's just like, it's a rocky road, there's a lot that happens, and a lot that goes down.\n\n(01:28:03):\nAnd I think one of the things which I've thought a lot",

Basically, you want to put it all out on the field. But at the same time, you want to be okay with both wins and losses, and you want to be able to move on, and go into the next one each time. And something, yeah, it's funny, but what I've found personally is that obviously it's really important for your own emotional state and mental state to be able to do that, and we've had lots of mistakes, and I've had a lot.\n\n(01:28:49):\nI had my first company, which obviously, which was cool, but there are a lot of tricky spots there, and then over the course of Cognition, it feels like it's been already eight years compressed into one year, and it's still going at that pace. But somehow it also actually makes you more successful, I think, too. It's like, you are just more able to give it your best, and to do the things that will lead to success if you're not tying it up in your own personal worth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:19):\nThat is so interesting, I just had a podcast recording recently where with an executive coach, Jerry Kelowna, that I think will come out before this, might be after this, that's one of his big pieces of advice, and it's a very Buddhist approach of just [inaudible 01:29:33] and attaching to a certain outcome.\n\nScott Wu (01:29:35):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:36):\nOkay. Final question, I'm curious if there's a story here, but we could keep it short, is there a story behind Devin as the name, or is there another contender for Devin being the [inaudible 01:29:48]?\n\nScott Wu (01:29:47):\nDevin was the name from pretty early on, we were interested, we were working on coding agents from the beginning, and my co-founders are Steven and Walden, for example, and we had this idea, all right, let's get started, and let's try to expand the box as much as we can. So, have everyone think out of the box and do their own thing, and let's have everyone do their own thing first for a bit, and then we'll consolidate and take everything that we've learned. And so, Walden made a virtual developer version of him, which was called DevWalden, and then Steven made one of him, which is called DevSteven, and we had all these... And then we were kind of combining it all into one thing, and we're like, okay, you know? It's Devin. And that was the thing. And so Devin was, yeah, Devin stuck for us quite early on, I would say.\n\n(01:30:31):\nOne thing which we did have a big decision on though actually is what the image of Devin would be. And so, as folks know, there's the hexagons and then people have seen this more recently, but there's actually also an otter, a little otter with a laptop in its lap, and that is Devin as well. And we had this debate over what to go with, and what not to go with and stuff, and it's been a while now, but somehow we still have both the hexagons and the otter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:01):\nYou skipped over where the Devin, did you have just have, it just came to you?\n\nScott Wu (01:31:06):\nOh, so Devin is, it's a dev. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:10):\n[inaudible 01:31:10].\n\nScott Wu (01:31:09):\nAnd so, it was kind of like, when we were consolidating all the names, it just seemed clear then that this would be the universal dev that we all liked to work with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:17):\nWow.\n\nScott Wu (01:31:18):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:18):\nIncredible. Scott, this was so much fun. Oh my God, I learned a ton, which is always a really good sign. Two final questions, where can folks find you/Devin/anything else you want to point them to, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nScott Wu (01:31:29):\nAwesome. Yeah, no, we're at App.devin.ai, and you can find us as well on Twitter or a lot of other social media. We'd obviously love to hear any feedback you have about the Devin product, there's so much to figure out, and I think the, like I said, I think we're all still 20 steps away from really the future of software engineering, and so it really means a lot to hear what folks think about the product as they're trying it out. And so, please let us know anytime if there's things that we can do to make it better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:00):\nScott, thank you so much for being here.\n\nScott Wu (01:32:02):\nThank you so much for having",

And you rub the lamp and this genie comes out and the genie says, \"Hey, I can give you one wish. Whatever you throw yourself into with your whole life and your career, it's going to turn out great.\" If that were true and you had that genie, what would you wish for? At some point in this one life we get, you want to get yourself on that path of that journey.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):\nThis whole exercise connects to something that you're a big advocate of, this idea of getting out of autopilot mode in your life.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:00:40):\nYou're unconscious, and you may not even realize why you're doing what you're doing or even realize what you're doing. So for example, I get up, work out, drive into work, fight traffic, commute, maybe I return some emails, fight traffic on the way home, rush through dinner, go to bed. It's not a day that is intentional. It's not a day where I've said, \"Where do I want to be going with my life? What's important to me in this world?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):\nYou another quote, which is, \"Everything that you want is on the other side of worse first.\"\n\nGraham Weaver (00:01:07):\nPick anything. You want a better body? Okay, you're going to need to go to the gym. When you go to the gym the first few times, it's going to not be that fun. The first move is negative. If I'm optimizing for tomorrow and I just want to have a great day tomorrow, I'm going to stay exactly where I am. So many people I see have this happen, where they hit a plateau and they never move past it, because they're not willing to have that hard day, month, week, year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):\nWhen should you quit something, because some things are just not worth it.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:01:37):\nI think the time to quit is when you can no longer ...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:44):\nToday, my guest is Graham Weaver. Graham teaches a top-rated course at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, a course which is technically called Managing Growing Enterprises. But as you'll hear in our conversation, he ends up mostly helping students figure out what to do with their lives and how to get out of the autopilot mode that most people are in. He recently won Stanford Graduate Business School's 2024 MBA Distinguished Teaching Award. And teaching is actually his side gig. His full-time job is founder and CEO of Alpine Investors, a private equity firm, which based on my research, is one of if not the top-performing private equity fund in the world. So the advice you're going to hear today is coming from someone who is actually doing the thing, not just teaching the thing.\n\n(00:02:28):\nIn our conversation, we cover practical exercises that can help you figure out what you should do with your life, including something he calls the genie framework and the nine lives exercise. We talk about why life is suffering, and you may as well choose something worth suffering for, also, why most things in life that are worthwhile take more time than you expect, some practical advice for creating accountability in your life to help you achieve your goals, and so much more.\n\n(00:02:53):\nIf you listen to this episode and actually try some of the exercises that Graham shares, I promise you that your life and your future will be better off.

Product leaders, yes, like you, cringe when they hear the word integration. They're not fun for you to scope, build, launch, or maintain, and integrations probably aren't what led you to product work in the first place. Lucky for you, the folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations. Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS. Organizations like Ramp, Dorada and Electric use Merge to access their customers' accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases in their product, or HRAS data to auto-provision and deprovision access for their customers' employees. And yes, if you need AI-ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it. So want to solve your organization's integration dilemma once and for all? Book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny, and receive a $50 Amazon gift card.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:05:38):\nThanks so much for having me, Lenny. I'm super excited to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:40):\nOkay, so you are ostensibly a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, of a class called Managing Growing Enterprises. But I was reading an interview with you, and you shared that when people come ask you for advice, they're not asking, \"How do I start a company? How do I manage my growing enterprise? How do I make my company grow faster?\" Most of the questions, the most common question you get, which is surprising to me, is, \"What should I do with my life?\" First of all, is that accurate?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:06:10):\nYeah, that is accurate. About half of all the times I meet with students, that's the question they ask. It's really funny too, because sometimes they'll come with a PowerPoint presentation and a two-by-two matrix and an expected value and all that. But really they're asking the question of, \"Hey, what should I do with my life,\" which is, by the way, a great question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:29):\nWhy do you think that's the case? That's not what I would imagine someone at an MBA school in a business class asking for advice on.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:06:36):\nMy typical meeting with a student will say, the student will start to tell me about these two or three different career or job alternatives that they have, A, B and C. Let's just use two, A and B. And then they go through and they start talking about A, and they tell me all the pros and the cons of A, and they go through it. And then they go through B, and they start telling me all those things. And I start asking some questions.\n\n(00:06:56):\nAnd after about five or 10 minutes into that, I can tell that their heart and their soul and their energy is really for B. That's really what they want, but they're talking themselves out of B, and they're going to talk themselves into A. So what I try to do is, A, first, I try to let them realize that their real energy is for B, just let them feel that and understand that. And then secondly, I try to figure out, what are the limiting beliefs they have? What are the fears? What are the obstacles? What are the voices in their head? What are all the societal pressures that are keeping them from doing B? And then we try to deconstruct those and get them to go do B. So that's the process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:41):\nIs there an example of a student going ... just this actual conversation you had with someone?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:07:45):\nAbsolutely. So there's a great example of a student of mine was from Brazil. And he came in and his prior job prior to business school was he worked in consulting. And that was more or less what he wanted to do. And then at some point I asked the students, \"Okay, imagine you knew you were going to be successful and you were going to have a dream. And whatever you dreamed was going to come true, what would you dream for?\" And he wanted to start a nonprofit in his home country of Brazil to help students have more access to education. That was what came up for him.\n\n(00:08:27):\nAnd over the course of our class, we just chipped away at all the fears and limiting beliefs of why he shouldn't or couldn't do that. And by the end, that's what he did. And so that's a real life example. And there's all kinds of other examples, but that second one of going and starting a charity, it's not on the beaten path. It's not what probably your parents are thinking you should do. There's probably 100 reasons not to do it. You probably don't know exactly how to start, and so it's intimidating. But if you start with this idea, \"Hey, five years out, 10 years out, I know I'm going to be successful,\" and work backwards from that, you're going to come up with a better answer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:07):\nThis is a framework that you call the genie methodology or the genie framework, this question that you just asked that we should spend more time on, which is ... I guess, you tell the story of the genie and how to think about this [inaudible 00:09:20].",

I guess, you tell the story of the genie and how to think about this [inaudible 00:09:20].\n\nGraham Weaver (00:09:19):\nWell, when I was 13 years old, I used to listen to these motivational tapes, mowing lawns. And I'm pretty sure it was Brian Tracy had this exercise. And I've adapted it, so I'll use my exercise now. So I say basically imagine that you're walking home from work and you see this bright, shiny object. You walk over and you realize it's a magic lamp. And you rub the lamp and this genie comes out and the genie says, \"Hey, I haven't been in this bottle for 10,000 years yet, so I'm not fully formed. So I can't give you three wishes. But what I can do is I can give you one wish. And the wish I can give you is whatever you throw yourself into with your whole life and your career, it's going to turn out great. It's going to work out great. It's probably going to take longer than you think. It's going to be harder than you think, but you're going to be really happy you did and it's going to work out beyond your wildest imagination.\" If that were true and you had that genie blessing you with that wish, what would you wish for?\n\n(00:10:19):\nAnd then the students come up with an answer that's really close to their heart. It's a thing they would do, absent the fear of failure. And then the second part of the exercise is basically that's what you should go do. You should be spending your life in pursuit of your genie goal. Maybe you can't start that tomorrow; you have financial obligations, maybe there's some experience you need. But at some point in this one life we get, you want to get yourself on that path of that journey. And that's the exercise that I go through with the students.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:56):\nIt's such a simple idea, that I can totally see how it could be so powerful. And I love the way it's framed as not like it'll guarantee you'll be successful. It's instead, I'll guarantee you'll be happy.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:11:09):\nYou'll be happy that you took the path. And the reason I say that is that usually the genie goal is the not well-trodden path. So you don't even know exactly what the goal is. This charity to start education for underprivileged kids in Brazil, that takes its own form over the course of a decade. And it will almost certainly turn out differently than you think. So it's more that you'll be really happy you went and started that journey, and it will go great. It'll probably go differently and take longer than you think though.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:46):\nWhat are some other examples of genie goals folks have followed that are kind of non-traditional and they've ended up being happy about it?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:11:52):\nMine was buying companies in my dorm room at business school. I have a student who's starting an amusement park in Texas. That's a pretty crazy example. Many students who are leaving their job and doing startups. A lot of students who going in the nonprofit world. So really just lots of examples. It's as variant as the number of students I have. And that's the magic of it, because you have inside of you some really unique dream that you maybe haven't even shared. And the goal is that that's your uniqueness, and that's what you should be bringing into this world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:37):\nThis whole exercise connects to something that you're a big advocate of, this idea of getting out of autopilot mode in your life. And the way I think about it is people ... and I'm going to ask you to describe it, but just it's almost like you're driving and you've never turned off the cruise control in your car, and you don't realize it. Talk about this idea that most of us are in autopilot and why it's so important to realize that and get out of it.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:13:00):\nYou start off and you're unconscious, and you're kind of going through the motions. And you may not even realize why you're doing what you're doing or even realize what you're doing. So for example, a typical person gets up, they have whatever their morning routine ... I'll use myself. I get up out, work out, take a shower, drive into work, fight traffic, commute. I'm late. I get in, I'm late to a meeting, I'm kind of rushed meeting; meeting, meeting. Okay, quick break for lunch. Maybe I return some emails; a few more meetings, a couple of Zoom calls. Fight traffic on the way home, rush through dinner, get back on email. Go to bed. Okay, that's my day. And that's a busy day. I felt like I did a lot. I'm exhausted, but it's unconscious.\n\n(00:13:45):\nIt's not a day that is intentional. It's not a day where I've said, \"Where do I want to be going with my life? What's important to me in this world? What are my values? What 10 years from now will I wish I was starting to embark on?\" Adding that level of intentionality and then working backwards from that is really the magic of getting to that 10 years from now and looking back without regret and getting to a later point in your life and feeling like",

What 10 years from now will I wish I was starting to embark on?\" Adding that level of intentionality and then working backwards from that is really the magic of getting to that 10 years from now and looking back without regret and getting to a later point in your life and feeling like you're doing the thing you're put on the earth to do as opposed to just going through the motions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:22):\nSo the question then here is, how do you get out of that autopilot mode? Because first of all, no one really realizes this is the case. And I'll tell a quick story. We're going to different preschools and daycares for our son. He's a year and a half oldish. And we went to this Montessori school, and the teacher's like, \"I'm going to be very clear: what we're doing here is informing your child's subconscious. That's what they're learning here. And that's a huge responsibility. We put a lot of love into that idea, but it's very important you understand that's what we do at the school.\" And I never thought of it that way.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:14:56):\nThat's amazing that they said that. So you just opened up another part of this, which is depending on what research you read, somewhere between 95% and 98% of our thoughts are subconscious. And those get programmed in somehow, some way. A big part of that, by the way, is media, our friends, our parents, our boss, our coworkers, what we think we're supposed to do, social media: \"This is cool, buy this Ferrari,\" all these different things. And then you're just operating out of that. And so the idea of being intentional is create space, get out of that, get out of the fog of war, make some space. We'll probably get to this in a little bit, but I do it with an executive coach, and really ask deep questions, make space, ask questions, create the intention that you want in each of the areas of your life. And then start having your calendar reflect that intention.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:58):\nAnd so this genie exercise is one approach, is just ask yourself this question. Can you say it again just for folks so they don't miss it, what's the question you should ask yourself?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:16:08):\nI mean, the biggest question I think with respect to your career is, within reason, what would you do if you knew you wouldn't fail? That's the biggest question. I'll give you a few more if you want.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:24):\nYeah, please.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:16:26):\nDifferent questions trigger different things with people that could be helpful, trigger in a good way. So here's a few more. If you didn't have to make money, what would you do? And that'll answer what you enjoy. Naval Ravikant has a great question, which is, what's play for you that is work for other people? So for you, Lenny, that might be a podcast. That might be play for you; that's really fun. You're always going to do better at that. You're going to spend more time, you're going to enjoy it more. That's a good one.\n\n(00:17:00):\nAnother one is, what's the thing you really want to do? But you're just too embarrassed to say it? And my answer to this question was that I wanted to be a motivational speaker like Tony Robbins. And I was super embarrassed to say that, but that actually works into a lot of my life at this point. Another question, who are some people that you admire and want to be more like, and what do they do? Where do you find those people? What are some things you want to learn and how do you want to grow over the next five, 10 years? So I know a lot of your listeners are working in tech. So five, 10 years from now, you're amazing, you're best in the world at X. What's X? And how do you start to work toward becoming great at X? So there's just a few more other questions you could throw in to help you figure out some things you're excited about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:55):\nYou mentioned this idea of limiting beliefs. And I think a lot of people listening to this are probably having these beliefs right now of, \"Okay, but I have a family to support. Am I going to go start a charity in Brazil? That's absurd. It sounds easy, but I can't actually change my life this radically.\" Can you just share something to help people get past that in some way?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:18:14):\nSure. The first thing I would say about limiting beliefs is they're the most powerful and the most dangerous when you don't even know what they are. So when they're in the recesses of your subconscious mind, that is 95% of your thoughts, that's when the limiting beliefs are the most dangerous.\n\n(00:18:32):\nSo a simple example might just be like I have a limiting belief that I'm not funny. That's in my subconscious and I don't even realize I have it. So I avoid things where I'm trying to be funny or tell jokes. I mean, that's a silly example. But let's use your career now and come up with some maybe deeper ones. Let's use that charity example, the Brazilian charity, \"I'm going to start a Brazilian charity.\" What are the limiting beliefs? Well, oh my gosh, there's a million. \"",

Let's use that charity example, the Brazilian charity, \"I'm going to start a Brazilian charity.\" What are the limiting beliefs? Well, oh my gosh, there's a million. \"I don't know how to start. I don't know how I would pay for myself. I have business school debt. I don't really know what I'm even talking about. I don't even have a plan for it. How would I get funding?\" Those are all these things that are flooding your mind.\n\n(00:19:15):\nSo the first exercise is just write all that down. Just get it down on paper, and then two things will happen. One is when you get it down on paper, it will almost immediately strip that limiting belief of a lot of its power and a lot of its scariness. Because now it's just something like, for example, \"How would I fund this?\" So the second thing that is that a lot of that scariness becomes just a to-do item. In the recesses of your subconscious, that is a very scary, limiting belief that will actually keep you from doing the thing you love. Once it's on paper, now it's just a to-do item that you can actually deal with with your conscious mind, just like you do anything else. So, \"How would I fund this,\" just becomes a plan, like, \"I need to design a plan where I'd get funding for this charity.\" And then that just is a problem like any other problem. It's not this nebulous, scary fear. It's just literally a to-do item.\n\n(00:20:14):\nSo the first part of limiting beliefs, write them down, understand what they are, look at them in the cold day of light on paper, and then translate them into things that are just obstacles to be overcome. And by the way, if you're listening to this podcast, you've overcome millions of obstacles in your life, and these are no different once they're down on paper.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:34):\nAre you actually doing these exercises with your students? They're taking a class about growing their enterprise and then it's like, \"Okay, let's analyze what you want to do with your life\"? Is that how this class goes?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:20:42):\nThat's a really good question. So I'll give you a little bit of background. So I was a case guest at Stanford Business School while I was buying companies in my dorm room. And it was talking about all the things that went wrong. And so it's kind of a really fun case. And I did that for 12 years. And I started to realize that was my most energetic day of the year. And so long story short, I started teaching a class full time. So I did that for four years. And I was teaching the Xs and Os of being a CEO, basically: hiring, firing, having hard conversations, managing a board, fundraising, selling, all the things you would imagine that a young CEO would need to know.\n\n(00:21:20):\nAfter about four years, I started to realize that was great, except that no one went and did it. So the class is on entrepreneurship, and they learned how to be an entrepreneur. There was only one problem: they didn't actually become entrepreneurs. So then I said, \"Well, wait a sec. I have to readjust my class a little bit, and I have to spend some time on the stuff we've just been talking about: finding out what your dream is, your limiting beliefs, starting to map out goals toward your actual entrepreneurship dream or whatever your genie goal is.\"\n\n(00:21:53):\nSo the way I say it is the university allows me to teach the class because I teach them entrepreneurial tricks, tactics, tools that will help them become a great CEO. But the real reason I teach is because I'm trying to help people really go find the thing that they're excited about and get into the life path of doing that thing. So I do both, but I do the second one kind of ... maybe that's not the headline of the course, although I think that's probably why people like the course so much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:30):\nIt's like a Trojan horse element.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:22:32):\nExactly, yeah. Tony Robbins used to say that people hire him for success, and he has to give them that so that he feels like he earned his money, but what he really delivers them is fulfillment. And it's a little bit like that. People take my class to learn how to be a CEO, but what they really get is hopefully on the path of doing the thing they want to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:54):\nA lot of what you've been talking about, it's almost an assumption that you'll be more successful and happier if you follow your energy, your passion, versus the, \"Here's how I'll make a bunch of money. Here's how I'll move up the ladder.\" Can you speak to that?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:23:09):\nYeah. Gosh, Lenny, it sounds so cliche when you say it like that, that I almost cringe a little bit. Let me try to give it a little bit different framework where it won't sound as ... because cliches are cliches because they're true. But let me try to give you a little bit different framework to think about it.\n\n(00:23:29):\nI think about it as you have sort of your heart or your soul or your internal scorecard",

But let me try to give you a little bit different framework to think about it.\n\n(00:23:29):\nI think about it as you have sort of your heart or your soul or your internal scorecard, and then you have your head and your mind and the world's external scorecard. And I'll speak from this from experience. So when I graduated from business school, I took the job I was supposed to take. And it was the safe job at the big private equity firm that paid well and looked great on my resume. And I took that job. That was the external scorecard. My head said that. I built an expected value calculation, all that stuff.\n\n(00:24:02):\nThe problem was it wasn't my internal scorecard. It had nothing to do with what I actually cared about and wanted to do with my life. And so the way that shows up is just this tension, friction, stress, anxiety, burnout, all those things. And you can will that, you can will yourself through for long periods of time. In fact, if you want, you can will yourself through that your whole life.\n\n(00:24:31):\nBut then once I got into the path of the thing that I was excited about, that's when I really felt my energy change dramatically. And I developed almost a superpower in that thing, because I had more energy. I was willing to work longer, I was willing to do it. I've been running my company now for 23 years. I was willing to do it for a longer period of time. I thought about it in the shower. I thought about it when I went on runs. I talked to people. They wanted to join because I was excited. And it was a whole different level of power and life force that I was able to bring to that.\n\n(00:25:14):\nSo I'm saying this from experience, that you're going to show up so much differently in the thing that you're excited about, that that alone is going to make your life a lot better. But the great irony is you're going to do so much better in that thing than you are the thing you are, quote, \"supposed to do.\" And I certainly, certainly understand that people have real life constraints on their finances. And I 100% get that. And so a big part of what I do with students is work through those things and say, \"Okay, great. Let's talk about this job you're going to take for X years and you're going to pay off your loans or whatever. But during that time, let's get you on the path of the thing you really want to do.\" So sometime soon in your life, you want to get on that path.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:02):\nThere's a bunch of directions I want to go here. One is I'll just share, what you're describing is exactly what happened to me, without knowing this advice. I just started writing things online because the poll was there and people seemed to enjoy it. So I just kept following that path. And the whole time, my wife's like, \"You can't make money writing on the internet. That's not a thing. Why would you do this? You have all these skills, that you can make a lot more doing other things.\" But I just kept doing that, and that's what led me to this life now where I make much, much more than I made as a product manager at Airbnb. And also, it's a lot less stressful. And so, I'm a living example [inaudible 00:26:39].\n\nGraham Weaver (00:26:38):\nYeah. And if you go back to what I was saying before, you probably were answering the question, \"What would I do if I didn't have to make money?\" You just did that because you enjoyed it. What's play for you that's work for other people? What do you do in your free time? You were answering all those questions. And then I think a lot of people just say, \"Oh, well, that's just a side hustle or a hobby.\" It is until it isn't, right? And you're a great example of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:04):\nJust to set it some expectations with folks, you tell me, how often does this actually work out for someone where this ended up being the right path for them, that it ended up working well for them? Just because people can hear this and be like, \"Yeah, okay, I'm sure it works for some people; probably not for most people.\" What's the success rate, however you define that, for your students?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:27:25):\nOkay, so the short answer is I don't know, because I don't have full information about how my students do or what their path would have been had they not done it. So it's a kind of difficult question to answer. But what I would say is that the formula you're solving for is you, excited about something for a decade or more. So what has to happen? You excited about something. We just talked about what that is. The decade or more is going to come true more likely if you're excited about it. But also, you have to go in at the beginning with that mindset and the structural ability to stay at it for a long period of time. So the missing ingredient in most of the people that fail is time.\n\n(00:28:18):\nAnd I'll use myself as an example. I started Alpine. We lost money on our first fund. We started doing well. We got hit",

So the missing ingredient in most of the people that fail is time.\n\n(00:28:18):\nAnd I'll use myself as an example. I started Alpine. We lost money on our first fund. We started doing well. We got hit by the recession, we started digging out, whatever. But long story short, I was 14 years into running my firm until I could say with confidence we were going to even stay in business, let alone be really successful. And probably 18 years until we were what I would say really successful by external standards. And now 23 years, we've had a great run. But if you take away the time period, then I would've gone down as one of the, quote, \"failures,\" as opposed to, I would say, one of the success stories using this methodology.\n\n(00:29:10):\nSo time is the variable. And I think the biggest part of that is it's really, believe it or not, not typically the finance or the structural piece. It's the entrepreneur or the individual's willingness to actually stay with it. And then upstream of that, it's their belief about how long it's supposed to take. And I really hate this about the social media and just media in general, where they try to paint this picture that things are going to happen overnight. And we've invested in 600 businesses. Let's say 550 of those are founder-started businesses where we're the first money. I've never, in one of those examples, seen anyone who did something quickly. They've all been very, very long stories to get to that point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:12):\nThis reminds me of a quote I read. I don't know if you wrote this or you shared it, this idea that the life is suffering, so choose something worth suffering for.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:30:20):\nI wrote that, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:22):\nYou wrote that. Talk about that, because it feels like it's exactly what you're describing. It's going to take a long time to figure something out.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:30:28):\nExactly. Yeah, exactly. I'm glad you brought that ... Yeah, I mean, think about it. Again, using myself as an example, the first job I had, I wasn't suffering any less. I was getting on planes, I was working late hours. My time was not my own. If I would've had kids, I'd be missing their little league games and all that stuff. So I'm doing that anyway. I'm just doing it for something I don't care about. And then I start my own company and I was, quote, \"suffering,\" getting on planes, doing all that. It was just something that I cared about. So yeah, the quote, \"Life is suffering. So figure out something worth suffering for,\" you're going to suffer either way. And that's another thing I think people don't realize, is there isn't really a path that is easy that I've ever found.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:16):\nYou have another quote along these lines, which is, \"Everything you want is on the other side of worse first.\"\n\nGraham Weaver (00:31:21):\nYeah, I mean, I know those are two non-super optimistic quotes perhaps, but I think they're true. The second one, everything you want is on the other side of worst first, and this is something where I almost can't think of many exceptions to this. Pick anything. You want a better body? Okay, you're going to need to go to the gym. When you go to the gym the first few times, it's going to not be that fun. You're going to set your alarm, you're going to get sore. It's not going to be great. You're going to have to probably make some changes to your diet. That's not going to be fun, at least initially. And so that's one example.\n\n(00:32:05):\nYou want to change careers, you're going to have to learn a new career. You're going to have to leave your career. You're going to have to maybe interview for new jobs, or whatever it is. In each case, the first move is negative. The first move is negative to getting in shape. The first move is negative to get out of a bad relationship, to get into a career you want to be in. The reason I think that's important to say is because if I'm optimizing for tomorrow and I just want to have a great day tomorrow, I'm going to stay exactly where I am, because my life will be better tomorrow if I don't make any changes. I don't have to break up with my girlfriend, have a hard conversation, have the tears, be alone, go on dating apps. I don't have to do that if I just stay in it one more day.\n\n(00:32:55):\nSo if you realize this and instead ask the question, the version of myself five years from now, what would they wish I was going to do right now? So I can guarantee your five-year version of yourself will say, \"Get out of that toxic relationship, no matter how painful it is for the next two months.\" And if you can make decisions from that, and then on top of that, realize it's going to get worse first, then that's why I say everything you want is on the other side of worse first. But if you don't do that, you just end up plateauing. And so many people I see have this happen where they hit a plateau and they never move past it because they're not willing to have that hard day,",

It makes me think of parenting advice, some parenting advice I recently saw. Dr. Becky has this advice of your job as a parent isn't to make your kids happy, but it's to make them resilient.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:34:02):\nI love that, yeah. By the way, watch how people parent. They parent exactly the opposite of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:07):\nExactly [inaudible 00:34:09].\n\nGraham Weaver (00:34:09):\nYou and I both live in Marin. I don't know if you have kids or how old they are, but when you get kids in school in Marin, you see parents, they try to clear all obstacles away from their kids. It's the worst thing you could do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:25):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Liveblocks, the platform that turns your product into a place that users want to be.

Okay, this is great.\" I'm going to share this in intro, and we're not going to talk a lot about your fund, but I did some research on it. And from what I understand, it's one of the top performing PE funds in the world, which is very hard, considering how many smart people run PE funds and how ruthless that industry is. Anything you can comment on there? Yeah, I think that's important for people to know.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:35:48):\nWell, I think one of the things I would say is that I never stand up in front of students or be on a podcast like this and say anything that I'm not doing myself or that I'm advising students or people who work at Alpine to do. And so I appreciate the kind words. And I think that the things that I'm talking about are rooted in real results. And this is not just happy talk podcast. The formula, I think, for greatness is to be intentional, get in the path of the thing that you're most excited about, and then give yourself several decades to do it. And that's based on investing in 600 companies and building my own business. So I appreciate the kind call out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:37):\nYeah. For people that are listening and be like, \"Okay, I'm motivated. I want to do this,\" other than taking your class, anything you can recommend to just do these sorts of exercises, ask yourself these questions that you've seen work?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:36:49):\nI mean, the answer is accountability. How do you keep yourself accountable to living the life you want to live? And the analogy I would use is let's say that your number one goal in life is you've got to get in better shape. You just have to. Let's say you have even medically, you're going to have real health problems if you don't do that. I would say you hire yourself a personal trainer, pay what you need to pay. Okay, maybe you don't have a ton of money, but that's where I'd spend it. That person, A, they're going to hold you accountable to showing up at a certain time, and B, they're going to show you the exercises. They're going to call you if you're not there. You're just increasing the chances of success. Plus you spend some money, you want to get your money out of it.\n\n(00:37:40):\nThe equivalent of that in your life is an executive coach. And I figured this out in 2009 in the dark recesses of the recession. I hired my first executive coach. And I was like, \"Wow, it's a personal trainer for me for two things.\" Number one, make space to ask yourself the big questions in life about your career, your relationships, your health, your spirituality, your children. Whatever the big things are in your life, ask the big questions, find out what your intention is. What are you looking for in those areas? And just have, in my case, several hours a week to get clear on those things. Okay, so that's part one.\n\n(00:38:25):\nAnd then part two is that person can hold you accountable. I have one coach that I can't even have the call with the coach unless I fill out a piece of paper or an online form that says, \"Here's what",

I have one coach that I can't even have the call with the coach unless I fill out a piece of paper or an online form that says, \"Here's what my one year goals are, outcomes I want to have this year are. Here's what I did last week, based on those. Here's what I'm going to do next week toward those. And here's the outcomes I want to have for the call we're about to have.\" And even if I never had the call, just having to fill that out every single week is incredibly powerful and allows me to hold myself accountable.\n\n(00:39:03):\nSo 100%, that's what I'd recommend. Let's back up and say, okay, let's say you can't afford a coach or you're worried about that. And this is the same thing as, let's say you couldn't afford a personal trainer. I would give you the same advice, which is find a very like-minded friend of yours and sit down and do it for each other. So if you're using the workout example, okay, you're going to go on a run Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays with your friend, and they're going to meet you at 7:00 AM at this trail, or 6:00 AM at this trail. That's your accountability. And you're going to be more likely to do it. You don't want to let them down. They're going to beat you up if you don't get there.\n\n(00:39:44):\nSame is true with this. This is how I started. I did this with my roommate in business school. And we would go on a walk for 30 minutes and talk about my dreams and hopes. Then we'd turn around and talk about his. And it was great, because we made room for each other to have those conversations, and we also developed a great friendship. So short of having an actual executive coach, find a really-minded person that could get into this with you, and that would be another thing. But accountability is huge. I'm going to just say one more thing. I'm sorry. I'm going on a little bit long on this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:20):\n[inaudible 00:40:20] please.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:40:19):\nThere's another thing that happens that's kind of magical, which is you activate a different part of your brain when you talk. You actually activate more of your brain when you talk than when you think or write. So thinking activates the least amount of your brain. Writing is a little bit better, but talking activates a whole different region of your brain. So that's the other big benefit of not doing this just on your own, is being able to talk about it with someone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:54):\nI love that there's a whole spectrum of ways to create accountability for yourself. I love the second coach you've shared, where just filling out that form was basically the biggest benefit.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:41:07):\nI learned this from these audio tapes. When I was in college, I had this green notebook. And I was trying to row crew, and I never row crew before. And I wrote down at the top of the page every single morning, I wrote down, \"I am the number one rower in the country.\" I wasn't. I was a freshman novice, 135 pound Midwesterner, never had been in a boat. But I wrote that down. And then I wrote down three things I was going to do that day to move toward that goal. And I did that every single day that I was in college. And it's just incredible. We talked earlier about your subconscious mind. You're just locking your subconscious mind into your goals and where you want to go and who you want to be and how you want to show up. It's really powerful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:46):\nAnd that's advice anybody can implement. \"I want to be the best [inaudible 00:41:51] founder\"-\n\nGraham Weaver (00:41:50):\nYou could do that. You could do that [inaudible 00:41:50] exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:53):\nYeah. It's such a simple thing. \"I want to be the best product manager. Here's three things I'm doing today to help me along the lines.\"\n\nGraham Weaver (00:41:59):\nAbsolutely. My students have to do this twice a week. It's one of their assignments, and they actually have to turn it in. And I have so many students that say five years later, \"I still do this a couple times a week, and it's been unbelievable.\" I'd say this to all your listeners: you will get more done writing down your goal and three things you're going to do to move toward that goal, you'll get more things done in three months than you will in three years without that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:28):\nThat's an awesome thing to just try tomorrow at work. Write this down, see how it goes. The coach point, I just want to highlight that. What convinced me to get a coach back when I was working is I just realized, one, every athlete has a coach that tells them, \"Here's how to become better,\" slash, everyone that you work with that is a leader and exec basically has a coach. And the people that have an exec coach will do better in their career and life than those who don't. So why",

It just makes so much sense if you can afford it. There are different price points for different coaches. Most people can probably afford it in some [inaudible 00:43:09].\n\nGraham Weaver (00:43:08):\nThat's right. That's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:11):\nSweet. Okay. Let's talk about another framework that you have that you call nine lives. And this is essentially another way, it's like another way to hack your brain to come up with things you really should be doing, probably. Talk about this exercise.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:43:23):\nSo this idea of what's my passion and what's my career goal, it can be really intimidating. And it is intimidating. And so this exercise is to make it less intimidating. And you basically come up with nine lives. So you say your first life, life one is the life you have now. So when I did this exercise ... let's pretend I did this exercise when I'm right out of school, taking that job. So life one is I'm working at this big firm, I live in the Bay Area, here's what I'm doing. That's life one.\n\n(00:44:05):\nThere's two rules. The first rule is all the lives have to start from today. So you can't go back in time. They all start from today. And the second rule is you have to be excited about all these lives. So I might say, \"Hey, my second life is I want to start a private equity firm and be a founder and be a CEO.\" And that's life too. And life three is I want to be an author and I want to write whatever fiction or nonfiction. And then life four would be I want to be a professor and teach. And life five is maybe I want to make videos and be on social media. And life six, I want to be an actor. And you go through this whole list of these lives.\n\n(00:44:43):\nAnd the idea is that ... A couple of things from this exercise. One is let's say that you're in a position where you need to be working in the job you're in. There might be one of these lives that gives you the most energy, and it's the thing if you knew you wouldn't fail, you would do this one. And it's good to recognize what that is and then pull that life a little bit into your current life.\n\n(00:45:10):\nSo let's say, Lenny, that you were a product manager, but you really loved doing podcasts, and that was one of your nine lives. Do a podcast every other week, and just pull it into your life, which it sounds like what you did. You started doing it as a side hustle. And then that'll have two amazing effects. One is you will just have more energy everywhere else in your life. Forget if you ever do this full time or not; just the act of pulling something into your life you're really excited about will give you a tremendous amount of energy.\n\n(00:45:45):\nAnd then the second thing is you'll ideally find the path that is the thing that gives you the most energy. The other thing that I've learned in doing this exercise is you actually can have pretty much all nine lives. You can't have them at once, but if you're fortunate enough to live long enough, you can have all of these things. So I have had the corporate job, been the founder, been the professor, been a writer, had videos, taught people. I've been able to bring most of those lives into this current life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:25):\nThere's a couple things there that come up as you talk about. One is, on that point, what I do now is my fourth career. First I was an engineer, then I became a founder, then I was a PM, and now I do whatever the heck this is. And I think people don't realize that's how life often goes. You think you're going to do one thing, and then you have many different careers that pivot into [inaudible 00:46:46].\n\nGraham Weaver (00:46:45):\nExactly. And I think that's the thing. It's just trying to make it a little less intimidating. You don't have to have this one life purpose, passion, thing that you do for the rest of your life. If you just follow the thing that gives you energy at each time, it'll probably be a good indication of where you want to be going.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:03):\nThe other thread there is, I know one of your other really important pieces of advice is to avoid this not now idea, where everyone's like, \"Here's the thing I should be doing, my genie goal, but not now.\" Thoughts on just how to think about that, of just like, \"Okay, I know I have these lives I could live, but not now,\" on this or that?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:47:21):\nYeah, I mean, in 20 years of teaching, I've never had a student come to me and say, \"Hey, Graham, my real dream is to do X, but I'm just going to give up on it. I'm not going to do it.\" No",

I'm not going to do it.\" No one's ever said that. Instead, they say, \"Not now.\" And not now, if they're not careful, will turn into not ever, because not now is just really another way of saying, \"I'm not going to do it.\" And then there's a million reasons why you can't do it now. And those reasons, some of them are legit and some of them are just fear in another form.\n\n(00:47:58):\nIn terms of how to overcome that, I think it's kind of hopeful to realize that it's never really the right time. When you're making a change or you're going to go do something different, it's never going to feel secure and safe. You're always going to have some fear. You're always going to feel like you're not ready. You're going to feel like it's too soon. You're going to feel like you don't know exactly what that path looks like. And so just understanding that's normal. That's called entrepreneurship. That's called life. And if you wait for the clouds to part and this ray of sun to come down and say, \"Now is the time,\" you're going to wait your whole life.\n\n(00:48:43):\nAnd so I think that realization can maybe be helpful. And then try to figure out, what are the things that need to be true for you to launch? And usually for my students, it's something financial that is the big bottleneck. And what I tell them is, \"You know what? People have raised money to start a business before. That's happened, where you've had people who've started businesses without their own money that have been able to pay themselves. And that's not a reason to not do it. It's an obstacle. It's something you have to solve, but it's not not an insurmountable obstacle.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:30):\nThis touches on a quote I definitely wanted to get to, something that you wrote not long ago. Here's the quote: \"The most important thing I've learned in the first 50 years of my life is that the true game of life is an internal one, not an external one. And that journey starts with three powerful words: I am enough.\" Talk about that. Why is that so important?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:49:51):\nWell, I mean, that's a really a deep topic, but I'll talk about the internal and external journey. So life presents itself as a series of external obstacles and events. And it feels very much like an external journey. And it can feel that way your whole life. But I think what you'll realize, and I started realizing this when I really started meditating and spending time distancing myself from the subconscious thoughts, is a very, very large part of life is internal. I say a very large part because obviously you need some food, clothing, shelter, some basic needs that are external. But for most people that have the ability to even listen to this podcast, I would say the vast majority of your life is internal.\n\n(00:50:52):\nSo what do I mean by that? I mean that you're writing a story about what it is you think you need to be happy, or you're writing a story about things you think you need to be to be enough or to be respected or to feel worthy or to get admiration of other people. You're writing that story, and it's just a story. And if you really follow this logic, you'll realize that. You'll realize it is 100% just a story, or it's a story that you should even care. And then that opens up a lot more agency that you have over deciding what is important to you, what is your internal scorecard, what are the things that matter to you, not what the external world thinks or the story you've been writing for a long time. When you start to open this up, it's really kind of scary at first, because you'll start to realize most of the things you're operating from are really just stories that have been written at some point in your life. And so it's actually terrifying at first, and then it starts to become really liberating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:10):\nWas there an example of that in your life? Because externally, it feels like you're killing it: a killer PE fund, teaching at Stanford. The scorecard is looking good. So it's interesting you say that.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:52:21):\nThe first time I really realized this, it was in 2015. I mentioned to you it took me 14 years to be successful. So we had just sold the last company from our second fund, which is where we really got paid. I had a financial event that was ... it wasn't like I never have to work again in my life. It was just like I could exhale a little bit. I knew I was going to be able to pay my mortgage and put my kids through college. It was that kind of an event. And for a couple days I was euphoric, because I felt like I'd worked so hard for this. I'd been, again, at this for 15 years, but really longer than that, if you go back to getting into college. And the whole thing had been a long journey.\n\n(00:53:05):\nAnd then it hit me that nothing changed. Nothing internally changed at all. I still had the same problems. I still felt the same way",

And the whole thing had been a long journey.\n\n(00:53:05):\nAnd then it hit me that nothing changed. Nothing internally changed at all. I still had the same problems. I still felt the same way about myself. I still had a lot of negative thoughts about myself. This goal that I thought that I had for this whole long period of time, it didn't actually change anything. It changed externally, for sure. Like I said, I could exhale and pay my mortgage. And those are all really good things. But that was the first time when I realized, \"Oh, wait a second. It's really up to me to find things that are going to give me joy. And the achievement of some kind of external event is not one of those things.\"\n\n(00:53:54):\nAnd I know that sounds really, really weird, but there's so many people that I've heard that have had very, very similar stories. And so it was really disorienting for me. And actually it was the first time in my life where I experienced depression, because I just had this thought of, \"I think I was working my whole life for that, and it wasn't what I thought it was going to be.\" And so now I was thinking, \"Well, what is it then? What is the thing that's going to give me joy?\" And that takes some introspection to ask those questions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:34):\nI was just having a conversation with a friend who's an angel investor, and he just had a bunch of exits. And he's like, \"Cool, I got some money in my bank account now, but I don't feel anything. I thought I'd be like, 'Holy moly, this is exactly what I was hoping for. And nothing changed.'\" Exactly how you're describing.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:54:53):\nI think you get a little bit of peace of mind when you have some financial security, which is valuable. But in terms of now my life changes, now I'm enough, now I am happy, now I feel good about myself, none of that changes, for really anybody that I know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:15):\nAnd the hardest part, as you said, is you think it will. You think, \"Oh, I'll be so happy once I achieve this thing.\" And I think an example of this is there's a lot of miserable billionaires, from what I've read and see. And that should tell you a lot.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:55:26):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:27):\nMaybe a second-to-last question; I'm curious if there's anything recently you're focused on, have been thinking a lot about that maybe you changed your mind about, or has changed the way you think about the world?\n\nGraham Weaver (00:55:38):\nThe last two years, I had my two oldest boys go off to college, 2022 and then 2024. And that really hit hard. You would think that I would've been preparing for that for 18 years for each of them, but for some reason it just really hit me really, really hard. And I think it was a real wake up call of mortality, I guess, and to realize that nothing goes on forever. And these wonderful people that I had lived with, each for 18 years, were no longer going to really be a part of my daily life.\n\n(00:56:17):\nAnd that really set me off on a journey of a lot of spiritual work, doing a lot of meditating and working with some gurus. And it's been really profound. And it's put me a lot closer in touch with the things that really matter to me. I've given myself more permission to spend time doing those things than the normal external world type things. So that was a pretty profound change for me. And the spiritual journey is arguably really the important journey. And this could be a longer conversation. And maybe you have the luxury of doing that journey as you get older or something, but it's been a really profound, profound journey.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:17):\nI'm excited to see what insights come out of this part of your life. Final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. We have this segment on the podcast called Failure Corner, where people come on this podcast, they share all these wins: \"Oh, I have this amazing PE fund that's killing it. I teach at Stanford. I've launched all these things. All these students, they're so great. Life's amazing. Nothing ever goes wrong,\" when in reality, it does. And those stories often aren't told. So I'm curious if there's a story you could share of a time you failed in your career and, if you learned something from that experience, what you learned.\n\nGraham Weaver (00:57:51):\nYeah, I'll tell a couple stories. So when I was in high school, I wrestled. And I cut a lot of weight to make the varsity team. And I was not in the best mental place because of cutting weight. But anyway, I lost a big match my junior year. And I quit and I never wrestled again. And that haunted me. So first of all, that was a failure, a big failure for me. And it really haunted me. And so I, after that, made a promise to myself that it wasn't going to have that happen again. When I went to college, I tried to row crew. I failed year",

When I went to college, I tried to row crew. I failed year after year trying to make the team, trying to make the boat. Eventually had some real success my senior year, but prior to that, just failure after failure.\n\n(00:58:44):\nAnd then at Alpine, I mean, we lost money on our first fund. We had real trouble during the recession. I think five of my first eight investments I ever made in my life, I lost money. And in venture world, that's one thing, but in private equity, that's a whole different ratio, which is not a good ratio at all. When I first started teaching, I wasn't good at teaching, had a lot of insecurities. I was really young when I started, and I didn't feel like I had really anything to share with the students. And I think that showed up, and it took me a long time to kind of figure that out.\n\n(00:59:26):\nSo I guess almost my entire track record is one that starts with things not going well, and then just over a long period of time of chipping away, looks like a success on paper. But anytime early in the process would look like an abject failure. So I'm quite familiar with failure in the form of setbacks. I think the ultimate failure though was the wrestling one, where I just quit. That was really the only one I would characterize as a failure. The other ones, because I kept going and staying with it, turned out to work out well, with a lot of scars and bruises, but the failure would've been quitting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:15):\nI love that the circles back to your core advice of stick with it. Most things that are important take a long time and there's a lot of suffering [inaudible 01:00:24].\n\nGraham Weaver (01:00:24):\nYeah, they do. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:26):\nSomething I wanted to ask, I can't help but ask at this point, because I think a lot of people are wondering this, just when do you quit? When should you quit something? Because some things are just not worth it. Is there any advice there you could share?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:00:37):\nYes, for sure. I think the time to quit is when you can no longer see the vision and you can no longer really believe the vision. And then when that happens for a long period of time ... or maybe you're no longer even excited about the vision; somewhere in there, I think. The excited one, you have to be a little careful of, because in the dark days, exciting is not the word you're going to use. But at least in our company, for the first 10 years it was not going well. But each time, we'd make fewer mistakes, we'd start to see something working. We'd do one really good deal in this fund, we'd start to learn from that. We'd get one really good hire, we'd learn from that. We would little by little start to see these green shoots.\n\n(01:01:24):\nAnd I have this unbelievable statement. I didn't write it. Dan and Chip Heath wrote it in their book, Switch, which is \"Scale your bright spots. Find what's working and do more of that.\" And as you start to progress, for me, for example, at Alpine, almost all the time, we always had at least a small glimmer of a bright spot. And then we'd scale that and then we'd continue forward and we'd find some more and we'd scale those. And over time, all those bright spots became our business. That became what we did. That became our strategy. That became how we hired people. That became where we recruited from. All those bright spots just started to magnify until the entire business was pretty much a bright spot. But it took time, because we had to figure out where those were. And we had to do a lot of things wrong to figure out where the bright spots were.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:19):\nGraham, is there anything else that you wanted to share or you think is important to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:02:25):\nI mean, I think what I would say is just in general, you got one life, you get one shot. And so take the time to really figure out and answer the question, what does a wonderful, amazing, incredible life look like? And just get as clear as you possibly can on that. No matter how crazy or aspirational it seems, write it down. Write down that thing is write down that thing that would make this life amazing. And write it down for your life, your career, your relationships, your friends, your body, your spirituality, your financial situation. And just the first magic is just knowing what you want. And I'd say 90% of people never even know what they want. So take the time to do that. And the more clear you are on that, the more invested you are in that, the more likely you are to make it come true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:18):\nWhat I love about that is you don't have to do this thing, just step one is understand what it could be if you could do that.\n\nG",

Oh, man. Okay. Well, with that, Graham, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:03:37):\nLet's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:39):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:03:44):\nSo in the realm of a lot of the topics we've been talking about, which is your internal and external game, I love the book Untethered Soul. And I love the book, Don't Believe Everything You Think. They have very similar themes, but they come at it differently. But I think both of those will really change your perspective if you read them.\n\n(01:04:08):\nAnd then a very, very practical book that's probably the book I've read more than any other book, is How to Win Friends and Influence People, by Dale Carnegie, which was written in like 1930. There's no other book it. There's a reason that people are still recommending it 100 years after it's written. So it's definitely worth checking out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):\nYeah, that book, I still think about it often, even though I read it 30 years ago at this point. I love that recommendation. And it's like a very old book to read, but you have to get past the fact that it was written a long time ago. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:04:48):\nI, for the first time, watched the movie Where the Crawdads Sing. And I just loved it. It's kind of a romantic comedy, or not comedy, sorry, romantic love story meets murder mystery, meets coming of age. And it really, really touched me. Then I promptly read the book as well, so I love that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:14):\nDo you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:05:17):\nI'm a really big fan of sleep. I think it makes a massive difference in your life. And that's a whole other topic we could go down another time. So I have a few things that have helped me on that. So if you saw me sleeping, I have earplugs, I have a noise machine. I have a sleep mask, and then I have a Chilipad that goes on my bed to keep the bed cool. And I sleep great. All those things really help. The earplugs and mask and noise machine allow you to not hear the ambient noise. And then there's a lot of research actually on the temperature at which you want to sleep. And your body goes up and down throughout the night. So this Chilipad that goes under your mattress, there's a whole bunch of versions of that. And that helps a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:11):\nI also sleep with an eye mask. My wife and I rotate the earplugs, because someone has to pay attention to the baby, in case he wakes up.\n\nGraham Weaver (01:06:18):\nThere you go. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:20):\nAnd this Chilipad, is this the Eight Sleep, or is this in just a cold bag?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:06:24):\nWell, no. So I actually bought the Eight Sleep, and it was too much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:27):\nYeah, it's a lot.\n\nGraham Weaver (01:06:28):\nIt would turn on and off. And I would wake up. And then it would track my sleep, and then I'd start to freak out because it'd tell me I wasn't sleeping well. So I actually returned it and I got a really simple one called OOLER. And it just turns on and off. There's no timing. There's no any weird functionality. And it was a lot cheaper, and it works better for me. So everyone use their own thing, but that one worked better for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:55):\nOkay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about that you find useful in work or in life?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:07:02):\nI love this quote that sums up a lot of what we talked about in the podcast. It's by Howard Thurman. And he says, \"Don't ask what the world needs. Ask instead what makes you come alive, because what the world needs most is for you to come alive.\" And I think that just talks about it's really about you coming alive that's the most important thing. And that is going to have so much positive exhaust in the world. And things from that will come that you can't even imagine right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:38):\nI was thinking of that quote as you were describing your philosophy. Final question. I feel like a lot of people",

I feel like a lot of people might be listening to this being like, \"I came here for one of the most legendary private equity investors of all time, and you don't talk about private equity at all.\" So let me just use this opportunity to ask you just a question here. What do you look for in a company that you want to buy that maybe other people don't? Is there some insight you could share?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:08:04):\nYeah. Well, I'm happy to talk about private equity, by the way. It's just that we talked-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:10):\nWe'll do another episode on that. This could be a whole podcast episode. I understand.\n\nGraham Weaver (01:08:13):\nReally happy to talk about that about. So I'll answer the question more like, what's a little bit of a different philosophy that we have? So when we were coming out of the recession and I hired this coach, we looked at all of our companies. And we were looking for where did we make our most money, and what was the most consistent trend? And we looked at valuation, growth rates, capital structure, geography, industry. We cut the data every way you could imagine. And we had these three companies that kept showing up on all these lists that were three of our top performers, but they didn't seem to really have anything in common.\n\n(01:08:53):\nAnd then we're like, \"Well, they have one thing in common, which is they started off really badly, so badly in fact that we put our own person from Alpine in to go run the company, and then they ended up becoming our best companies.\" So we said, \"Wait a second. Maybe that's the highly correlated thing, is us putting our own team in place, and even upstream of that, maybe just having an incredible management team.\" So that was foundational. And now, we put our own leadership team in 100% of the time. And not only that, but we have spent an inordinate amount of time trying to build a program to help people who are in their late 20s, early 30s learn how to become CEOs. And that's been foundational.\n\n(01:09:38):\nSo the thing that we probably believe to be true that not that many people agree with us on is that the management team is really where we think all the alpha comes from. You can't get the industry wrong, because if you hire the best management team in the world to run a typewriter business, you're going to lose money. So you can't be wrong on the industry, but you also don't have to be perfect on the industry. You have to have a good enough industry and then a world-class management team. And we found that to be a really good formula for consistent returns. And it's way more fun because you're literally in a board meeting with someone that is on your side of the table, because you hired them and put them in. And so you're building the company together. And they're bringing a lot of similar values. And so it's been a real differentiator for us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:32):\nI have so many questions, but I'm going to cut it off there. We could do another episode going deep on all this. Graham, this was amazing. I think we're going to be helping a lot of people with what they want to do with their lives, and if nothing else, give them a little opportunity to break out of autopilot, at least for a little bit. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to maybe follow up, ask maybe some other questions that they are thinking as they hear this? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nGraham Weaver (01:10:56):\nMy website's grahamweaver.com, and I have a blog on there as well as a lot of videos and different things. And then on Instagram and TikTok, I'm grahamcweaver. And then on LinkedIn, I'm Graham Weaver. And on YouTube, I think I'm Graham C. Weaver. So Graham C. Weaver will pretty much get you on all those channels.\n\n(01:11:16):\nHow can listeners be helpful? I would say I'd love to hear from you. So my best way to reach me is grahamweaverblog.com. And tell me what's on your mind. I may not respond 100%, but I will read all the emails. And then if you're interested, subscribe to my blog. So go to my website, grahamweaver.com, and I have a blog where I talk about a lot of the topics that we're talking about today.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:44):\nAmazing. Graham, thank you so much for being here.\n\nGraham Weaver (01:11:45):\nThank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:46):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

Product in the tech industry is something different.\" I just said, \"Listen, let's get some older people who are hosts in here.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):\nThis whole story is a really good example of the value of having folks that are older.\n\nChip Conley (00:00:45):\nWhen you have older brains connecting the dots, younger team members being really fast and focused, it's brilliant, and people won't notice your wrinkles as much as they'll notice your energy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):\nThe Airbnb experienced led you to starting something called the Modern Elder Academy.\n\nChip Conley (00:00:59):\nIf you think about the caterpillar to butterfly journey, midlife is the chrysalis. Midlife is not crisis. I'm happier today at 64 than I was at 47 when I was going through my flatline experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:09):\nWell, let's back up a little bit, this near death experience. Today, my guest is Chip Conley. Chip is one of the most extraordinary and interesting people that you'll ever meet. He was a founding member of the board of Burning Nan. He was on the board of the Esalen Institute in Big Sur. At 26, he started a hotel chain called Joie de Vivre, which went on to become the second-largest boutique hotel chain in the US.\n\n(00:01:32):\nAfter selling it, Brian Chesky personally recruited Chip to join Airbnb to help Brian and the company transform from a fast-growing startup to the world's most valuable hospitality brand. After leaving Airbnb where he was known as the Modern Elder, chip started the Modern Elder Academy, now known as MEA, the world's first midlife wisdom school, with large sprawling, beautiful campuses in Baja and Santa Fe. He's also written seven books, given a TED Talk, and is just a genuinely interesting and amazing human and friend.\n\n(00:02:01):\nIn our conversation, we explore how to be successful in tech as you age, what he's learned working with and for Brian Chesky, including a lot of real talk, how to build a great culture at your company, his near-death experience, and how it changed the trajectory of his life, and so much more.

Chip, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nChip Conley (00:04:38):\nOh, my god, Lenny, I sort of feel like I'm your father who's so proud of his son. My son has done so well, and I like to talk about, tell all my friends about you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:49):\nWow, I am honored. I'm happy that I'm making you proud, Chip, and I feel the same in reverse. We got to work together for many years at Airbnb. I got to learn a ton from you. I'm really excited that more people are going to get to learn from you from this conversation. I'm thinking that the way that we break up this conversation is kind of break it up into three parts, which are kind of the three arcs of your career. The three parts are your early career, building Joie de Vivre, your time at Airbnb, where we got to work together, and then talking through what you're working on now, the Modern Elder Academy.\n\n(00:05:22):\nI actually want to start with the middle chapter. I'm going to talk about Airbnb where we got to work together. Let's paint a picture of just what it was like for you to join Airbnb in your fifties surrounded by a bunch of 20 something, 30 somethings reporting to Brian Chesky, who is, I don't know, in his thirties. What was that like?\n\nChip Conley (00:05:41):\nYeah, I wasn't planning on doing this. I got a call from a woman named Natalie Tucci who worked at Airbnb, and said, \"Brian Chesky and I've been talking about having you come in and give a talk. Are you open to that?\" I was like, \"Well, what is Airbnb?\" This was 13 years ago, I think it was the end of 2012. Then Brian called me and said, \"Listen, we really want you to come in.\" I came in and gave a talk about innovation and hospitality.\n\n(00:06:14):\nI think I didn't realize it was sort of a dress rehearsal for Brian to see whether the younger crowd there, I was 52, the average age was 26, would feel good about an old geezer like me with a bricks and mortar boutique hotel background, talking about the industry that Airbnb was disrupting. As it turns out, people liked me. Brian said, \"I want you to come in and work 15 hours a week as a consultant. I want you to be my in-house mentor for both me, and Joe and Nate.\" I said, \"Okay, 15 hours a week is great,\" and then within three weeks, it was 15 hours a day.\n\n(00:07:00):\nI was saying to Brian, \"You're actually not paying me anything.\" He gave me a little bit of stock that would vest in six months and I said, \"I don't know that this deal's working for me. It seems like the company needs to be a little more than you said.\" He said, \"Yeah, I got you. I just wanted you to get in here and see what you could do.\" Long story short is I ended up going full-time. It was hard at first, Lenny, because I didn't understand the tech lingo. I didn't have any background. I was 52. I'd never worked in a tech company before.\n\n(00:07:42):\nI was mentoring Brian on leadership, but he was also my boss. I was the head of global hospitality and strategy, which meant initially, I was in charge of all the hosts in the world. Over time, that meant a lot more things too. I was involved in many parts of the business, definitely not the technical parts, but I think the hardest thing for me was just that initially, when people were talking about product, and Jobot said, \"I'm the chief product officer,\" and I'm like, \"Well, isn't the product the homes and the apartments?\" Jobot said, \"No, product in the tech industry is something different.\"\n\n(00:08:23):\nI had to be both wise and curious, and often the dumbest person in the room. It required me to have a certain amount of humility as well as to be reporting to a guy 21 years younger than me, Brian.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:36):\nThat actually, the point you're making there about what is the product I asked Laura Hughes, formerly Laura Modi, what to talk to you about, who we got to work together. She's the CEO of Bobbie now. You worked closely with her at Airbnb. She said this was the thing that stuck with her most about working with you is coming in and everyone's talking about, \"We got to make the product better. We got to optimize this button and improve conversion, and product, product, product.\"\n\n(00:08:59):\nYou're just like, \"What is the product? I thought the product of Airbnb was the hosts, and the experiences, and the trips.\" I think that shows the value of someone like you coming in",

I thought the product of Airbnb was the hosts, and the experiences, and the trips.\" I think that shows the value of someone like you coming in with different experience, and also older, and helping us communicate differently to hosts who also don't understand.\n\nChip Conley (00:09:15):\nWell, there's an interesting thing also, Lenny, and you notice the difference in age between our hosts and our guests was probably about 10 years maybe. Over time, it actually got higher, because we started actually reaching out more aggressively to boomers and Gen Xers to be hosts. You had, I remember at one point, and again, let's get into a product talk here, I remember at one point, there was a conversation that was going on about taking Airbnb so it was mobile only.\n\n(00:09:47):\nPartly because back in the day, the two sharing economy darlings were Uber and Airbnb. Of course, Uber was pretty much a mobile only app. Airbnb started as non-mobile and then went mobile. Then it was like, \"Oh, wouldn't it be interesting if everything was mobile?\" At some point, I just said, \"Listen, let's get some older people who are hosts in here to see how well they will be versed in managing their listing purely on mobile.\"\n\n(00:10:18):\nThere were times where I was a voice for older users, in this case, hosts, that was helpful to guys and women in their twenties who were the engineers and designers and product managers. I always liked working with you. I want to just compliment Lenny for a minute.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:40):\nOh, how sweet is that?\n\nChip Conley (00:10:41):\nWe did a lot of different things together, and what I appreciated was you had a humility to you that was different than a lot of the other product managers. There's other product managers, I'm not going to mention their names, and some of these product managers were very good. There were other product managers though who I found it sometimes hard to work with, because they expected me to know as much as they did.\n\n(00:11:07):\nI guess it would be, if the opposite side of that would be an older manager expecting a younger manager to have as much emotional intelligence, because emotional intelligence on average is something we get better at as we get older. I think the key for me to work in that environment and make it work was to not pretend to know things I didn't know, it was to have a sense of humor and humility in how I operated, and it was to show respect and hope that I got it in return. I don't know if you felt that way, Lenny. That's the kind of environment I tried to embody there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:45):\nAbsolutely. There's a couple of threads there I want to follow. One is just working for Brian. A lot of people talk about founder mode, and the power of founder mode, it's so great. That's how we-\n\nChip Conley (00:11:55):\nGuess who-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):\nExactly.\n\nChip Conley (00:11:57):\n... populated that recently, that was Brian.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:01):\nExactly. It's great to be in founder mode. It's not as great to be working for someone in founder mode. Often a very challenging place to be.\n\nChip Conley (00:12:07):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:07):\nYou reported to Brian. Also, you were just your own boss basically your entire career. You never really had to report to someone before. Also, he was in his thirties, you're in your fifties. What was it like working for Brian? The more real you can be, the better, because a lot of people always talk about here, it's like, \"It was wonderful, I learned so much.\" Just like what was that experience? What did you learn from working for someone like Brian?\n\nChip Conley (00:12:30):\nWell, let's start with the fact that I would never have gone to work for Airbnb if I didn't believe in Brian, because quite frankly, when Brian approached me and we started talking about it, I was like, I wasn't sure I liked the business model all that well as a hotelier. I had to believe in something beyond the business model, because I wasn't sure that the business model would work. Although soon after joining, I saw the numbers. I was like, \"Wow, this is working pretty well.\"\n\n(00:12:56):\nI believed in Brian because the thing that Brian showed up with initially was just a curiosity and an appetite for learning. I remember back in 2011, when the big debacle happened with the apartment getting trashed by a guest. Brian decided he was going to go to find George Tenet, the former head of the CIA. Brian would go to experts and say to the expert, \"I don't know what the hell I'm doing.\" He did that with me when it came to hospitality. I appreciated that a guy who had a lot of hubris, and Brian definitely has a lot of hubris, could also have the humility to say, \"I want to learn more about this.\"\n\n(00:13:42):\nIt's sort of a growth mindset. What was hard with Brian is, I'd say",

What was hard with Brian is, I'd say, three things. Number one is Brian assumed everybody else was going to work at the same pace and duration, and he still has this issue. The beautiful thing about Brian is he's been very honest in the last couple of years on podcasts about his workaholism, and about the fact that the way he lives his life is not like other people. Back when I joined, his point of view is like, \"Hey, we're having a meeting in the office tonight at 10 o'clock, be there.\"\n\n(00:14:20):\nIt's like, \"Really? No, I don't think so.\" I think the fact that Brian assumed everybody else was as one-dimensional in their focus as him was at times a problem, especially for a guy like me who was, I was in a stage in my career where I have a lot of interests. That was one. Number two is Brian admires and admired back then, Steve Jobs so much that there was a sense that as a guy who came from the product world, from the Rhode Island School of Design, he knew better than anybody else.\n\n(00:15:05):\nThere was this, one of the challenges for a CEO sometimes, and this was my experience in my 24 years of running Joie de Vivre, my boutique hotel company, is it feels good when you feel needed. To come into a room and sort of see something, and then point out the things that are wrong makes you feel good. If you don't have emotional intelligence, that process can really piss people off or demotivate people. In Brian's case, I didn't have to deal with that too much, because he didn't understand, when I was starting, it was really, I was in charge of the hosts around the world.\n\n(00:15:45):\nQuite frankly, the idea of what's the psychology of the host? What's a host entrepreneur like? I went on a world tour to 20 different cities, and went and talked to hosts. I think I came back from that with a little bit of credibility with Brian to say like, \"Hey, yes, our data science team and the quality folks who are doing qualitative interviews, they're getting something out of this.\" I actually went into the homes of these hosts all around the world, and I think I was lucky because Brian did less of that than he did with other people.\n\n(00:16:19):\nFor the product team, my God, a product meeting with Brian would keep people up the night before, not just because they were actually working all night long to get prepared, but also they knew they would work all night long, because they probably wouldn't sleep in anticipation for this. That was another issue, I'd say. I'd say the other thing that, and in each of these cases, I think Brian's getting better. Just like Steve Jobs got better over time when he left and then he came back, he was much better when he came back, from all the people I've talked with who worked with him.\n\n(00:16:53):\nI'd say the third thing for Brian was the sense that adding a zero to something in terms of expectations, or thinking you're going to set a deadline that is unreasonable is necessary. If you don't do that, there's almost an underlying message that people won't kick ass on their own. There was a sense that Brian had that he had to maybe create ridiculous goals, because even if we hit half of that goal, it was very encouraging. What he missed in that was the fact that when you miss a goal, and when you have someone who has power over you setting the goal, or encouraging a particular goal, you're setting people up for a lot of stress.\n\n(00:17:51):\nAt the end of the day, I think Brian is a generational leader as a millennial, and I think he deserves a lot of credit. Airbnb is as successful as it is, partly because of Brian's leadership. I would not have been there without him. Having said that, I had to hold my tongue in meetings sometimes when I saw how he was operating, because I wouldn't have done it that way. I think over time, I hope I had a little bit of influence on him in terms of how to apply some emotional intelligence to leading people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:28):\nFor people in this position, a lot of people work for founders, especially now that founder mode is a thing. Every founder is just like, \"I'm the founder, you got to do what I tell you. It's founder mode. Again, this is how we win. We're in founder mode.\" You shared really good insight of building credibility as a really good lever to work better with someone like that. Is there anything else you just think as tactics to be effective with founders in founder mode?\n\nChip Conley (00:18:53):\nKnowing what I know now, I would say, \"Lenny, let's do a little pep talk, you and me before the meeting.\" I want you to start the meeting with the following as you present and Brian's in the room. \"Brian, let's talk about what we're trying to accomplish here. Let's get really clear,\" and you probably did this, but, \"let's get really clear on what both, what's the intention of this iteration that we're doing on the product? What defines success, and what do I want to get",

What defines success, and what do I want to get accomplished in this meeting?\"\n\n(00:19:25):\nYou start with that, because that actually helps to make sure there's alignment. Frankly, if there's not alignment, you might as well not have the meeting. Let's spend the rest of this meeting talking about alignment. That's what I would do, because that's something you can come back to over and over again during the rest of the meeting when Brian or the founder, whomever it is, is beating you up on something, saying like, \"Well, let me tell you why it looks like that or why we're doing that.\" It goes back to that, the three principles or the three key goals we're trying to do with this product update. Yeah, so try to set alignment on the front end.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:06):\nThat's an important tip for anyone working with anyone, even. I love just that that works especially well here. Then just going back to the credibility piece, what you shared there is you went on this world tour, not something everyone can do, but just getting really close to your customers, and using that as a, \"Hey, I actually know what I'm talking about. You actually should listen to me even though you're the founder.\"\n\nChip Conley (00:20:27):\nYeah, I think the other thing is PowerPoint or whatever tool you're using, just be careful about being overly reliant upon it, especially when you have a combustible founder who may take you off path, such that your deck in its current order makes no sense at all. I always wanted to really limit the deck as much as possible, because I didn't know where the meeting was going to go. I wanted the decks helpful at the start, at the very start, to just set principles, set goals. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:09):\nThis whole story of you joining Airbnb in your fifties is a really good example of intergenerational collaboration, something that you're big on, just the value of having folks that are older working at tech companies. Maybe just talk about that broadly, and then we segue into other elements of your career.\n\nChip Conley (00:21:28):\nI wrote a book called Wisdom at Work: the Making of a Modern Elder after my Airbnb experience. I did a lot of research. I was like, \"Wow, so why do we have less intergenerational collaboration in the workplace, especially in Silicon Valley than we could use?\" I started interviewing people, then I started talking to brain scientists, neuroscientists, and realized that a younger brain has fluid intelligence, tends to be fast and focused, really good at problem solving, very good at linearity in terms of looking at things.\n\n(00:21:59):\nAs you get older, the brain shrinks a little bit and you have crystallized intelligence. In crystallized intelligence, what's going on is you're going from left brain to right brain more adeptly. There's a little bit less focus, a little more holistic thinking, systemic thinking, connecting the dots. You can imagine that on a team when you have older brains connecting the dots, thinking broadly, peripherally, younger team members being really fast and focused, and being able to think linearly how to get things done, that combination can either be successful or not.\n\n(00:22:36):\nWhen it's successful. It's brilliant. I think Laura, Laura Modi, Laura Hughes Modi, who was my director of hospitality, but also we worked in so many different capacities with her in the company, I loved working with her because her brain worked different than my brain. That's the opportunity is when you realize that diversity on a team, there's lots of kinds of diversity, but when it comes to brain diversity, not just with neuro diverse people but age diverse people, you get a benefit, an effective benefit that is not as noticeable, quite frankly, in some other diversities.\n\n(00:23:16):\nI found that over and over was really helpful. Part of my job sometimes was to find the blind spot. Again, if you are very focused, one of the things I said to Brian early on was, \"I've seen the business plan. Now, I know the goals of how big we want to be in three years.\" This was very early in my tenure. I said, \"But what we really have done, everything we're trying to do is to have no regulations and pay no occupancy tax.\" Now, hotels pay a bed tax, occupancy tax, we're not paying it, and we're trying to do everything we can not to pay it.\n\n(00:23:51):\nKnowing that, so for our listeners and viewers to know this, this is something that a guest pays. It's not the host who pays it, the guest pays it. It's part of the bill. If you go and stay in a hotel, there's a big, big tax part of the bill, but it made us more affordable by not having to have our guests pay taxes. Long story short is I said to Brian, \"If we're as big as we're going to be three years from now, I promise you we're going to be regulated. I promise you we're going to be paying occupancy taxes. Let's take some proactive steps toward building a strategy for how we're going to be regulated.\"\n\n(00:24:28):\nThat has consistently been Airbnb's biggest challenge",

    "content": ", big tax part of the bill, but it made us more affordable by not having to have our guests pay taxes. Long story short is I said to Brian, \"If we're as big as we're going to be three years from now, I promise you we're going to be regulated. I promise you we're going to be paying occupancy taxes. Let's take some proactive steps toward building a strategy for how we're going to be regulated.\"\n\n(00:24:28):\nThat has consistently been Airbnb's biggest challenge is regulation in municipal markets all around the world. If we'd started a little earlier, maybe in New York, maybe in New York, it wouldn't have gotten to the point where it has been toxic in New York for the last dozen years ever since I was there. There's a few other markets in the world where it was like that. I would just say the value in having some age diversity, even when you have an older person reporting to a younger person, is it can be collaborative.\n\n(00:25:02):\nThere was a guy named John Q. Smith, an engineer who I think you probably remember him at Airbnb. This is a guy who looked younger than he was, and he was a little bit nervous about telling people his age. The thing that was great about John is over time, he was not necessarily going to be the best coder at Airbnb. There was a whole new collection of coders coming in every month, but he became a great manager.\n\n(00:25:32):\nThe beautiful thing about moving from the individual contributor to the manager, the person who can actually bring out the best in a bunch of younger people, who may be better technically than he or she is, but they know how to elevate talent. I call this invisible productivity. It's productivity in which you make everybody else around you better. That's something I tried to do with my teams at Airbnb. Ultimately, I had six different teams, five hospitality and five other teams reporting to me. I did my best to just be the kind of person who wasn't solving all the problems, but I was trying to elevate.\n\n(00:26:11):\nThere's a woman named Lisa Dubost who is at Airbnb, and she, one day, the HR department was reporting to me at one point, and she was running HR. She was 25 and had no background in HR at all. One day she came in to me and she just said, \"Chip, you are my confidant.\" Lisa has a French accent and fluent in French. She said confidant in just the right way. I said, \"Oh, well thank you, Lisa.\" I said to her, \"You haven't given me any juicy details yet. A confidant is someone who has the secrets.\"\n\n(00:26:42):\nShe said to me, \"No, in my part of France, a confidant is somebody who gives you confidence.\" It was like, \"Oh, well, maybe that's what a mentor can be is a confidant, someone who gives you confidence and helps by asking questions, helps you as the younger mentee find your roadmap to success.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:05):\nYou're sharing a lot of really good examples of the value of older folks being within tech companies. Let me just ask you this, how real is ageism in tech? I ask because a lot of people that are hiring are probably thinking, no, no, I'm not biased. I'm going to hire the best person. If they're someone in their fifties, I'll hire them. No problem. It doesn't feel like it actually works out that way often. Just how real of a problem is this? What do you see?\n\nChip Conley (00:27:27):\nYeah, it's clearly a problem. I'd say it's maybe a little bit less of a problem than it was a dozen years ago, because I think a dozen years ago, it was almost a blind spot. In Airbnb, we had a group called Wisdom at Airbnb. It was an employee resource group for people 40 and older. There are lots of these kinds of groups that didn't exist a dozen years ago in all kinds of tech companies, which is good, because it means that there's a voice and a way to congregate with a bunch of people who are older.\n\n(00:28:00):\nUltimately, we had these senior nomads come in and be like the voice of the customer for 10 weeks at Airbnb. It was the Wisdom at Airbnb older employee group that really actually pushed for this with Brian. The challenge is, in a world in which the smartest new people, especially when it comes to technical skills and engineering, are coming in with a whole new set of skills that an older person doesn't have, the older person is both expensive and may be perceived as slow. In the era of AI, it's a whole new ballgame.\n\n(00:28:42):\nThe question, I think, will be if what AI cannot do is the human wisdom piece, artificial intelligence and human wisdom might be the balance beams here. Is it possible that older managers who have a little more emotional intelligence, a little more pattern recognition, a little bit more wisdom, can be a value to a company? The jury's still out. There's a New York Times article that just came out about the question of is AI going to wipe out older people's jobs or younger people's jobs? I think the answer is both, but the question is how bad is it for both of them?\n\n(00:29:29):\nI think what I would say to an older person, and when I say older, I mean like 45 or older, if you've done well financially and you're doing okay, the question you might ask yourself is, are you open, as I ultimately was with Brian in my fourth year at Airbnb? I took a substantial pay cut. I think it went down to",

I took a substantial pay cut. I think it went down to 40% or 50% time, and my stock, my options were dropped to that level, my salaries dropped to that level, because I didn't want to work full time anymore. There are a lot of people who can be valuable in a company who have some institutional wisdom, some process knowledge of how to get things done in this organization.\n\n(00:30:08):\nIn tech companies, that's really important. Airbnb, one of the biggest challenges that Airbnb has always been, how do I get shit done around here? Process knowledge allows you to understand, how do you deal with an org chart and get things done partly because you understand the motivations of different groups? That is something you build over time. Long story short is I just think that older people might look at their workload and say, \"I'm willing to take a 20% or a 40% pay cut to go to 80% or 60% time,\" and the company is going to get their money's worth in that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:49):\nThat's a really interesting point, that if you're older and you're maybe less connected to the most cutting edge ways of building and coding, AI makes that a lot easier in many ways where you start to just talk to it. You don't even need to understand what's happening underneath.\n\nChip Conley (00:31:03):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:05):\nThere's a lot of listeners who are older in tech, there's a lot of listeners who are approaching midlife, let's say, worried about what happens to their career. When you look at people you've worked with and had at your academy, which we'll talk about, who continue to thrive and continue to have a really healthy career in tech, what do they do differently? What do they have in common that other folks you think should work on and focus on?\n\nChip Conley (00:31:28):\nI think this idea being a mentor and a mentor and an intern, there's just the voracious appetite for curiosity. When I talk to someone who's a midlife and wants to be in the tech world or already is, the thing I say is, \"Show up with curiosity and a passionate engagement for what you do, and people won't necessarily notice your wrinkles as much as they'll notice your energy.\" Energy has two parts to it. Energy is, they notice that you are not just sort of resting on your laurels, you have physical energy in how you do your job.\n\n(00:32:04):\nWhen people are like that, they're sort of timeless. They're age fluid, as I say. We talk about gender fluidity. Well, there could be age fluidity. They're not defined by their age. The other part of energy that's important is being positive. That's sort of more energetic, a little bit more California energetic. There's a sense of when someone's got good energy, you're drawn to them. It's about showing up with the kind of energy of someone 10 or 20 years younger than you, and then showing up with positive energy.\n\n(00:32:38):\nI think one of the things that would say I did well at, there's lots of things I didn't do well at Airbnb, but in terms of what I did well is I was very approachable. Over the course of time, the number of mentees I had, the number of people who just wanted to have coffee with me or tea, the number of people who just said, \"Thank you for being in that meeting, you just sort of gave it a positive feeling,\" was really important.\n\n(00:33:04):\nMy energy, both the positive energy part, and then also the fact that yeah, I could work 60 and 70 hours a week, and I could travel around the world as the Secretary of State of the company, which is what Brian called me a couple times on stage. The fact that I could do that meant that no one was looking at me and saying, \"Let's get rid of the old fogey.\" Well, maybe some people the board, but I wasn't aware of them. I just think show up with that passionate engagement, that curiosity, that energy, the ability to be both the learner and the teacher, with respect for people that are younger than you, and you're going to probably do pretty well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:44):\nThat is really great advice. Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast. It's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows. Here's how Coda can help you. Imagine starting a project at work, and your vision is clear, you know exactly who's doing what and where to find the data that you need to do your part.\n\n(00:34:11):\nIn fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs, to documents and spreadsheets, lives in one tab all in Coda. With Coda's collaborative all in one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI, all in one easy to organize tab.

Coda.io/Lenny.\n\n(00:35:03):\nInterestingly, curiosity comes up a lot when I ask AI-forward people, what are they focusing on helping their kids learn most? Curiosity is the most common way to describe. At every stage of life, curiosity is something to cultivate. I want to go to the flip side of companies looking to hire. It feels like there's this untapped supply of awesome people that companies with ageism and tech aren't finding and hiring. To help hiring managers and companies take advantage of this, what's something you suggest they do? How do they shift their mindset or maybe shift the way they hire that might help them find these people?\n\nChip Conley (00:35:39):\nI think we're moving into, there's a book that David Epstein wrote called Range, and the whole premise of range is that we are moving out of the era of the specialists and into the era of the generalists. I think AI is just accelerating this. As we are more reliant upon AI, and AI can be exceptional at technical skills and solutions really expeditiously, I think generalists, people who can think broadly, become all the more important. I think that what I would say to someone in HR or recruiting is beyond what I already said before, is the person passionate?\n\n(00:36:23):\nAre they curious? Are they a learner? Do they have good energy? I would also say, are they a generalist when they're a problem solver? I actually think that's going to be an increasingly important part of how effective companies think broadly. I think that's a key one. I think also, this idea of how do you create intergenerational collaboration in the form of mutual mentorships? One of the things I loved at Airbnb, there were a few people I did this with, where I had something to teach them and they had something to teach me.\n\n(00:37:02):\nA good example, my iPhone, so there's 97% of the utility of my iPhone that I probably don't use and don't know how to use. This was back in, let's say, 2013, 2014. There were people who knew iPhone or Google Suites back then. I'd never used a Google Doc back then when I joined Airbnb. There were people who could teach me something technical, and then they wanted to learn something from me, which would be like, \"How do you want a great meeting,\" or, \"How do you give a great employee review?\" There are a lot of managers who've never been a manager before.\n\n(00:37:45):\nHow do you disperse people like me in the organization so that there's usually not enough time for these young managers to come to some training session on how to do a good employee review. You sort of have to do it out there in the field. It's like apprenticeship back in the trades. You're an electrician apprentice, not because you're watching some video on it, you're out there in the field, doing it. That's a huge value in a younger company when you have some older people who have not been vested with the responsibility of managing those younger people.\n\n(00:38:23):\nThey may actually be reporting to someone younger than them, but they're there to actually be support. In some ways, I think that was part of the unexpected value that I was able to offer to Airbnb and to Brian specifically, because there are a ton of people in Airbnb who were not even in my departments who would come to me and say, \"I'm having a problem. How do I solve this? Can we spend lunch together?\" I almost always said yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):\nI think the reason people did that in many ways is you just have a very unique aura of wisdom, and it's hard to replicate that, Chip.\n\nChip Conley (00:39:04):\nYes, and it all comes back to the curiosity. If I was just the older elder, dispensing wisdom, people would've gotten bored very quickly. I think the fact, yeah, I was on the board of Burning Man, that's cool. I show up as someone who feels younger than I am. I'm turning 65 this year. The bottom line is I think people lost track of my age, partly because I lost track of my age.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:38):\nThat's such good advice on the front end to be successful as a person kind of getting older in tech is curiosity, positive energy, the way you talked about it, passionate, engagement, is that the term?\n\nChip Conley (00:39:52):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:53):\nThen on the other side is hire generalists. This actually comes up a lot in the AI conversations, just exactly as you said,",

This actually comes up a lot in the AI conversations, just exactly as you said, the power of generalists reminds me, I'm going to this gym now, and the lady there is just like, \"I love AI so much, because I'm just such a big picture person, and I am so bad at just getting, thinking about the details, and AI solves all that for me.\" It's like, \"Here, here's what I want to do. I'll do this, move my house to here, here.\" It's like, \"Here's what you need to do, step one, two, three, four, five.\"\n\nChip Conley (00:40:18):\nIt is remarkable. Since the time I've known you, how fast it has become dominant in our lives. Yeah, I think one of the last thing I'd say is, look, I'm privileged. For those of you who are listening or watching this and you're saying, \"Well, Chip, you were 52 years old and they came to you. That doesn't happen to me. I'm not in that position.\" The thing I would say is, you're right, but I could have been plucked and brought in and partly as Brian's boy, people would've rejected me, because if I didn't show up the right way, it wouldn't have worked well.\n\n(00:41:00):\nThere are lots of people who Brian brought into the company who didn't work well. I think the key is how do you get the foot in the door? At the end of the day, those second and third order of degrees of separation in terms of networking are still essential. The most important thing is to be able to articulate what you have accomplished in a new way that a recruiter says, \"Wow.\" I really tell people I would love to see a resume.\n\n(00:41:41):\nFirst of all, the question that I think it was, who was it? Someone asked it, I don't remember if it was Cheryl Stamberg or someone else asked her, who said, \"What's the biggest problem you're dealing with here, and how can I help you?\" That's a great line. Number two is what I love to see is not so much what roles you've had, what bullet points do you have of your things you've learned? Give me, in a paragraph, a thorny problem you faced. What was the problem, and what skills you used to actually accomplish it, and what was the result of that?\n\n(00:42:22):\nI would love to see a resume like that. The older you are, the more you can actually have a resume like that. Then you can use that as the conversation piece when you're doing interviews.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:34):\nI love that. I love that we're getting into interview advice and resume advice.\n\nChip Conley (00:42:37):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:38):\nSpeaking of thorny problems, and also why Brian decided to reach out to you, I want to go back to the beginning of your career.\n\nChip Conley (00:42:45):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:46):\nRight out of business-\n\nChip Conley (00:42:47):\nYou're good at this, by the way. You're good at this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:49):\nI was thinking ahead. Okay, so you're in business school, you left business school, you're like, \"Maybe I should start a hotel.\" Something that rarely works out usually probably leads to a lot of money lost and a lot of frustration and just like, \"Okay, what have I done with my life?\" Worked out for you.\n\n(00:43:07):\nEnded up building the second largest boutique hotel chain in the world, Joie de Vivre, beloved. I loved every single experience I've had as Joie de Vivre. When you sold it, I was like, \"That is so sad.\" Talk about just that story. I know this could go on for hours, but what's the-\n\nChip Conley (00:43:21):\nYeah, I'll be brief.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:22):\nYeah.\n\nChip Conley (00:43:23):\n26 years old, couple of years out of Stanford Business School, working for a commercial real estate developer. I was bored silly. I wanted to do something more creative. Bill Graham, famous concert promoter, said to me, because I had gotten to know him, \"What San Francisco really needs is a rock and roll hotel.\" I decided to start looking to find a broken down motel hotel that I could turn into a rock and roll hotel.\n\n(00:43:46):\nI found something in the Tenderloin, and turned it into the Phoenix, which became a famous rock and roll hotel that I have owned for 39 years now. Long story short is that was how I started Joie de Vivre, the company. We grew to 52 hotels around California, became the second largest, as you said, in the world in terms of the number of hotels, boutique hotels that we operated. I loved it till I hated it. In my late forties, I hated it, didn't want to do it anymore. The great recession came along and it was just kicking my ass.\n\n(00:44:23):\nI really went through a bit of what I now",

In my late forties, I hated it, didn't want to do it anymore. The great recession came along and it was just kicking my ass.\n\n(00:44:23):\nI really went through a bit of what I now call a midlife chrysalis, but a midlife crisis, where I just wanted to change everything. I got through it. I had an NDE, I had a near-death experience where I had an allergic reaction to an antibiotic and I died. From that point forward, I realized every day is a gift and a bonus, and I decided to sell my company at the bottom of the great recession. That's really how I created this space in my life to be able to join Airbnb.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:58):\nWell, let's back up a little bit. This near-death experience, share more there. What happened there?\n\nChip Conley (00:45:04):\nYeah, so I write books. I've written seven or eight books, and I had written a book called Peak: How Great Companies Get Their Mojo from Maslow. It was a book that Brian really liked, and part of the reason he wanted to reach out to me. I was on a book tour, I had a broken ankle. I broke my ankle at a bachelor party playing baseball. I ended up with a cut on my leg and the cut on my leg had fertilizer in it and went septic. I was on a very strong antibiotic and I died.\n\n(00:45:39):\nI went flatlined from the allergic reaction to the antibiotic. I saw, it happened nine times over 90 minutes, I kept dying, kept flatlining, yeah. Ended up in the hospital for three days. They finally said, \"Listen, it's an allergic reaction, we believe.\" They thought it was a heart attack, a bunch of stuff, stroke, et cetera. No, it was the allergic reaction. I saw birds. I saw all this beautiful stuff. We don't have time to go into it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:10):\nYou did? What?\n\nChip Conley (00:46:11):\nI did. You want to hear this? Yeah, I saw this beautiful stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:13):\nLet's do it.\n\nChip Conley (00:46:15):\nI think there's a hotel in San Francisco called the Vitale that I built across the street from the ferry building, and it's still there, but it's no longer called the Vitale. In that hotel, there were these slippers in every guest room. One slipper said slow, the other slipper said down. I was wearing these slippers in my flatline thing, flying in the air in a 40-foot tall living room in the Alps, surrounded by birds that were tweeting and chirping at me.\n\n(00:46:50):\nI understood bird talk. I understand exactly what they were saying. They kept telling me, \"If you slow down, you will see beauty and you will see awe.\" There was a bunch of other things, but let me just limit it to that and just say, and then the birds would say, \"It's time to go.\" The birds would go out the big window into the mountains, and I would try to follow them. Right as I would get to the window, all of a sudden, I'd come back to life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:20):\nHoly shit. I love that there was a message inside of this experience. I don't know how many people experienced that. Clearly, this led to a big life change. It's interesting that a lot of times, you need something like that. You've been doing this for how many years at that point? Running Joie de Vivre?\n\nChip Conley (00:47:38):\nAt that point, I'd been running Joie de Vivre for 22 years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:39):\n22 years. It's interesting that you need something like that a lot of times. Otherwise, it just momentum just keeps carrying you forward.\n\nChip Conley (00:47:46):\nWithin two years, I'd sold it, and I had the chance to move on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:52):\nWith building Joie de Vivre, something you've written about a number of times is just the way you built it is a really unique approach to building a business. Specifically, there's a huge focus on culture, which also came out at Airbnb. Talk about just why you see culture as such an important part of how you build a business like tangibly. A lot of people talk about culture, warm, fuzzy stuff, but you think about it very tangibly.\n\nChip Conley (00:48:15):\nCulture is what happens around here when the boss is not around. The more distributed a company, the more culture is important. The boss is around in a traditional bricks and mortar workplace where everybody shows up at eight and leaves at six, and we all see each other. In my company, in Joie de Vivre, we had 52 hotels, and 25 restaurants, and four spas, and it was distributed. I couldn't be in all those places all the time.\n\n(00:48:52):\nSimilarly, with Airbnb, Airbnb had offices around the world and it was a global company. The more distributed you are, of course, in the remote work world we live in, the more culture is important, and more difficult. When you're remote",

The more distributed you are, of course, in the remote work world we live in, the more culture is important, and more difficult. When you're remote, there's these few cues you have about how we do things around here. They're usually in a digital, virtual format, which is why it's all the more important for you to have in-person gatherings of a team more often if you are virtual.\n\n(00:49:27):\nAt the end of the day, the reason the culture is important is because it actually helps, it helps guide people in terms of making decisions, but it's also a magnet for the right kind of people. Oracle has a different culture than Apple, which has a different culture than Facebook. You can choose the place you're going to work based upon the culture. There are people who can be very good at what they do, but if they're in the wrong culture, they're in the wrong kind of environment, and they're not willing to shift to fit that culture.\n\n(00:50:01):\nWe saw it at Airbnb all over and over again. In fact, Airbnb saw it, I think when with Amazon people. Apple people have resonated pretty well at Airbnb, Amazon people, less so. Those are two different cultures, Amazon and Apple. Therefore, understanding a culture before you even actually take the job is one of the more important decisions you need to make is like, \"Is this culture a culture that I can live with and maybe influence?\" There's language about culture fit.\n\n(00:50:37):\nI like to say culture add, because culture fit to me can actually be quite negative toward somebody who is the aberration. You have to fit in. Especially if this is a demographic thing, a person of color, a gay person, a person in a wheelchair, so you have to fit in. A culture add suggests that actually having some diversity on the team is helpful, because it actually adds to the culture. You still have to be able to get along in that culture. Culture is an intangible. That's the problem with it is it's hard to measure, but you see its value and you understand whether it's working based upon employee pulse reports and things like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:24):\nYou talk about having to understand the culture is such a key part of having success at a company. Do you have any advice for just how to understand the culture for someone interviewing? I don't know. You came in, you work part-time, it's easier to experience it all. Any tips there for, \"Okay, this is for me, it's not for me?\"\n\nChip Conley (00:51:39):\nWhen you're interviewing, you're also interviewing them. When you're interviewing, it's not about you having to prove yourself. It's also for them to actually prove themselves as a company, and also try to understand if there is some alignment in the company. The kind of questions I would ask as someone who's being interviewed would be, what are three to five adjectives that define this culture? What's the biggest problem in this culture, in terms of something that's just endemic or baked in across the organization?\n\n(00:52:14):\nIs it ever going to get fixed? How could I come in and maybe help that? Which frankly, at a very junior level, you're not going to be able to help it except for in very minor ways. If you're a senior person, you might be able to help it. Those are the kind of questions I'd want to know. Frankly, if I'm asking that same question about what are the adjectives to multiple people, am I hearing the same thing over and over again? If I'm not, is that because there's not alignment? Is that because different departments have different flavors?\n\n(00:52:48):\nYou could have a culture within a department that's very different than the overall corporate culture. The corporate culture certainly has an enormous oppressive influence, but you can be in a culture, a really great culture of a team or a department, in an overall company culture that's not good. In the long run, that oppressive company culture is either going to have to evolv,e or your department, you may lose people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:23):\nWhen I reflect back on the impact you had at Airbnb, one of the funny things I think about is triangles showing up a lot on decks, and specifically rooted in Maslow's hierarchy, just like everything's this Maslow hierarchy metaphor.\n\nChip Conley (00:53:41):\nTrue.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:43):\nThis one, I don't know, specific piece of this is you have this kind of model you think about for how to help employees be successful at a company. It's kind of rooted in your Peak book philosophy. Maybe just talk about that, and then if there's anything else you want to expand on with this power of thinking through the Maslow hierarchy.\n\nChip Conley (00:54:01):\nMaslow's hierarchy, basically five levels. Later in life, he had a seven and an eight level model, but at the base is the kind of physical, water, food, air, and you move up to self-actualization at the top. To use this model as a hierarchy of needs for employees, customers, and investors is what the Peak model is about. The Peak, my book. The employee model is really simple. It's money or compensation at the base, recognition in the middle, and meaning at the top.\n\n(00:54:39):",

It's money or compensation at the base, recognition in the middle, and meaning at the top.\n\n(00:54:39):\nNow, there are some industries and some kinds of jobs in which money is 90% of the pyramid. Just because of the base doesn't mean it's not the dominant part of the pyramid, but the differentiation often is in recognition and meaning. In nonprofits, usually the money piece of it's rather thin. The recognition's this, and meaning's huge. Understanding how do you create an organization, and I gave a TED Talk in 2010 about this topic as well, how do you measure the intangibles of meaning and how do you create an environment where people feel a sense of meaning?\n\n(00:55:18):\nThe customer pyramid, briefly, I'll just say that one, is meeting expectations is the base, meeting desires is in the middle, and then meeting unrecognized needs. I think one of the things that we did at Airbnb about a year after I joined, and when Jonathan Goldenhall was joining, is we really tried to ask ourselves, \"Are we in the home sharing business, or are we in some kind of business that is even bigger and broader than that?\" Ultimately, we came up with the idea that we were in the belong anywhere business.\n\n(00:55:49):\nAirbnb was not in home sharing, we were in belonging anywhere. Once you have that down, that was sort of the unrecognized need at the top of the pyramid. Then that becomes an organizing principle for how do you teach your hosts to create a sense of belonging? How does our marketing and advertising play up the belonging piece, especially and the everywhere piece, because hotels are not everywhere, but homes are? I would just say that this model, the idea of hierarchies is, I think, very helpful. Yeah, my book Peak has been around for 18 years, but I still am asked to give 20 or 30 speeches a year on it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:30):\nOh, man. This pyramid of comp, recognition, meaning is really interesting, especially these days, because with all this AI researcher poaching, there's all this talk of just like, \"Will people just go work wherever they get the most money, or is there a mission and meaning to the work they're doing that will keep them not taking a hundred million dollars offer?\" Seems to be happening in a lot of cases, which shows you the power of meaning.\n\nChip Conley (00:56:55):\nYeah. If you know you're working for a toxic company, at some point, your conscience kicks in. Whether it's toxic in terms of the purpose of the company, toxic in terms of the leadership or the culture, life is too short.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:10):\nOkay. You've had two major shifts in your career. You started the hotel chain, then you went to Airbnb. Most recently, the Airbnb experience, I imagine, led you to starting something called the Modern Elder Academy. Talk about what is the Modern Elder Academy?\n\nChip Conley (00:57:28):\nYeah, what is going on with that Modern Elder Academy? The Modern Elder Academy. There was a couple times where I was called the Modern Elder at Airbnb, and then I was told that a Modern Elder is someone who's as curious as they are wise. Jonathan Mildenhall, who is the chief marketing officer at Airbnb, used to call me the Modern Elder as well, and he said, \"If you ever create a school, Modern Elder would be a good name.\"\n\n(00:57:56):\nWe talked about it, and next thing I knew, I was saying, \"Okay, this is called the Modern Elder Academy.\" We now call it MEA because elder is a fraught word on some level, it makes you sound elderly. What I really wanted to create was a place where people could come and do a workshop, they're five day workshops in Baja on the beach, or in Santa Fe on a big four square mile horse ranch, and reimagine and repurpose yourself, and navigate transitions.\n\n(00:58:27):\nWe go through so many transitions in the middle of our life, let's say between, I define midlife as 35 to 75, guys. It's a very long life stage. We go through a lot of transitions. We are constantly evolving our purpose. We're building our wisdom. We have knowledge management tools out there, but we're the wisdom management tools. We're the tools that help us to get wiser over time, and then we need to reframe our relationship with getting older. Becca Levy has shown at Yale that when you shift your mindset on aging from a negative to a positive, you get seven and a half years of additional life, which is more life than any other biohack that's being done right now.\n\n(00:59:08):\nThat's what we do, and we have 7,000 grads from 60 countries, and 56 regional chapters around the world. It's a bit of a movement, and I teach. I teach some of the workshops, and we have all kinds of famous people who come and teach. For me, creating the world's first midlife wisdom school just feels like the natural next thing for me to do. I love hospitality, so it's a very upscale kind of experience, but we have scholarships.

I love wellness.\n\n(00:59:45):\nI've owned the Kabuki Springs and Spa for 28 years, which is the largest spa in San Francisco, and I love education. My book, Wisdom at Work: The Making of a Modern Elder, gave me a curriculum in which we've expanded quite a bit with Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and UC, Berkeley professors helping us create a curriculum around midlife. That's how MEA came about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:14):\nTo your point, I forget who said, I think you said Jonathan has said this was a natural next step for you, I completely agree. It's like, looking back, this is the obvious thing you should be doing right now.\n\nChip Conley (01:00:22):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:23):\nAlso, I'm learning more things about you. I didn't know you were involved with the Kabuki Spa. I think Esalen and I knew, you just keep getting more interested.\n\nChip Conley (01:00:31):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:32):\nThere's a couple threads here I want to actually follow. This point you made about shifting your mindset to aging as a positive thing helps you live longer. That's such a powerful point. Can you just speak more to that, just what does that look like?\n\nChip Conley (01:00:43):\nYeah, there's lots of data points. I'll talk about two. One is this Becca Levy study, which has been going on for 15 to 20 years. If you sort of buy into the ageism of American society or Hallmark cards, when you get a card at age 40, 50, or beyond, there's a belief that life gets worse as you get older. If you can survive your midlife crisis, all you have to look forward to is disease, decrepitude, and death. The bottom line is there's a lot of things that get better with age. I wrote a book called Learning to Love Midlife.\n\n(01:01:20):\nThe subtitle says it all: 12 Reasons Why Life Gets Better with Age. What I really wanted to do with that book, which is really, it summarizes the MEA curriculum, I wanted to write a book that sort of helped people to see the upside of aging, the unexpected pleasures of aging. They had a pro-aging, not just an anti-aging point of view. When you actually have a pro-aging point of view and you see the upside of aging, you take better care of yourself, both your mind and your body. You actually are willing to learn and try new things.\n\n(01:01:51):\nOne of my favorite MEA questions is, 10 years from now, what will you regret if you don't learn it or do it now? It's a powerful question, really important question as we get older. When you're young, you've got all of your life left ahead of you. When I moved to Baja part-time in Mexico at age 56, I had a mindset which was, \"I'm too old to learn Spanish. I'm too old to learn to surf,\" but when I said, \"10 years from now, what will I regret if I don't learn it or it now?\" I said, \"Well, 10 years from now, I might still be living in Baja. I should learn Spanish, I should learn how to surf because we're right next to a surf break.\"\n\n(01:02:29):\nI did. What I believe is that anticipated regret is a form of wisdom, and it's a catalyst for taking action. That's one data point. The other data point is something called the U-curve of happiness, and it's been around for 20 years, and it shows the following. It has changed in the last couple of years because young adults are unhappy like never before. A 20 or a 22-year-old, really unhappy, 24-year-old, really unhappy.\n\n(01:02:58):\nHistorically, the way it was is you were happy from 18 to 23 or 24, and then around 23 or 24, you start to see a long, slow decline in life satisfaction that actually bottoms out between 45 and 50. I'm sorry to tell you that, Lenny, since you're 44, but your mileage may vary.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:17):\nYou're saying I'm the least happy I'll ever be. That's only upside. That's great. Yeah.\n\nChip Conley (01:03:21):\nWell, here's the part that's weird is that before this research was done, and it's global research across all demographics, what they found was starting around age 50 or 52, you get happier, so that you're happier in your fifties than your forties, sixties, fifties, seventies, happier than sixties, and the women in their eighties, happier than seventies. Wow. It's partly because we are in around 45 to 50, doing this thing called the midlife unraveling, what Brené Brown calls the midlife unraveling.\n\n(01:03:55):\nYou're unraveling your expectations, what you define as success, your definition of what a beautiful body looks like, and",

I can say that, yeah, I'm happier today at 64 than I was at 47 when I was going through my flatline experience, and not wanting to run my company anymore.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:19):\nYou used this term earlier, the midlife chrysalis, was that what it was?\n\nChip Conley (01:04:22):\nChrysalis. Chrysalis, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:23):\nChrysalis. What is that? Is that kind of along the same lines?\n\nChip Conley (01:04:27):\nIf you think about the caterpillar to butterfly journey, midlife is the chrysalis. It's that cocoon in which all of the change is happening. At the time, when you're going through it, it's like, \"Oh, shit. My life is liquefying in front of myself.\" On the other side of it, there's a metamorphosis that happens.\n\n(01:04:48):\nI like to use the language, in fact, I have a podcast called The Midlife Chrysalis, because I want to help change the dialogue around midlife, so that the number one word attached to midlife is not crisis, but in fact, it's maybe chrysalis, and the idea that life is meant to be transformative during that era.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:09):\nThat is actually very empowering. I am sort of going through that, not necessarily in this intense way yet, but that might be coming. You said there's a bunch of upsides to getting older. It might be helpful just to share a couple of those things for folks that are like, \"Oh, wow, I didn't realize that.\"\n\nChip Conley (01:05:23):\nEmotional intelligence grows with age. Our wisdom can grow with age, although we know 70-year-olds who are not as wise as 30-year-olds, so it's a matter of what you do with your life experience. I define wisdom as metabolized experience, mindfully shared for the common good. What else gets better with age? You learn how to edit. You have no more Fs left to give, no more fucks left to give. That is absolutely true, especially for women as they age. You are more spiritually curious. The list is long, and so there are a lot of things that, actually, another one that I love is you're not compartmentalized.\n\n(01:06:01):\nWhen you're younger, you're compartmentalized. As you grow older, you are growing whole, and that means you're alchemizing curiosity and wisdom, introvert, extrovert, masculine, feminine, gravitas, depth, and levity, lightness. The people who I really admire who are 85 years old, they're so present and they're so whole. They are just who they are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:25):\nThere's a quote I found from you along these lines, the societal narrative on aging is just don't do it.\n\nChip Conley (01:06:31):\nFantastic. Yeah. We sort of say we don't want to age, but we do want to live. Quite frankly, aging and living are the same thing, as are aging and growing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:44):\nComing back to MEA, just for folks that are interested, curious about this, who's this for, would you say? Who should seriously look into this program?\n\nChip Conley (01:06:52):\nMEA is really, the people who tend to come to MEA are in the midst of a transition. It could be selling their company, leaving a job, getting divorced, having kids, becoming an empty nester, taking care of parents till they're passing away, having a health diagnosis that's scary. Average age is 54, and it's people of all walks of life. It's not just the tech industry, but it's very popular in the tech industry. It's people who are looking to maybe do a reframe of their purpose, and maybe even a reinvention of their career.\n\n(01:07:29):\nYeah, the two campuses are just gorgeous. It's been called the Four Seasons meets Blue Zones meets the Esalen Institute, which I like. We have online programs too, and so you don't have to come to either of our campuses in Mexico, or on the beach, or in New Mexico. You can actually do it online.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:54):\nThose three, yeah, that's the tagline. That's your tagline right there. Esalen meets Blue Zones, meets what was the first one?\n\nChip Conley (01:08:00):\nThe Four Seasons.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:01):\nThe Four Seasons.\n\nChip Conley (01:08:02):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:03):\nNailed it.

It's called Wisdom Well, and it's on the MEA website. When I'm looking for inspiration, AI does it for me, and ultimately, it gives me a first draft. That's good enough for me then to say, \"Okay.\" There's times when I'm missing the inspiration. I tend to write really well in the morning.\n\n(01:08:47):\nIf it's any other time of the day, I do not like writing creatively. If I have a deadline for tomorrow and it's five o'clock in the afternoon, it's like, \"Okay, ChatGPT. I'm on my way to you.\" I tend to use ChatGPT the most because I don't know, I like Claude as well, but yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:03):\nOkay, awesome. I was going to ask which tool you use.

I'll just say, \"I need a 250 word post on,\" like today, today's post was a post that ChatGPT helped me with it. I said, \"I believe that there's a refrain that needs to happen with the soul. We tend to say, 'I have a soul, or I don't have a soul,' but what if my soul has me? What if in fact, my job is just to be this vehicle for my soul to go to the next lifetime?\"\n\n(01:09:56):\nMy job is to be this steward of the soul. I said, \"Write me something around that.\" It was just a weird idea. Of course, not all my blog posts are so new age, and I like that. I write a lot on leadership, but that was one that within 30 seconds, I had a 250 word blog post that I then adapted, and there you go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:19):\nAmazing. Chip, we've covered a lot of ground. We've gone through your entire life. Maybe actually just the tip of the iceberg. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nChip Conley (01:10:31):\nYes. Let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:32):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nChip Conley (01:10:38):\nMy favorite book of all time, Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl in a concentration camp in World War II. When someone's going through a hard time in their life, I say, \"Read that book. You'll realize it's not so bad, what you're going through.\" It also really speaks to this idea of despair equals suffering, minus meaning. I wrote a book called Emotional Equations that was a New York Times bestseller that spoke to this idea that what if you could take all of your emotions and turn them into equations?\n\n(01:11:04):\nVery engineering-minded of me. That's one. I love any book by Liz Gilbert, sort of the opposite. Elizabeth Gilbert wrote Eat, Pray, Love. Her book, she's on faculty at MEA. She teaches here. Big Magic is just a beautiful book about sort of how do you get in the flow to allow the genie to come through you. Her Ted Talk in 2009 was about the fact that genius is not about being the genius yourself. It's about being the receptacle for the genie to come through you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:44):\nI want to come back to this equation you shared. I was going to get to it, but I didn't, so this is a good opportunity to. There's a couple that are really interesting to me. This is, you wrote about these in a book. You have a bunch of these equations about living a happier life. The one you shared is despair equals suffering, minus meaning.\n\nChip Conley (01:12:00):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:01):\nThe implication there is if you want less despair, increase the meaning.\n\nChip Conley (01:12:05):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:05):\nOr reduce the suffering.\n\nChip Conley (01:12:06):\nSuffering, Buddhist philosophy, the first noble truth of Buddhism is that suffering is ever-present. If suffering's a constant and you have two variables, using some algebra, I guess, you know that if you have more meaning, you have less suffering. That's that one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:25):\nThe other one that I love is anxiety equals uncertainty times powerlessness. Maybe talk about that one briefly.\n\nChip Conley (01:12:32):\n98% of anxiety comes from two sources. One is what you don't know, and number two is what you can't control or influence, and based upon",

Maybe talk about that one briefly.\n\nChip Conley (01:12:32):\n98% of anxiety comes from two sources. One is what you don't know, and number two is what you can't control or influence, and based upon social science. You can create an anxiety balance sheet and create four columns. First column is what is it you do know about the thing that's making you anxious? The second column is, what is it you don't know? The third column is what is it you can control or influence? The fourth column is what is it you can't control or influence?\n\n(01:13:01):\nWhen you take free-floating anxiety and put it into an equation, it actually makes it more tangible, and you often are less anxious as a result.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:11):\nBoom. Okay, so if you're feeling anxious right now, this is an exercise you can do and you'll feel less anxious in like five minutes is what I'm hearing.\n\nChip Conley (01:13:19):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:19):\nOkay, excellent. Very, very good nugget of advice. Okay, let's keep going with the lightning round. Come back from our tangent. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nChip Conley (01:13:29):\nTed Lasso is, I'm a sucker for that show. When it comes to movies, I'm a total movie buff. We have an annual MEA Film Festival at our Santa Fe campus. I would say that the film that I'm most excited about that is coming out that most people have never heard of, it's called I'll Push You. It's the story of two guys, one of whom is in a degenerative health condition and in a wheelchair, and his best friend pushes him the 500 miles of the Camino de Santiago, and it's the relationship they build along that way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:08):\nAmazing. Very deep cut. Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nChip Conley (01:14:17):\nYes. Hair growing material. No. Do you know Viori shorts? I sound like Scott Galloway because he advertises this, but Viori shorts are like, I just love them. They're just breathe and they're comfortable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:33):\nI'm wearing Viori joggers right now. The one downside of Viori, not to make anyone mad, is they're kind of plasticky if you look at the material. I'm trying to like, I don't know, but I do love, there's nothing better. That's the problem. Anything else like this that is all cotton.\n\nChip Conley (01:14:50):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:51):\nI'm a fan. I have many Viori, I don't know if they're called joggers, just, I don't know, weekenders or something. Anyway, love you, Viori. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find really useful in work or in life? I imagine you have many, but is there one that comes to mind?\n\nChip Conley (01:15:07):\nMy favorite one right now is your painful life lessons are the raw material for your future wisdom. The premise of that is that wisdom often comes through the school of hard knocks. When you're in the midst of a really challenging time, you are developing your future wisdom that's going to be valuable to you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):\nOkay, final question. You were on the board of Burning Man, or you still are?\n\nChip Conley (01:15:28):\nI was.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):\nWas.\n\nChip Conley (01:15:34):\nI helped found the board of Burning Man. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:36):\nOkay. No big deal. I don't know if you know this, I got married at Burning Man. We had an unofficial wedding there on bicycles, so it's really meaningful to us. I've been there four or five times. What's something about Burning Man that maybe people don't know, some inside story or a really unexpected piece of the journey? I may imagine there's a lot, but what comes to mind?\n\nChip Conley (01:15:55):\nI would say the best not well-known thing about Burning Man is that Burning Man own owns a place called Fly Ranch. Fly Ranch is about 10 miles from Burning Man. Now, when you go to the Burn, the event around Labor Day, you cannot go over there. It's locked off. It's 3,400 acres. If you look at Fly Ranch, FlyRanch.org, I think it might even be, or it's on the Burning Man site, Fly Ranch is the opposite of Burning Man. Burning Man is this alkaline desert.\n\n(01:16:29):\nThere's no living life there at all. It's very masculine. Fly Ranch is porous, and lots of desert grasses, and hot springs, and hot pools, and birds, and wild horses, and it's one of my favorite hot springs places in the world. Just check it out, and you can go there when it's not during the event. It's quite beautiful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:57):\nIt feels like it might've inspired MEA in many ways.\n\nChip Conley (01:17:00):\nIt did,",

Where can folks find you online, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nChip Conley (01:17:08):\nOnline, MEAWisdom.com is the website for MEA. My website is ChipConley.com, C-O-N-L-E-Y, and I'm on LinkedIn. That's really, from a social media perspective, the thing that I do the most. I actually take my daily blogs and put them on LinkedIn. Then what your community can do, just come say hi, come check me out. If wisdom's interesting to you, and I think wisdom should be interesting to everybody here, on the MEA website, at the very bottom footer, you'll see a bunch of free resources.\n\n(01:17:43):\nOne of them is called Why Successful Leaders Value Wisdom. It is a free resource, and there's also a free resource down there called The Anatomy of a Transition. Those two free resources, understanding how to build your TQ, your transitional intelligence, and understanding how to develop wisdom are two, to my mind, two of the most important modern skills that we can have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:05):\nIt's funny when you say you're on LinkedIn. It doesn't resonate with me. Chip Conley on LinkedIn, posting on LinkedIn, something about...\n\nChip Conley (01:18:13):\nI don't know. Why? Because I'm a little too Burning Man?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:15):\nYou're just, yeah, exactly. It feels like that's not your vibe, but I love that you do it, because that's where the people are.\n\nChip Conley (01:18:21):\nOh, I put wild, weird stuff up on LinkedIn, and thank God somebody's doing that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:28):\nFor some reason, I don't see it. I need to fix that. Chip, this was incredible. Everything I was hoping it'd be, thank you so much for being here and for sharing-\n\nChip Conley (01:18:34):\nThank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:34):\n... your wisdom.\n\nChip Conley (01:18:35):\nI am so proud as I go back, like have your proud Papa who just loves to see you in your element, and I just want to make sure everybody knows the following. Lenny was so good to work with. Whenever you were assigned to a project as a PM, I appreciated it because I just knew that we were going to have great conversations. You're just an interesting dude.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:00):\nWell, I appreciate that, Chip. That's going to be the beginning of this whole episode. We're just going to put that up front. Just kidding. That was awesome, Chip. Really appreciate it.\n\nChip Conley (01:19:01):\nThanks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:08):\nThanks everyone for listening. Bye, everyone.

And hopefully you do, or it's pretty close to it and you just have to adjust a couple things, and you could be right back on track. But if you just assume you need to launch a new channel to fix this problem, you're going to be wrong, because your entire customer base changed, not just the next 10% of customers that you're looking for.\n\nLenny (00:00:34):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today, my guest is Adam Grenier. Adam was head of Growth Marketing and Innovation at Uber where he basically built their growth marketing infrastructure and the team from the ground up. Then he went on to VP of Product and Marketing at Lambda School, and most recently he was VP of Marketing at Masterclass. These days, Adam advises companies, large and small, on growth and marketing strategy.\n\nLenny (00:01:10):\nIn our conversation, we cover how to decide when to try new and emerging acquisition channels like TikTok, VR, newsletter ads, and how to go about testing them out. We get into the growth CMO role, which is an emerging role that Adam has helped pioneer, and we get into some real talk about burnout and depression and mental health issues that often come with working in tech. This was a really powerful and insightful conversation and I learned a lot from Adam both as an operator and as a human. I can't wait for you to hear this episode. And so with that, I bring you Adam Grenier.\n\nLenny (00:01:48):\nThis episode is brought to you by Whimsical.

Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:06):\nIt's my pleasure. I'm really excited to chat. So, I'm going to give a very brief overview of your very impressive career, and just let me know if I missed anything.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:04:15):\nAll right.\n\nLenny (00:04:15):\nSound good?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:04:15):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:04:17):\nOkay, so you were most recently VP of Marketing at Masterclass, which I'm actually a happy subscriber of and I've watched many a video. Before that, you were VP of Product and Marketing at Lambda School. I don't know if that's right before, but that was something you did. Also, you were head of Growth Marketing and Innovation at Uber, which is a really cool title. And I think you spent four years there and you basically built their growth marketing infrastructure and the team. And currently you're doing a bunch of advising and exploring to see what you want to do next. Is that about right?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:04:50):\nYeah, you hit most of the key points. I think pre-Uber, the first chunk of my career was on the advertising side, so worked in agency world. So, I kind of think of this as phase three",

I think pre-Uber, the first chunk of my career was on the advertising side, so worked in agency world. So, I kind of think of this as phase three of my life. Ads world was phase one, startup and growth world phase two, and now really just spending time helping entrepreneurs and founders and built companies and that type of stuff.\n\nLenny (00:05:16):\nWhat's been your favorite phase so far?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:05:18):\nI mean all of them. I just embrace what gets thrown at me and allow it to organically happen. So, each phase has had its pros and cons and ups and downs, and so I think they've all fit pretty well into where I was in my career.\n\nLenny (00:05:34):\nSpeaking of moving and adjusting and iterating, I know you're big into improv. How serious are you about improv?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:05:44):\nGood question. Serious in the sense that I've done it for a very long time and I still do it and I try to do it regularly. Serious as in am I aiming to make money off of it and have a career out of it? Unfortunately not. There was a point in my life that that is what I wanted to do. I lived in Chicago, did Second City ImprovOlympic, a variety of different places, did quite a bit of performing, but also got into corporate paychecks early as well.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:06:12):\nAnd so kind of built a lifestyle that made doing improv full time probably not the best path for me at the time. And so made a pretty conscious choice early on that it was more of a hobby and if something ever came of it, cool, but if not, that's okay. It's something I keep coming back to, because it's very grounding and fulfilling in ways that work and family life and things like that don't quite hit for me.\n\nLenny (00:06:34):\nActually at Airbnb we had an improv teacher come and work with the PM team. It was for months. We did improv games once a week.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:06:42):\nNice.\n\nLenny (00:06:43):\nAnd played all these fun things. And I'm curious what you've taken away from improv that has helped you become better at your work?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:06:51):\nSo, I think generally the whole suite of skills that you develop in improv are pretty applicable, right? Because you are getting comfortable on your feet with change, with teamwork, building off of each other, experimenting, trying new things, a little bit of everything. I think a couple of the key rules or themes of improv that I really try to hammer home with people are obviously the \"Yes, and...\" side of improv, which everyone's probably heard, which is in a scene the worst thing you could do is deny somebody, because you're actually just stopping progress and you're not building off of anything.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:07:27):\nSo, the appropriate approach is to say, \"Yes, that is true, and...\" and add to it. So, if someone's like, \"Hey, you have a chicken on your head,\" not saying, \"No, I don't.\" Just kind of ruins that scene. Versus saying, \"Yes, I do, and it's name is Sally. What's your chicken's name?\" Builds on that and gives it more opportunity. And so I think that in growth in business is super important to be able to say, \"Yes, I do see your idea,\" or \"Yes, we did accomplish this and this is what we want to do next and this is how it's going to build on it,\" I think is super important.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:07:59):\nThe other one that I think is less known or talked about is the gift of details. So, in a scene, if you give somebody really specific details about something, it gives so much more meat to be able to work off of in terms of what's coming next. So, if someone's starting a scene and they're clearly watching television and clicking through the channels and I walk up and just say like, \"Oh, you're watching TV, cool.\" That's a yes statement. I'm not denying what they did. But if I come up and say like, \"Oh cool, you're watching TV. Is that an Alf episode? I haven't seen Alf since I was a kid. It reminds me this one time I actually ate my own cat.\"\n\nAdam Grenier (00:08:39):\nJust giving those specific details of Alf and me as a kid and I had a cat, which if people don't know Alf, he ate cats.\n\nLenny (00:08:48):\nI don't remember that. I remember Alf, but I don't remember he ate cats.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:08:51):\nHe was always trying to get the family cat. So, those kinds of details add a ton of value and you take that into the business world, to use Masterclass for instance, if I say, \"Yeah, Masterclass, we've got this way to build content that is both entertainment and education,\" that's interesting. But if I say, \"We create content that is both education and entertainment to solve people's deep curiosities in the way that maybe a biography would.\" That just opens up the exact problem that you're trying to solve. What are other alternatives to that problem? How are people consuming that? So, I think the gift of details in good improv and learning",

Have you found it also to be helpful in collaboration like this \"Yes, and...\" piece? I'm curious, is there an example or story where you like \"Yes, and...\" someone? Do you actually say \"Yes, and...\" in a meeting? How do you actually find that you use it?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:09:58):\nI hear it every now and then. I don't usually literally say it. I think one of the areas that I've found it to be valuable is when you've got cross-functional work. So, obviously at Uber we dealt with city teams a lot, and so a lot of the times the way that the central team would scope a problem versus a local team would scope a problem, would almost feel at odds with each other. And if you approach it with that \"Yes, and...\", it's often still true.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:10:24):\nIt's like, oh, both of these things can be true at once. You could have a different goal than I have, or you have a system problem local to you that is important to you and it's not important to me. That's okay, both things can exist. So, now that we accept both and can work off of each other, we're more likely to build both a better rapport and energy among ourselves because we're not just saying, \"No, no, no, no, you're wrong. That's not true, that's not important to the business. Why are you doing that?\" That type of energy when cross-functional work, it just kills the scene, it kills that progress. And then you don't build relationships, you don't build the right solutions, all that type of stuff.\n\nLenny (00:11:06):\nIt sounds really good. Everyone in theory wants to be really good at this. And I imagine just doing a bunch of improv is a really good way to get better at not getting defensive and being like, \"Yes. And how do we make this idea better?\" Is there something you can advise folks to work on this skill, or is it just do a bunch of improv classes and it'll kind of help build that skill?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:11:25):\nThat's one. I would say that I'll say that all the time to people, \"Do some improv classes.\" And I get a lot of people like, \"No, I'm not funny,\" or, \"I don't want to do improv.\" And I think it's still a really great class to take, even if you have zero interest in doing improv, or public speaking, or any of that kind of stuff. Because, again, improv 101 is taught everywhere. Every city has it somewhere, and it's rarely ever people that are trying to do improv professionally. It's all games, like you said. The classes that you all did at Airbnb is what improv 101 is, right?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:12:00):\nIt's just like, \"Hey, let's just have fun. Let's just get out of our skin,\" and things like that. So, I do think everybody should take improv classes. I think it's also something with a lot of goals or skills that you want to develop, I think being really public and open about you wanting to develop that. So, if you are managing a team and you want to sharpen the skills, make it a team goal, or have accountability and just say, \"Hey guys, I know that I've been pushing back on things lately. I want to really try to embrace and grow off of ideas better, hold me accountable, call me out and be like, 'Adam, \"Yes, and...\" this please.\"\n\nAdam Grenier (00:12:32):\nOr giving people permission to push back on that when it doesn't happen, I think also just opens the door for more productive conversations with people and the ability to hold yourself accountable and keep trying it.\n\nLenny (00:12:47):\nI love that. And such a good team bonding activity. There's like all these reasons to do this as a team. My wife actually, she's a designer, artist, writer, illustrator kind of person, and she's been taking a lot of these sorts of classes to help inspire her creativity. She never wants to be an improv person, she did stand up classes.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:13:03):\nThat's awesome.\n\nLenny (00:13:05):\nAs you said, it just helps you get the juices flowing along these lines. Okay, so we're not going to talk about improv the whole time.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:13:13):\nWe could if you want to.\n\nLenny (00:13:15):\nWe could. Throw me word, let's go. No, we don't want to do that. So, there's basically three things I really wanted to chat about with you. One is how to decide when to invest in an emerging acquisition channel like TikTok, VR, Clubhouse was a big thing. You have some really interesting thoughts on how to decide and approach this thing. To the growth CMR role, which is kind of this, I think emerging role, something you're really good at,",

One is how to decide when to invest in an emerging acquisition channel like TikTok, VR, Clubhouse was a big thing. You have some really interesting thoughts on how to decide and approach this thing. To the growth CMR role, which is kind of this, I think emerging role, something you're really good at, and I just want to get your thoughts on what's happening there. And then, three, some real talk on burnout and depression that often comes with working in tech and stuff that we go through. Does that sound good?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:13:51):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:13:51):\nOkay, great. So, to start with in the first topic, if you think about it just every company essentially goes through this kind of S-curve of growth. They start slow, they find something that's working, then hopefully it works out and things start to grow, grow, grow, and then eventually it flattens out and you see this S-curve that happens. And every company is always trying to find the next S-curve to add this layer on the cake that keeps overall growth up while this first growth channel slows.\n\nLenny (00:14:18):\nAnd so people are always looking for what's the next thing? \"Oh man, Clubhouse is coming out. We should get on Clubhouse.\" \"Oh, TikTok is so hot, we've got to run some TikTok ads.\" And there's always something new, like newsletter ads, I don't know, podcast ads, if that's new. And you have a really interesting framework for how to think about this and make decisions and experiment. So, I'd love to hear insights there.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:14:38):\nSo, the exploring emerging channels framework that I'll take, either my teams or companies that I'm advising through, has three core ingredients that I like to spend time with. So, the first is really understanding if there is an overlap between what the customers need is, what your company's goals are, and what the channel actually does really well. So, the example I've used in the past is Spotify in the moment of things like Clubhouse and Paparazzi and stuff like that becoming really popular.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:15:14):\nWell, for Spotify, they're trying to get more people to consume music and be entertained by music and things like that. And it's all audio driven. And so their growth goals are probably around new customers or deeper engagement with audio. The customer's needs are discovery and more ways to maybe have deeper relationships with their music. If you're a jazz fan, can you learn new jazz artists or more about the artists that you love? Things like that. And then take those two channels. If you take something like Clubhouse, it's audio first, it's almost like live podcast radio type feel to it.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:15:57):\nYou can get into these rooms with just people with really amazing esoteric knowledge about something. And so its strengths have a really clean overlap to me with the goals of Spotify, the needs of the customer and the strengths of that. And so that to me is great. That is probably a green light in terms of is it even worth our time? Versus Paparazzi is very photo driven and nothing really to do with music or anything like that. And so it's like even though Paparazzi might have become the best biggest channel ever, is that the thing you should be putting your time into? It would be a yellow light for me at best.\n\nLenny (00:16:36):\nAnd how did you describe that again? It's the medium matches?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:16:40):\nYeah, the strengths of the medium. So, let's take influencer right now. Actually two of the channels that a lot of people are talking about right now are streaming TV or OTT and influencer marketing. And so to me, one of the strengths of influencer marketing is hyper targeted contextual marketing. And so I can go find the five influencers that are hardcore Alf fans, and if I'm marketing Alf something, great, I can go find that specific thing. Whereas OTTs a lot harder to get that specific.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:17:16):\nOTT strength is broad reach and video storytelling and that type of stuff. So, it's like, okay, well maybe my medium is if I'm Masterclass and I have a ton of video content and storytelling and things like that, that channel actually makes a ton of sense probably. So, it's like what are the strengths of that channel is something that... that is actually probably the piece I see people ignore the most, which is they just want to know if a channel is hot or not. And this gets especially hairy in this world of a lot of B2B doing more consumer-esque marketing. There's so many B2B companies that just don't apply to emerging consumer channels.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:18:00):\nAnd it's just like, please just stop. I don't need a Notion Clubhouse channel this week. And maybe there's a world to do that. But I think that's kind of number one, is making sure that there's even a reason that you should be there to put it on your radar right now.\n\nLenny (00:18:19):\nAwesome. What does the OTT stand for by the way?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:18:22):\nOh my gosh, you're putting it on the spot.\n\nLenny (00:18:24):\nIt's all good.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:18:25):\nI'm drawing a blank on it.\n\nLenny (00:18:26):\nBut essentially it's a streaming platform?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:",

Over the top. So, instead of it being cable TV, it's coming from a box. So, it's primarily if you think of ads on Amazon or Hulu or even if you go to cnn.com and you start streaming and you get an ad first. it's basically video ads, but a lot of them now are happening on televisions and on streaming services rather than just on websites.\n\nLenny (00:18:55):\nGot it. Okay, cool. So, the first is the strength of the channel. You should look at that.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:18:59):\nYep. And how that overlaps with your customer and your business needs. The second is the channel DNA. And so this is looking at things like where are they in their trajectory? So, Clubhouse is actually a perfect example, because in a weird way, so Clubhouse got hot before Facebook got cold. And I was pretty amazed how many more people were trying to crack Clubhouse than TikTok, because TikTok hadn't really released their ads solution yet, but neither had Clubhouse. But everybody was talking about Clubhouse, and TikTok is very clearly not going away anytime soon, where Clubhouse hopefully won't. Like this is an amazing product.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:19:41):\nI really enjoyed it and loved it, but it was clearly very early, very quickly at that point of hotness where everyone was just kind of, \"That's the reason I should be there.\" And part of this reason is to accept the risks of going into that channel. So, if I go and dedicate two quarters of work to Clubhouse, I need to accept that they are so early in this curve that there's a good chance this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and it'll be over. It's not a repeatable action. It also is important because if you get something to work on a channel that's earlier in their growth curve, the likelihood that they will change is very high.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:20:23):\nYou're going to need to commit a lot of cycles to keep it going, because it's like, \"Okay, well, their product is going to evolve drastically very quickly over the next two years.\" And so a really great example is Facebook early... I was at Zoosk. And so Zoozk and companies like Zynga got tons of their early growth because of notifications on Facebook, which was one of their early features, which allowed basically anybody that took any action on Zynga, it would post on everybody else's page that you got 10 carrots, and that was a huge growth lever.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:20:59):\nBut then Facebook just pulled the plug on that. And so it's like, well, if you put all of your energy into that and that's it, it was pretty clear that that was still an area that's like this may not last forever. The last thing on the channel DNA that I like to look at that's a little bit more, I don't know if odd or unusual is the right term, is I like to spend a lot of time thinking about how they monetize. What is the monetization strategy of the channel? And the reason is because if you, as a business, can match or support their monetization strategy, it actually gives you a really interesting leg up with that channel.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:21:37):\nBecause the likelihood of you being able to call them up and go do custom stuff with them, or partner with them, or that your solutions will actually stick around for a while, it'd go up pretty drastically. And so my key example of this was with when Facebook started exploring mobile ads, Hotel Tonight, we were one of the alpha testers of mobile ads, because I'd been sitting here buying ad inventory on networks for the last five or six years and just waiting for Facebook to work, because it just wasn't really working for mobile installs.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:22:13):\nAnd it's like, I know this is a huge channel because I can use it on my online marketing, my web marketing, but as a mobile acquisition it's nowhere near as efficient as a lot of these other networks. And so as soon as they were doing that, I was able to basically position and say, \"Look it, you want to work with us. Let me into your alpha, because I have five years of experience already buying mobile ads. I know the space. I know it'll work. And if you get us to work, we're a killer case study, because we are a non-game and a lot of money is spent on gaming, but there's these whole other major categories that you're going to need other than gaming examples within that group. So, you're going to be able to use me as a case study and a lot of different scenarios than the gaming players.\"\n\nAdam Grenier (00:22:59):\nAnd so I was spending a lot less than the gaming players, but because of that understanding that your goal at Facebook is to make ads work for all of travel and for all of leisure and those kinds of things, that's the value of working with me. So, that's another piece of the channel DNA I like people to focus on.\n\nLenny (00:23:18):\nAwesome. That's such a good one, because to your point, if your goals are aligned, they're going to be like, \"Yes, let's",

That's such a good one, because to your point, if your goals are aligned, they're going to be like, \"Yes, let's make this happen.\" And it always feels like it's this behemoth that doesn't want to talk to any new startups, but if you can make the case of this is going to help you and the way you laid out is so clear, it's such a good idea.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:23:35):\nAnd especially with emerging channels, right? Because their whole thing is that make this work for a long time. It's part of the challenge you see with some new channels flipping to the other side of growing an ads business, will gravitate towards like, \"I want to get Disney on here,\" but Disney is very campaign driven, or they have been traditionally, where it's like you may get one big paycheck from them, but that doesn't... The way that UA driven gaming works is you get that to work, that's a gift that keeps on giving forever, right? Because there's not one of those companies, there's thousands of them and they all do the same thing. So, being able to drive that conversation is really helpful.\n\nLenny (00:24:18):\nCool.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:24:18):\nAnd then the third main ingredient is just your own company DNA. And so I think risk profile is a big one. Do you actually have comfort in being a first mover, a true first mover? Nobody knows anything, tracking's not going to work, it's not going to be programmatic. You're probably going to show up on content that's offensive. You're probably going to ask for refunds that won't happen. It's going to be really painful to be a true first mover. Do you have that appetite? Do you have the staff to actually be able to put someone on that and it not distract from everything else?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:24:53):\nAnd then the other piece on the company side is just your current channel mix. There's very few companies that I recommend saying, \"Yes, go put energy on this brand new channel that you don't know how to scale yet before you've figured out some type of volume on Google and Facebook.\" Every now and then there may be a perfect fit where it's like, absolutely, you should be the person doing this. But if you're not at least getting something out of the basic channels that everybody else is using, it's probably not the thing you should be putting your first energy into. It should be like, \"Great, I've got a good foundation.\" Like you said, now we're at that stage of trying to add things, tends to be a better stage to do more risky exploration into new channels.\n\nLenny (00:25:40):\nWhat advice do you have or can you give to founders teams that are trying to test one of these in terms of just how to run these tests? How much time should they spend, would you say? What do they look for? I know that this is a hard question and super dependent on the situation, but any advice there?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:25:55):\nSo, I think going through those three ingredients should help shape that answer, right? Because if you're like, \"Okay, well, the first one is super strong, the channel DNA is maybe really early and I've got a small to mid-size team and maybe only one channel working,\" then it may be like, \"Great. Put half of one person into this, because it's maybe interesting. But don't put any more than that into it.\" Versus if it's like, \"Man, this is a killer fit the channel's a little further along and I have a 20 person team, so I'm going to put three dedicated people to this, because we are in prime position to be the leaders in this new channel and really push it.\"\n\nAdam Grenier (00:26:36):\nSo, I think it's figuring those pieces out, because it is a very it depends answer, but rarely ever is it like, \"Hey, this should be your entire team's focus for the next three sprints or five sprints.\" I think that if you've got that half person working on it for a while and there starts to be some magic happening, sure, put a sprint or two against it as a whole team. But generally speaking, I think keeping it minimum at first is my typical recommendation.\n\nLenny (00:27:06):\nI had another guest, Yuri, who I think from former Grammarly, and he made a really good point that it's often better not to try something than to do it badly and then take away the wrong lessons. I guess, in your experience, what's a timeframe you think people should put into this stuff? You said two sprints, maybe a couple weeks. I don't know, what's the range of just maybe don't spend more than X months on something new if it's not clearly working, just based on your experience.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:27:33):\nGenerally I wouldn't let anything bleed past a quarter. You can probably get some good signal in a month or less, what I would call fishing. It wouldn't be like you're just putting bait in the water to figure out where the fish are, not necessarily getting statistically significant repeatable solutions. The big variables that can change that timing, so if I'm exploring a new video channel, the content I need to create is if I'm going to have to create something that takes three weeks to produce and $20,000 to make, I may want to give it a little",

It's like, great, I can do that by myself at midnight and it's not distracting anybody or anything. And if it doesn't work in three weeks, let's move on. But generally ideally what you're working through, and we'll touch a little bit more on this with the Growth CMO, is that this should all be part of a roadmap. It shouldn't just be randomly chosen and thrown at. This should be part of your sprint process and you should have a backlog of other things that you want to try. And so you're actually weighing that decision of how long based on what other opportunities you're missing out on by investing in that.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:28:57):\nBut I would say most channels, especially new ones, are going to take more than a couple cycles to kind of suss out. Because there's no rules, there's no playbooks yet on how to do them well. So, give it a little bit of time, but if you're going over a quarter and you don't feel like directionally it's getting better or it's interesting, I would put it back on ice for a while.\n\nLenny (00:29:18):\nCool. And to your point, you're not going to see any statistically significant answers. Is the thing you look for just like you know it when you see it? Oh wow, qualitatively feels like it's working kind of thing? Is that what you kind of look for?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:29:30):\nYeah, and I think define that going into it. What am I looking for, for this? So, something like Clubhouse I'm probably not going to see clicks. It's more about are we able to start a room and increase the size of that room by 10% every time that we run it? Okay great, that means that we're at least getting better at this and there's more reach available to us. But if we're getting 20 people every time we start a room and then it goes down to 15, then we're either not doing this well, the channel's not doing well, or there's just not enough reach for us to actually expand. Versus TikTok you might be able to say, \"Great, I can actually track clicks and conversion, so let's look at it the way we would any other channel.\"\n\nLenny (00:30:11):\nGot it. So, kind of look for momentum and that you're getting better and that it's moving somewhere. Awesome.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:30:16):\nYeah. Yep.\n\nLenny (00:30:17):\nCool. So, a question that I'm sure is on many people's minds that they would want to ask is, Adam, what are emerging platforms that are interesting right now that we should experiment with? What do you feel?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:30:28):\nSo, I mean I mentioned OTT, or basically the key thing with OTT is that it's way more trackable than traditional television, but it has similar value that traditional TV does in terms of the ability to do more long form storytelling type content, and a lot of it's not skippable if you buy it. And so those are reasons to be exploring that right now. It's hard for me to call that emerging channel, because it's been around forever. It's there's more of it and the tools and services around it are way better now than they were four years ago. And so I think the sophistication and ability to scale OTT is much higher now than ever before. Influencers probably the one that I'm most intrigued by, because similar to OTT, the scale and services and the ability to go do it is still there.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:31:19):\nIt's also got that hyper granularity that when I get into influencer tools, it feels to me like early Facebook when I used to go be able to target Lenny, or 10 people that have exactly the same likes as Lenny. And that type of stuff where it's like you can get so specific and find exactly who you need. It's incredibly tedious and manual and it's a lot of relationship management. So, I'm also keeping an eye on the technology being built around influencer, because I think that's a huge area of opportunity for entrepreneurs right now.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:31:57):\nBut generally speaking, the scope and opportunity there is huge and it's not going away, but it feels very new and different right now. And it supplements the ability to do some hyper level targeting that you've not been able to do, that Facebook and Google are getting less open about at the same time. I think VR is really interesting in the way that mobile was interesting before iPhone Three, where it was if you've got a VR app, it's a really interesting space, but if you don't, it's not that interesting to me yet.

There's still a ton to do there and influencers is also weird, because it crosses all of these other worlds as well. But I think TikTok is actually hyper interesting and everyone should be doing that. But I think of that less as you should be doing it as should I do it, should I not? And it's more I need to figure out how to do Facebook if I'm at least mildly appropriately should be there.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:33:05):\nThe podcast ads I think are great. I think that I bought podcast ads 15 years ago, so it doesn't feel like an emerging channel to me. I think there's way more volume now than there's ever been before. One of the guys that was on my team at Uber has a company that's doing programmatic buying and that type of stuff. And so I think there's more opportunities on podcast. I think people want to treat it like Facebook ads or direct response ads, immediate response ads. And actually what I keep seeing as the effective strategy with podcast ads is treating them more like radio where it's more about getting on the right program, making it personal and feel like it should be part of that program, and then repeating over and over and over again.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:33:53):\nSo, I think podcast is super interesting. I think it's just hard to scale. It's likely not going to get people the same volumes as the Googles and Facebooks of the world.\n\nLenny (00:34:01):\nCue our mid-roll ad. I'm excited to chat with my friend John Cutler from Podcast sponsor, Amplitude. Hey John.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:34:08):\nHey, Lenny. Excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:34:10):\nJohn, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics, but now you're getting into experimentation and even just launched a CDP. What's the thought process there?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:34:21):\nWell, we've always thought of Amplitude as being about supporting the full product loop. Think collect data, inform bets, ship experiments and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. So, the big aha was seen how many customers were using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach and send data to other destinations. Experiment and CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.\n\nLenny (00:34:42):\nAnd supporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:34:46):\nYeah. So, Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched starter templates and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growth.\n\nLenny (00:34:55):\nAbsolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John, and head to amplitude.com to get started.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:35:01):\nI also come from a very consumer perspective. I'm actually stronger on B2B companies using podcasting, because it has that exact same value I just described, but each one of their customers is substantially more valuable. So, they don't need the scale that a consumer application or product would need.\n\nLenny (00:35:20):\nYep. That's exactly who I work with usually. One last question on this topic. What percentage of the time do you find that an emerging channel works? Is it like 20% of the time, 10%, 5%? What should people estimate, it's probably not going to work but when it does it's going to be game changing?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:35:34):\nLike 5% of the time. There's new things popping up all the time. I think the area that I think of as emerging that I've found more success in is taking things that exist already and make them... so the two slices of it are either it's existed for a long... like podcasting. So, it existed for a long time and now we're finally getting to a spot where it feels scalable. The other is existing channels that introduce something brand new.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:36:04):\nSo, at the mobile ads I described on Facebook, pre mobile install ads and post. Those first 18 months of mobile install felt like an emerging channel, right? Because they were changing the product every week and tracking didn't work, and there were all these funky problems with it even though Facebook had been around forever. But brand spanking new channels, I don't know, they rarely work or are worth the effort early that you hope that they will be.\n\nLenny (00:36:35):\nCool. But when they work, it's game changing I imagine. Reminds me Apples coming out with Apple TV, I think it was, and they're just like, \"Hey Airbnb, you should make it app for Apple TV. It'll be huge.\" And there's a team put on it. I don't know. They spent a month building this app and did a bunch of nothing as far as I understand, but it felt good. It felt good to be part of the launch. One question I wanted to come back to, are there tools that you recommend for influencer marketing that you want to plug, or point out?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:37:01):\nWe were using Grin at Masterclass, we onboarded them.

One question I wanted to come back to, are there tools that you recommend for influencer marketing that you want to plug, or point out?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:37:01):\nWe were using Grin at Masterclass, we onboarded them. So, there's probably half a dozen companies in that same zone where they're building tools that allow you to do the discovery of influencers, the CRM of those influencers, and also often the measurement and payments and all that kind of stuff. So, it's an all in one type of management platform. That being said though, like I said, it's still super manual. It's nice to be able to go and find this list of 50 influencers that are the exact right influencer for this class launch, or whatever it might be.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:37:34):\nBut it's still then I have to wait till they all respond to me and there's still a lot of manual back and forth. So, that's probably one of them. I'm trying to think of... There's a few other in that same category that are competitive with Grin that they all seem equally pretty good. I can't even remember the reason we chose Grin over some of the other ones.\n\nLenny (00:37:53):\nIt's a good name.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:37:53):\nIt was all pretty close.\n\nLenny (00:37:55):\nSweet. Okay. If any other comes to mind, we'll throw it in the show notes. Before we get to the growth CMO discussion, there's kind of this tangential area that I wanted to spend a little time on, which is this idea of as a startup you initially should and often do start with a very narrow audience, your early adopters. I read this post about calling them your super specific who, and eventually you want to cross the chasm and go broader. And you have some interesting insights on how to think about that, and when to do that. Can you talk about that?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:38:26):\nYeah. So, I think the book, Crossing the Chasm, is a great place to start in terms of thinking about the broader topic of that. What I see missed a lot of the time that I like to spend time with people on is to really understand that those early adopters are often just drastically different than the broad audience. And spending time to actually figure that out and map out what you need to see with those early adopters to have confidence that the product is actually going to have product market fit beyond them.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:39:07):\nSo, I don't have anything hyper specific to add to that necessarily, or happy to dig in deeper to it, but it's probably the biggest challenge that I've seen with a lot of companies that I've worked with. And then as I do more investing and things like that, it's probably the biggest flag that I see with a lot of companies that claim to have product market fit, which is your TAM and your product market fit are not using the same definition. And that problem I think is often just a red flag for a lot of companies that I meet.\n\nLenny (00:39:40):\nGot it. So, essentially you often underestimate how challenging it'll be to grow from your initial early adopter crowd. Is there an example of that happening where a company just got screwed because they didn't think about that enough? Or is there something someone can do early on? Is it test a little bit more broadly early? What do you recommend there?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:39:59):\nI mean Clubhouse might be a good example in the sense that they leaned into the broader audience maybe quicker than they should have. Their product market fit seemed to fit the moment in time and could they have built some experiments, or tools, or features that maybe stress tested will this work in an ongoing fashion? If they were on such tear, that's a pretty hard decision to make, I'm sure.\n\nLenny (00:40:29):\nSo hard, it's easy in hindsight.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:40:33):\nI think that's another piece of it is that the audience changes aren't always just literal people. Even right now, one of the biggest pieces of advice I'm giving to people that are like, \"How should we adjust our marketing with the economic changes and things like that?\" I was like, \"Start by assuming you no longer have product market fit, because you had product market fit in a different market. It's a different market now, so you have to start over.\"\n\nAdam Grenier (00:40:57):\nAnd hopefully you do, or it's pretty close to it and you just have to adjust a couple things and you can be right back on track. But if you just assume you need to launch a new channel to fix this problem, you're going to be wrong, because your entire customer base changed, not just the next 10% of customers that you're looking for.\n\nLenny (00:41:14):\nIt's just a reminder of how freaking hard startups are. Man, we have product market fit. Okay, we're done. Let's move on.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:41:21):\nNot anymore.\n\nLenny (00:41:21):\nNot anymore. Oh man. Okay, sweet. So, onto this next topic around the Growth CMO. So, you're this really interesting combination of marketing brain and also very analytical growth person, and I think you refer to this as Growth CMO, which I don't actually hear the term much. So, I'm curious, what is a Growth CMO? How do you define it? And why is it important?",

So, I'm curious, what is a Growth CMO? How do you define it? And why is it important?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:41:43):\nYeah, so it's something I've just spent a lot of the last few years thinking about, specifically because now I've been at a handful of companies where we've brought in CMOs that in all ways are absolute world class CMOs, and they don't last, they don't fit and they don't succeed. And so I've spent a lot of time and figuring, well, why not? Some of it coming because of spending time with those people being like, \"Why are you doing it this way? That's not how a company at our stage operates.\"\n\nAdam Grenier (00:42:18):\nTrying to do it the way that a traditional CMO would've done marketing for a company, et cetera. One of the key examples I like to use is brand, in that everybody when they think about brand they think of it as an action, not as a consistent ongoing investment, or they think about it as campaigns and things like that. And from planning to execution to learnings, a traditional CMO will drive learnings and identify learnings. And in my mind, I think a Growth CMO is looking at each brand investment as how do you then immediately follow that up with the next one? How do you shift to this fast product iteration mindset with even things like brand?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:42:58):\nIt's very possible, but it's so counter to a lot of traditional marketing DNA. That, to me, means that we have a lot of mismatch marketing leadership, and that quickly eliminates trust with the marketing organization. It means that we rename everything marketing to product led growth, or growth, or referral programs. To me, it actually dilutes the value of marketing should be playing in the company. And it doesn't mean that the traditional marketing CMO isn't a good fit for some companies.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:43:37):\nI think the direct to consumer products are still very well suited to have a more traditional CMO. But I think product driven companies, product led companies, if you are CMO and your product leader aren't married at the hip, you're just missing out on just tons of opportunity, and the likelihood of things actually working very well consistently and compounding on each other.\n\nLenny (00:44:05):\nSo, what are the attributes of this person of what you call a Growth CMO? Sounds like partly it's being much more performance driven. Sounds like a big part of it is understanding product and not creating these silos. We're going to market the thing, you guys go build this thing. But also as a person, that's a great CMO. What else do you look for?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:44:22):\nSo, I would say so data driven generally. To me performance is a very loaded word in our world, because people think, especially in marketing, think that means not brand. But they're very data driven. And so when we take things like retention and even brand and the consideration funnel and, yes, you can't measure those exactly like you can measure landing page clicks and sales, but you absolutely can measure them. And making that part of the DNA of everything that's happening, data being part of that, I think is pretty quintessential of being a growth driven CMO.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:45:00):\nThe second, I think, is the iteration process is not thinking about things and, \"Hey, we need to plan for the next 24 months,\" but you can still do that and you can still have a vision and everything. But having that more of a agile type approach to everything. And again, this could be the storytelling that your sales people are doing, to what are your landing pages look like, to what is the design of your logo, to the brand itself. All of those things, like being more open to everything being possibly iterated on, on a regular basis using data to validate that and challenge what has worked for you.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:45:38):\nWe live in such a real time world now, especially with product driven companies. The things change so quickly. If you as a marketing leader aren't being iterative and thoughtful about things with it, you'll get eaten alive. And then I think experimentation is just a huge piece of it. And something that I see a lot of more traditional marketing leaders, the idea of experimentation is try a new channel. It's not like how do we experiment with our brand? How do we experiment with the funnel? The whole picture, not just the top of the funnel or the external elements of it.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:46:17):\nOne of the things that I haven't quite figured out the right language to put against this, but the traditional model of marketing is the four P's, product, placement, promotion, pricing. And in my mind, the world that we live in now, product is no longer a part of marketing, but it's actually they're married at the hip. They're one and the same, and most companies aren't operating that way. They're still operating as if they're two wildly different things. Even if they say they're working together, it's still, there's not. And to me it's just like, no, no, the product, it is the company now.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:46:59):\nAnd the marketing is integrated with literally every single piece of it.

And to me it's just like, no, no, the product, it is the company now.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:46:59):\nAnd the marketing is integrated with literally every single piece of it. A lot of traditional marketing got established in the 1920s and the 1950s around products that took years to develop or try, or a product team was a science group trying new flavors of cereal. And so the marketing team owned the box, where it went on the shelf and what the price was and all of those kinds of things was marketing, because product was such a wildly different part of the organization. And I think still there's just a lot of fundamental things that marketers think about that are stuck in that world, because most haven't had to grow through the true growth of a business that's just being established today.\n\nLenny (00:47:53):\nAnd the assumption is every software company should be hiring a CMO that is of this sort, of a Growth CMO, right?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:48:01):\nYeah. And I would say that my sense is that there's very few marketing leaders that can't be a Growth CMO. So, I don't think you have to have come up as a performance driven experimentation. It's more about adapting and growing. And again, the fundamentals are all the same. One of my pet projects that I haven't done anything with yet, is that every time something new comes out in the growth world, I go back in history as far as I can to try to find the earliest example of that. Just to be able to say, \"Look, this isn't new, but we can learn from the way that Coca-Cola invented the coupon.\"\n\nAdam Grenier (00:48:37):\nThe first known coupon was Coca-Cola giving away Coke for free, but it was actually a marketplace, because what they would do is they would go to a town and they would go to the soda fountain and they would give a free Coke syrup to that side of the market and they would give coupons to the other side of the market to spark it, to get it going. And then it's like, well, now all the customers want Coke, now you need to supply it, you'll pay for it. And learning that and understanding that is really cool. And it's just interesting to me, because I'm a huge nerd.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:49:09):\nBut that to me is all of the things that great marketing leaders have learned are right, it's the operating aspect of those insights and those skills and understanding your customer and their psychology. All of those things have stayed the same. It's the operating of it in the way a growth organization, like a product driven growth organization operates, is very fundamentally different than the way a traditional marketing run organization had run.\n\nLenny (00:49:37):\nI was going to ask you what a marketing leader can do to evolve into this where you think things are going, and your point about you're capable of it, you can iterate and adapt is really great and empowering. Is there anything specific they can do to learn how to do this better, other than is it like mentorship? Is there classes, courses? Just do the job, figure it out? Do you have anything you can suggest there to folks listening and they're like, \"Oh, shit. I'm in trouble?\"\n\nAdam Grenier (00:50:02):\nHonestly, I think learn product development. Go learn agile product development. And there's actually a book called Hacking Marketing, I think. I'll confirm. But it's essentially how to run a marketing team on Agile. That to me is just, again, any great marketing leader should be able to go and consume how to do product development, how to run a product like sprints and those types of things. And their mind, if they're great marketing CMO or a CMO, will be like, \"Oh my gosh, I could do this with this big event that we want to host. I could do this with everything.\"\n\nAdam Grenier (00:50:43):\nThere's nothing off the table when you actually learn those fundamentals. But as well as I know smart people can learn that stuff. There's lots of resources out there. Reforge has some classes on it, there's a bunch of new product led growth classes out in the wild, like Maven I think has a couple. And there's a variety of those types of things that just going and doing it, you don't have to go and operate it yourself. You don't have to go become a product manager. But understanding those skills and those systems will, one, I think make you think differently about how to run your marketing team and, two, make you exponentially better at working with your product organization.\n\nLenny (00:51:21):\nAwesome. I'm actually hearing from folks listening to this podcast not live right now, but broadly, that this is a good way to learn how product works and how product leaders think. So, that's interesting. So, if you're listening to this, good job. You also mentioned that a lot of marketing leaders don't work out at a company, they join, they leave, things go wrong. As a hiring founder or leader, what do you look for to tell you this person's probably not what we need and not what you'd call a Growth CMO? What are flags that are like they're probably not going to adapt and evolve to the way we want to operate?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:51:53):\nSo, I think first and foremost, it obviously depends on the stage.

Anything let's say C or below, comfortable with chaos and willingness to go do something they have not done for probably 15 years are two huge signals for me, because every company I've been part of at every scale now, which is all of them basically, that's the thing that a lot of people coming from more traditional marketing environments into startup worlds, it's a pace and just the unpredictability and change and those kinds of things are just at such a higher rate than they've seen for a long time that it can be really jarring for people.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:52:49):\nAnd I think it's totally reasonable. It's crazy, right? If anybody that's had the exposure on both sides. And then the willingness to go do the work. People are churning constantly and the challenges are different every week and those types of things. And so it's like every now and then you've got to go write an email or you've got to go open up Facebook and get into the weeds with it with your team, into the data of it and that type of stuff. And that's stuff that I don't want to do, personally, me. I'm past the point where I should be in Facebook.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:53:17):\nBut man, when I need to, I'm willing to, and I'll go get in the weeds with it and I'll use my time to just be like, \"Look, we have to figure this out now.\" And I'm going to go do the things that I thought I was done with in my career. So, those are pretty big ones. I think then generally speaking, one of the exercises I like to take founders through when they're hiring a marketing leader is every marketer is going to have a T-shaped career.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:53:41):\nEverybody came from something they probably became awesome at and then over time just expanded their purview. So, for me it was mobile. I got into mobile. My first client ever was on Sun Microsystems early 2000s, getting Java developers to make apps for flip phones. So, I just knew digital mobile world really, really well before a lot of people did. But then eventually I'm like, \"Great, now I'm running an entire digital marketing team. Now I'm running an entire marketing team. Now I'm getting into growth. Now I want to learn product,\" and I've expanded. And so typically it's going through that exercise of find out their T, find out their strength, and then spend time figuring out how they make up for those other things.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:54:24):\nSo, for me, at Lambda school I ran our PR team for a while. I am not a PR person, but I make it a goal in my life to get to the valley of despair of the Dunning-Kruger effect, to be like, \"Great, I just need to know how bad I am at PR,\" because if I still think I'm good at it, that's not a good place for me to be. But once I know how bad it is, I now know I need to go hire the right person to come in and I'm going to listen to them. I'm not going to assume that I'm smarter than them, and those types of things. And so I think the same thing with product questions and data questions and experimentation questions for this concept of a Growth CMO is like, well, somebody's coming from a world where they've not had to work really closely with the product team, spend time with them to figure out how they plan on adapting to that.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:55:12):\nMy guess is most won't have thought of that. The good ones will be able to figure it out together with you in that interview, or afterwards, or whatever it might be.\n\nLenny (00:55:22):\nAwesome. Maybe one day we'll do a follow-up chat just to dive into hiring a marketing person. I know that's a whole deep topic.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:55:31):\nLots of thoughts.\n\nLenny (00:55:31):\nOkay. Oh man. Okay. We've got to book that. But, okay. So, you mentioned the valley of despair, and that's a good segue to our next topic. So, I found this old tweet of yours where you talk about burnout and depression, and you kind of make this point that a lot of times you feel like it's burnout and it's actually depression. And just broadly mental health is just this topic that's not really spoken a lot about in tech and in business. And so I'd love to just spend a little time on this. I know you're a big proponent of talking about these sorts of things, so I'm curious, I know you've been through both these things and I'm curious just to hear your journey, what that's been like, and what you've learned about how to get through it?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:56:08):\nSo, the two biggest inputs for me in terms of really taking the time to understand my mental health, one is my wife, who's been a very strong proponent of mental health resources for everybody since I met her. And so just being able to learn from her and get exposure to, well, why is this important? What are the values of it? And seeing it pretty regularly of family members, or coworkers. Or it's like, oh man, I bet there's something deeper here that maybe is important for them to figure out.\n\nLenny (00:56:46):",

Or it's like, oh man, I bet there's something deeper here that maybe is important for them to figure out.\n\nLenny (00:56:46):\nIs that just something she's good at, or is she trained in this stuff?\n\nAdam Grenier (00:56:49):\nNo, she's good at it and she's in therapy and stuff like that. She's one of the most empathetic, passionate people I've ever met in my life. And so she just feels like poor people so much that I think it's something really important to her. And then at Uber, I got to a spot where I was incredibly exhausted and tired and just down, not excited about work and things like that, and so I started going to therapy and with this assumption that I was just working too hard.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:57:20):\nThat was kind of my like, \"Man, I need to go to therapy to figure out the tools that I need to deal with me working too hard.\" And I just uncovered so many interesting things that I wouldn't have expected. So, one was that I'm the youngest child in my family and I did something pretty different than a lot of my relatives and things like that. So, recognition is something I long for, and it turns out I get that at work and I just hadn't gotten that in other parts of my life. And so this thing that I'm like, \"This is my problem,\" was actually a solution to my real problem.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:57:58):\nAnd knowing that just helped me totally just change my perspective of how hard I work. I was getting judgemental about myself around, \"Man, I'm working too hard. I shouldn't be doing this, but I have to.\" And then I got in the spot where I'm like, \"Oh, I'm working hard because I love it, because I like it, I'm having an impact and I'm working with people I like and people respect the work that I do.\" And that helped me identify that I can work just as hard, but I can work smarter. I can work more on the things I have impact on.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:58:30):\nI can work more with people that actually respected the type of work that I'm doing. And that actually just started to relax me and get me to the spot of, \"Oh, okay,\" I still some burnout in there, and that's part of the innovation. Part of my title was that I got to a spot where I'm like, I was traveling constantly, I had teams all over the world and the structure of Uber was working where every city had a GM and I was the person they called when their spend was too high. And so 500 GMs-\n\nLenny (00:59:05):\nUber GMs especially.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:59:06):\nYeah, exactly. And so I was working in a world where I was dealing with a lot of politics. I love mentoring people, and I had this massive team of 150 people that I barely know any of them. And so I'm not mentoring people either anymore. And I just felt like I'm working so hard on things that I actually don't enjoy. And so I'm like, I'm going to go work on flying cars, which is a whole other podcast too. So, that was my, okay, there was burnout in there.\n\nAdam Grenier (00:59:33):\nI know that was a fact, but some of those feelings or things that I felt my entire life that I uncovered that I thought was just burnt out, I was like, \"Oh, actually at this point in my life, this point in my life and this point in my life, I felt this way too. And at those points I wasn't burnt out. And so I actually have deeper work to do here and deeper understanding of myself so that I can actually maximize my life and enjoy it.\" And because I'm going to keep working to some degree this hard. And I want to just make the most of that.\n\nLenny (01:00:03):\nI don't know if you mentioned this, but I imagine parts of those points were depression, not burnout. What have you found to be that line of just like, \"Oh wow, this is a lot more serious than I'm just working way too hard?\"\n\nAdam Grenier (01:00:14):\nFor me, it's hard to describe, but I personally now can pretty cleanly tell the difference between exhaustion and depression. And it tends to tie to my broader motivations, not just my motivation to work. So, when I'm exhausted, I'll still show up to work, I'll still execute, I'll still do those types of things, but I'm going to go and if I can take an improv class, it's going to be a blast. I'm going to enjoy it and I'm going to love it. If I'm depressed, I won't go to that improv class. I'll just cancel it. I won't go to it. Or if I go to it, I'll go home immediately. One of the things I love about actual improv classes, is the community. Is, \"Hey, let's all go grab a drink now.\" And this is a totally different group of people. It's not my family, it's not my work people, it's just me.\n\nAdam Grenier (01:01:17):\nAnd I wouldn't do that. And so it's kind of noticing where else is this impacting and to what degree and why, can help me understand what's going on in my life. Because more often than not, I can then take those",

Because more often than not, I can then take those feelings and it'll be like, \"Oh, I've felt this way for three weeks now. I should think about this and dissect it a little bit.\" And so again, I'll spend time with my therapist. One of the tools that my therapist has given me is to open up with my friends and have these conversations with my friends. And so now I went from five, six years ago really just having my therapist or my wife to talk about this kind of stuff to, I don't know, I have five or six different friends that we're massively transparent with each other about this stuff, because the second I shared any of this with them, they shared it with me.\n\nAdam Grenier (01:02:06):\nAnd now we've become safe places to have those conversations where I can be like, \"Hey, there's this thing going on.\" My dad has ALS and so he's been really sick and I've got three kids and I've got jobs and work and money and the market crash. And there's so many different things. It's like, okay, let me actually figure out which one of these things is causing this energy right now. And having many years of therapy now and those resources can help me get to that solution to get to that answer so that I can figure out, okay, what do I need to do right now? Do I need to actually take time for myself and dig deeper into these personal things? Do I actually need to change something with the shape of my career? Those types of things.\n\nLenny (01:02:47):\nAwesome. And it sounds like the things that have been most helpful, and I'm curious what else you'd recommend to folks that are maybe feeling some of this. So, it sounds like therapy is really powerful, your partner and being open to your partner, finding a group of friends where you could be transparent about these sorts of things. Is there anything else you suggest folks look into?\n\nAdam Grenier (01:03:04):\nYeah. So, I think meditation's a good one. The startup people love to talk about meditation, and so you can find lots of ways to do that. It's kind of evolved for me. So, it's in that tweet thread and I can't remember it now. There was a meditation thing that was the first, it almost felt like Noom for me for meditation where it wasn't just-\n\nLenny (01:03:24):\nWaking Up, Sam Harris's-\n\nAdam Grenier (01:03:25):\nYeah, Waking Up where it's like I'm actually learning about meditation, not just learning how to meditate. And that's how my brain likes to do things. I'm a lifetime learner, I love digging into things. I learned breathing techniques and things like that, but going through that program of Waking Up was the first time I actually really appreciated when and how and where to do it. I'm still not a everyday meditate person.\n\nAdam Grenier (01:03:50):\nI now use, I'm an investor, so I'm biased, but Aura, A-U-R-A, which is a marketplace app. It's some of the other meditation apps, but it's a marketplace, so it's actually coaches and stuff adding content. So, I use that now as needed, which I really enjoy. The exercise and diet and those types of things definitely tie to it. It's like eating is a pretty clean signal for me, or snacking is a really clean signal, at least for me of like, okay, I'm snacking more than I should be, and eating healthy can both help me identify that I'm in those spots, but also just make me feel better.\n\nAdam Grenier (01:04:29):\nOne thing I would say is that the therapist that I found, I found through a service that we had at Uber, and I think I was surprised how much stuff is covered by companies in terms of the ability to find a therapist, pay for a therapist or other tools. And so that's one thing I would suggest, go look through your benefits. Your healthcare provider offers a lot of that stuff too. So, those are a handful of. Listen to Lenny's podcast?\n\nLenny (01:04:58):\nI hope that to be true. I don't know if that's anywhere near as powerful as these other things. One thing I'll mention is on the meditation front, there's this amazing book that kind of does exactly what you also describe where it teaches you why this works. It's called, it's kind of like a bad title, it's called Why Buddhism is True. And it's not trying to convince you to be a Buddhist, but it has a lot of incredible insights on why meditation is so powerful and how to think about it. So, I'll put that in the show notes too.\n\nAdam Grenier (01:05:24):\nAwesome.\n\nLenny (01:05:24):\nYeah.\n\nAdam Grenier (01:05:24):\nI'm going to check that out.\n\nLenny (01:05:25):\nI wanted to come back to the burnout piece. I imagine some folks are listening to this and they're like, \"Am I burnt out? I don't know.\" What are signs that you're burnt out versus just working a lot and tired?\n\nAdam Grenier (01:05:37):\nThe one that I see the most is adaptability goes down really fast. And this is more me noticing I've managed a lot of people and coached a lot of people",

I don't know.\" What are signs that you're burnt out versus just working a lot and tired?\n\nAdam Grenier (01:05:37):\nThe one that I see the most is adaptability goes down really fast. And this is more me noticing I've managed a lot of people and coached a lot of people, so when I see that from people that I'm working with, I usually immediately bring up, I'm like, \"Look, your openness to change in the business, or trying new things, or going back and trying things that maybe we tried before and didn't work has shifted from, 'Oh, here are the flags that we should be aware of, but let's give it a shot' to 'Why are we wasting our time? Let's not do this.'\"\n\nAdam Grenier (01:06:12):\nThis energy around, let's just do the thing we're supposed to do. And I think that's maybe specifically applicable to our environment, to high growth and marketing and product where it's just, that's just a key ingredient to doing this job well, is adaptability and flexibility and exploration. And if you're losing that, it's probably not because you've gotten bad at it, right? It's probably because you're just over it, right? Where you're like, \"I just don't want to deal with the BS around this. I want to go do the thing that makes my job easier.\"\n\nAdam Grenier (01:06:46):\nWhich again, most of the people that have chosen this career path want their jobs to be harder, because it's more fun, it's more interesting, it's more rewarding. And so when you're looking for ways to minimize the challenge or the opportunity, I think that's a pretty good signal that they may be more burnt out than just exhaustion. Because if anything, I see the opposite for people that are exhausted, where they get re-motivated by new stuff, by opportunities to go do something different and that kind of stuff.\n\nLenny (01:07:15):\nWow. Really good insight. Second to last question, I know you have to run, where are you on this journey today and then just what's next for Adam Grenier?\n\nAdam Grenier (01:07:24):\nYeah, thank you. Good question. I'm constantly optimizing this matrix of what am I good at versus what do I love doing? And so what I've found is that I really love entrepreneurs and working really closely with entrepreneurs and helping them figure out all of these funky things that I've been able to see over the last 20 years and maneuver. And I've worked at a lot of places and so I'm really good at context changing and helping connect the dots for people.\n\nAdam Grenier (01:07:52):\nAnd so a couple ways I've found to be able to do that is advising companies, so working with founders and growth leaders and things like that and investing. And so I'm actually right now, I've been investing now for six, seven years. I've recently joined Andreessen's Scout fund, so I'm doing a bit more volume now. But I would say if I had to make a bet right now, I think a full-time or closer to full-time investing world is what I'd like to lean more towards. But I'm very much a let's just open up opportunities, and once the right one is in front of me, I'm going to tackle it.\n\nAdam Grenier (01:08:23):\nAnd so who knows, I may go back full time somewhere or whatnot. But right now the advising, investing, coaching kind of hybrid is the term, I think it was Behzod at Reforge used, was me as a service is my current world. But I'd be shocked if I eventually don't gravitate towards some kind of foundation, because I thrive when I've got a little bit of an anchor.\n\nLenny (01:08:46):\nAmazing. A mass, me as a service.\n\nAdam Grenier (01:08:49):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:08:49):\nOkay. For folks that may want to reach out to you about taking your money in their startup, or asking whatever questions, maybe advising questions, where can folks reach you and learn more?\n\nAdam Grenier (01:09:00):\nJust Twitter, AKGrenier and LinkedIn as well, it's AKGrier. So, look me up, connect. I'm always open to connecting and chatting with people and I just love digging into problems. So, happy to abide.\n\nLenny (01:09:13):\nAmazing. Adam, this was such an action packed chat, so many levels and layers. I can't wait for folks to listen to this. Thank you so much for joining me and being here.\n\nAdam Grenier (01:09:21):\nYeah, thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (01:09:22):\nMy pleasure. Thanks man.\n\nAdam Grenier (01:09:24):\nGood stuff. Take care.\n\nLenny (01:09:26):\nThank you so much for listening.

And I was like yeah, the reason that falls down is the algorithms don't understand long term effects often, nor do they understand how people might respond to it, nor do they understand your intent for the product, and I think it's really important for product managers to play that role. That is our job. When you are working on algorithmic heavy products, your job is figuring out what the algorithm should be responsible for, what people are responsible for, and the framework for making decisions.\n\nLenny:\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Adriel Fredrick. Adriel is a VP product at Reddit where he focuses on incubating and scaling new products within Reddit. Before that, he was director of product at Lyft where he led the marketplace teams and the pricing teams over the course of five years, and before that, he was an early PM at Facebook where he spent four years leading the user acquisition team. Adriel is one of these incredible product leaders who's way too under the radar because he doesn't spend all day on Twitter and instead is executing and building great products. One of the goals of this podcast is to highlight incredible product leaders who you may not be aware of. And Adriel is a great example.\n\nLenny:\nIn our chat we talk about the origins of growth hacking, how to get better as a product leader, ways to increase diversity at your company, what it was like to work on Facebook's growth team early on, the future of AI and a lot more. It was such a joy chatting with Adriel and I am really excited to share this episode with you. With that, I bring you Adriel Frederick.\n\nLenny:\nThis episode is brought to you by Linear. Let's be honest, the issue tracker that you're using today isn't very helpful. Why is it that it always seems to be working against you instead of working for you?

How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?\n\nAshley:\nAt least 40%.\n\nLenny:\nAnd how many of them screw that up and what happens when they do?\n\nAshley:\nWell based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common considering customer files are chop full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.\n\nLenny:\nI am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.\n\nAshley:\nTotally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zoro are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.\n\nLenny:\nIf you'd like to learn more, get started, check out Flatfile at flat file.com/lenny.\n\nLenny:\nAdriel, welcome to the podcast.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nIt's good to be here, Lenny. Thanks for having me, man.\n\nLenny:\nIt's absolutely my pleasure. I actually found out about you through a guy named Jules Walter who we both know.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nYeah.\n\nLenny:\nHe's a PM at YouTube and I actually asked him, who should I have on this podcast that is maybe a little bit under the radar that is just amazing and immediately he suggested you. And so I'm really excited to be chatting.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nMan, that is hype praise coming from Jules. Jules is my boy. I love him. He's such a great guy. Awesome product manager and dedicated to the craft that I just like being in his presence.\n\nLenny:\nYeah, and we're going to get him on this podcast at some point. He's busy with some kind of secretive project that we can't talk about. He's scheduled, I could talk about Jules all day, but he actually has the 10th most popular guest post on my newsletter still. How about that?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nWow. Yep, he's awesome.\n\nLenny:\nAnyway, enough about Jules. So to give listeners a little bit of context on yourself, can you just give us a 55 second overview of all of the wonderful things that you've done in your career?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nOoh, we'll do real fast. So big highlight about me is I'm originally from Trinidad and Tobago, an island in the Caribbean.

    "content": "bit of context on yourself, can you just give us a 55 second overview of all of the wonderful things that you've done in your career?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nOoh, we'll do real fast. So big highlight about me is I'm originally from Trinidad and Tobago, an island in the Caribbean. Came to the US for college, double E, got seduced by consulting and did that for a couple years, worked in oil and gas, electric power, heavy industries, loved that stuff, but also liked writing code on the weekends for fun. So I thought I should move into tech and I did. Worked at Intuit and helped develop their first iPhone app, which was a thing back in the day. Worked at a startup growth team at Facebook for four years working on user acquisition, which was really fun and a good kind of strong formative experience. I had. Quick stint in biotech and then worked on marketplace at Lyft. So rider pricing, realtime driver incentives, matching rider with drivers, and then a lot of the operational tools that we use to manage our marketplace. And so that's a bit of my journey in maybe 45 seconds.\n\nLenny:\nThat was great. I don't have a timer for these, but that sounded right. So we're going to talk about a lot of the things that you've learned along the way at all those places. Can you also share what you do now?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAwesome. Yes. So I'm the Vice President of Product Management for Reddit X, which sounds like we're out launching balloons into space, but that's not exactly what we're doing. We're more of a team at Reddit that's thinking about the evolving the modes of interaction with Reddit. So content, temporality, the audience that you're talking to, if you think about it, Reddit is primarily about asynchronous conversations between anonymous strangers about shared interests. Sometimes other people find answers to their questions on Reddit, but we're looking into and on the X team, evolving that to look at problems like helping people communicate fast during easier about shared interests, perhaps changing who they're having conversations with. Maybe it's about something other than a shared interest or maybe they have something else in common that brings them together. Maybe bringing video, audio, and other media into being a part of the product and playing with permanence and things like that.\n\nLenny:\nWhoa, I felt like you were going to go into a metaverse direction. Is there metaverse angles to this?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nNot really. I think we look at that as a potential technology, but our primary focus is a lot more on, I see modes of interaction and platforms that are a lot more at scale today.\n\nLenny:\nGot it. Is there anything coming out in the near future we should be looking forward to? I imagine you can't talk about too much of what you're actually working on more concretely.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nI think there's a few things that we've done recently that have been fun. We have an avatar marketplace that we've been working on recently where creators have been able to make art, put it up for sale on Reddit and make that available for other folks to buy and use. And that's been performing amazingly well. The underlying technology behind it is NFTs and we thought that technology was really important to use because it gives a creator a public way of acknowledging their rights to a piece of content. And so they have some form of IP protection, especially in a marketplace where you're doing something like selling digital art, we felt like that was incredibly important. I think the technology behind NFTs has been used for some really nefarious things, but I think we're still in the infancy of using these technologies appropriately. There's a lot of terrible use and a lot of uses that are wastes, but I think there's some gems in there and we're hoping to find some of those.\n\nLenny:\nSweet. I will avoid getting pulled into a web3 rabbit hole here, but that is very cool. Something I wasn't planning to ask about, but I'm curious because I was just talking to some other guest about this topic is the idea of these kind of R and D ish teams at larger companies and companies that have been around for a while. I know you're relatively new there and that's kind of maybe a new thing, but I'm curious, is there anything you've learned about how to set up teams like this and investments like this, these kind of long term horizon bets R and D teams?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nYeah, I think it's really good coming to this from being on the other side of it. If you think about where I've been, I've been on growth and on marketplace, which is as far as you get from seeing where on the new stuff kind of team and what I've seen happen a lot is organ rejection, that this thing looks so different to the rest of the body and the rest of the organization that you get some form of rejection of the ideas entirely. So I think what I've learned is a few things.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nFirst is the rest of the company needs to see what you're doing as being core and critical to the mission. It can't seem like these guys are just playing off in a corner on something that isn't related to what we are doing every day. Because I think that leads to some of the resentment because you can imagine any team internally is fighting for resources and they look at this group as having resources that they can't get. They're like, Oh we got to get rid of that because they're not helping us do what we are here to do. So you have to be part of the core mission, otherwise you're going to have problems culturally with that. So I think that's one thing.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nThe second is it has to be everyone's success. So if you end up doing something on one of these R and D teams, it shouldn't just be the R and D team that wins. Everyone should feel like they win. And that is kind of relates to that first goal I was talking about",

So if you end up doing something on one of these R and D teams, it shouldn't just be the R and D team that wins. Everyone should feel like they win. And that is kind of relates to that first goal I was talking about. I think the third is you have to set up the work that these teams are doing such that people don't believe all innovation is going to happen on that team. It can like, okay, we're just stuck with the operational stuff and they're getting to have all the fun. Other teams are still going to innovate, but maybe we're taking on something that other teams don't have capacity for, that the organization needs and it's part of the core mission. And so I think that's been a lot of what I think about when working on and setting up these teams is to make sure that we are part of the organization and everyone wants to hug us as being, yes, you are one of us not, you kind of need to go off in your little corner and behave.\n\nLenny:\nAmazing. That is really helpful. So just to kind of recap, you want it to feel like it's core and critical to the company. You want it to feel like it's everyone's success. It's not just, oh, Adriel over there is doing great, but we're stuck with these terrible hard problems. And then this idea of not all innovation's going to be just coming from that. We can all innovate but they're just working on this one specific innovation.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nYeah.\n\nLenny:\nAwesome. Okay, great. Another question I definitely wanted to ask you. So you said you were born in Trinidad and Tobago, not something that you hear very often in tech. I'm curious your background and your journey to what you do now, how does that impact the way you lead, the way you build product, the way you just think about your career broadly?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nYeah, it's not something that I really think about consciously, but it affects me every day and it's tough not to see it in retrospect. I was the first Black product manager at Facebook.\n\nLenny:\nOh wow.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAnd so it's tough for me to not see that having some effect on what was built or how things were built or on me. So it's pretty meaningful. But I think one of the ways to see how it effects things is actually just to understand a little bit about Trinidad. It's kind of its own little unique animal. So Trinidad is an island in the southern Caribbean all the way up bottom next to Venezuela. It's a really diverse place. So ethnically it's 35% Indian, like from East India, 35% African, 25% mixed, and that last 5% is everything under the sun. European, Chinese, Arab, et cetera.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAnd then for religions it's about 60% Christian, but then that's a lot of different forms of Christianity in that 60%, 20% Hindu, 7% Islam. The media diet is a mix of British and American TV. You have a really broad range of incomes, but then schools are a melting pot, so you don't have as much of the kind of class and income segregation with schools that you get in most of the west. And so when you have that kind of a melting pot of ethnicities, religions, media consumption and kind of socioeconomic status in one place, you learn a lot of them because in school you're mixing up with everyone. One of the jokes we have is Trinidad probably has the most public holidays of any country because you have to celebrate everyone's holidays from Diwali for Hindus, Eid al-Fitr, to Christmas, I have friends who were fasting for Ramadan. I know a lot of the names of Hindu gods and I always love shocking my coworkers with my knowledge of this stuff. So that gives me this really different perspective that shows up at work.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nSo I'll give you an example. Something I've noticed in almost everybody I worked with in tech, as we work on mobile devices, people make an assumption that one phone number plus one device tied to one person. And growing up in Trinidad, I just knew that wasn't true. Someone who is using a prepaid phone could have their number change all the time, so that one person could have multiple phone numbers just because they were using prepaid. You have phones for two sim cards, that was pretty common. And a phone is and definitely was a really expensive digital device. It's a computer. So it was often shared and people couldn't just have one for themselves.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nSo when I was working on user acquisition and designing registration for Facebook, that knowledge was incorporated into the design of the product in ways that I think other companies not caught onto yet. And I know for a fact that a lot of that thinking that went into designing how you think about a phone number and a device and it's use among one, it's how to say pairing with an individual, has been helpful for Facebook's growth back then and even after I left, I know that's still been providing benefit. So that's a simple example of how just being in that environment and soaking up information could help product design in a way that I think wouldn't have happened if I and others like me weren't there.\n\nLenny:\nYou said you were the first Black PM at Facebook. I didn't realize that. How many PMs were there at that point when you joined?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nOh man. I remember we all fit into this conference room called Canada and that was probably my second week. It was probably about maybe 30 of us in there.\n\nLenny:\nWow. Yeah. Is there anything that you learned",

It was probably about maybe 30 of us in there.\n\nLenny:\nWow. Yeah. Is there anything that you learned from that experience about just how to help with diversity at a company? Did Facebook do this well? Have you seen other companies do this better? Is there something you could share there for folks that are trying to work on this?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nMan, that's a tricky one. So there's two parts of that, what was that like for me? I think it went quickly from being a little bit of imposter syndrome, like that day when I was sitting in that group was like, Dude, I'm one of 30 people working on Facebook. What am I doing? I'll belong in this group. This is crazy. And then I recognized after talking to a lot of the other PMs and the engineers, it's like no, no, no, they want me for what I know from my perspective because they're really trying to grow this product globally. And being this guy from Trinidad working on growth with the perspectives I just mentioned was appreciated. I think I was lucky enough to be on the growth team and having leaders on that team really valued diversity. I think about some of the teams I was on and they were awesome. I joke about them sometimes.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nI remember being on a team where I was a Black Trinidadian product manager with a female Israeli engineering manager, a female Brazilian tech lead, then the rest of the engineering and design team was from all over the world. We had Russians, Chinese, some folks from Slavic countries and it made designing products fun because a lot of times when you're building a product and you want to think and get into your head of your customer, you have to go out and talk because you don't necessarily get them really well. Man, we didn't need to on that team. We would just argue with each other. We would think about how our friends would use it, how our cousins would use it, and we are covering a broad swath of the world when we were arguing about how to design a product. But I think the original leadership of the growth team, I think starting with Chima but then followed up with Javi.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\n[inaudible 00:16:51] that and kept bringing in that diversity of, again, ethnicities, religions, cultures from all over the world so that you could actually build a product that way. And it just makes you so efficient because an argument that might take two weeks to resolve because you have to go recruit a panel of users and talk to them and figure out what's going on. We kind of knock out in 15 minutes just throwing it back and forth with each other. And I can't stress how much that's important for building products that you want people across the world to use. You got to have your teams look like the world, it just makes you so much faster. It's not perfect. You still have to go out and talk to folks because we still have our own kind of monocultures that form that we need to get out of. But it helps a lot.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nTo your second point about diversity and how to foster it, man, from the beginning of my career at McKinsey to today at Reddit, I've been in rooms where everyone's asking the same questions about how to fix it and here's what I've seen work. When you recognize that you get business value from it, then it all of a sudden becomes something that you look out for and you take care of. That's it. And there's definitely a lot more to it, but I think when it goes from frankly something people feel they need to do to be PC or for cultural reasons or because they're getting social pressure to do it to something that you really recognize concretely, no, I get value from this and you are willing to take the other steps to have a culture at your company that utilizes it, then it becomes easy because when you bring folks in from diverse backgrounds, they retain and that's always the number one step to growth as you will know.\n\nLenny:\nRetention.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nYou have to retain them, you have to retain diverse talent. And so you have to have an environment that values it, cares about it and uses it and rewards it because it's part of the core system of the company. Then once you have that working, it becomes a lot easier to recruit because people see you valuing it and bringing it in and wanting it. And it's not just lip service that you're paying. That's been what I've seen to be true in all the conversations I've had on the topic.\n\nLenny:\nThat first piece is interesting that it answers the second piece, which is the point you made about how having a large diverse global group of employees early on, especially for a company that's trying to go global and international is so powerful, you just save all this time. You don't have to necessarily interview people that you don't already have.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nYeah, there's something that feels like the approach to not doing it that way feels colonial. It almost feels like we're a group of people sitting down in this tower in this country, in this relatively sterile environment and don't worry, we know exactly what you need and these are the parts of the world. It just doesn't work well. So doesn't feel right to me also.\n\nLenny:\nYeah. Awesome. Thanks for sharing all that, that was really helpful. There's another topic I definitely wanted to spend a little time on, which is this interesting trend that I noticed when",

There's another topic I definitely wanted to spend a little time on, which is this interesting trend that I noticed when I was looking at your LinkedIn and your background. You worked at Facebook, Lyft, Reddit, and interestingly, they're all very in the news full of controversy type places. People like to tear them down and show all the reasons that they're doing bad things to the world. And I imagine as a PM that's just a challenging place to be and the fact that you've been at three different places. I imagine you've learned some stuff about how to operate as a product leader at companies full of chaos and fires and bad PR and things like that. So is there anything to share about what you've learned there?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nI think the biggest thing is that as a PM you are a leader. You have to provide a buffering or damping effect on the team, and that goes two weeks. Sometimes we're doing stuff that everybody thought was amazing, this is the best thing we've ever seen, and you kind of got to bring people back down to earth and go, Look, that was cool, but we got a lot more stuff to do. We are really not there on providing the value that we want to provide to people in the real world, so slow your role and recognize that there's a lot more to do. And then when it's terrible and the press is telling you that you're the worst thing to ever happen in the world, you kind of have to also go back and say, Guys, slow down. We're not anywhere near as bad as what they think you see and know what we're doing and they're going to misunderstand us sometimes. And so pull your team up at this point in time and keep charging forward with the mission.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nI think some controversy is necessary and so I may be at a different point on that one. I don't think you're going to have any meaningful influence on the world without changing some pattern of behavior. And if you're changing a pattern of behavior, there's somebody who's invested in that pattern of behavior and that's going to create some conflict. The most fun news stories to read involve conflict, so that's always going to make for a great story and put you in the press. For Facebook, it was traditional media and other social networks were one side of the fight and then Facebook was the other side of the fight and then it became other tech companies now and that always makes for a great story. With Lyft it was taxis and unions, and so you have to recognize that you're always going to have some bit of a challenge.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nNow, the really hard part about dealing with this is understanding what criticism is valid and how much of it is just because the source of power is being changed. So I'll give you an example. Let's say with Lyft, rich medallion owners in New York, I had no sympathy for them when they were complaining about trying to ban Lyft because when I was in New York City putting my hand out to get a cab, they were tried right by my Black ass. So I'm sorry, I'm like, I do not feel that much empathy for them, but I think there were really legitimate complaints about the structure of driver pay that were coming up and that were behind I think some of the complaints and some of the big stories in the press and some of the big kind of legal action that was taken. Paying for pickup time when a driver's on their way to pick you up or when they drive somebody far out of town and they have a dead head to come back into a place where they can work, that's real.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nThat's a real problem that I think we got called out for that we weren't paying enough attention to and it got us off our ass to go fix it. I don't think we've, and I say we, but I'm not there, I don't think the problem has been fully solved, but I think as a PM listening to this, you kind of have to find the truth behind it and try to find a way to work on that and not get too lost in responding to the specific criticism. And so to walk this line between kind of going, yeah, some of this controversy is just part of the game, versus like, nah, this is really valid. Dude, to figure out where that is, you got to do what is so cliche, but you got to stay close to your users. And so to give you an example of how I did that, when a lot of the complaints were happening about driving on Lyft, I drove, I would just pick up the car and I would get out and I'd go drive and I'm like, let me me go feel this for myself. Let me go see what these guys are talking about.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nBut I can give you a story about Rick. I still remember this drive I did with Rick in Berkeley. So I'm at home, I just get in the car, I turn on the app, it's time to go driving. I get up ping 15 minutes away and I'm thinking do this, I go do this right now, this guy might cancel on me, I'm not really getting paid for this, but maybe the ride is worth it. So I drive on over, I'm dodging traffic, pedestrians, drunk college kids, stop signs, I make my way over to Rick, he's coming out Chez Panisse, and he's about 80 years old, jumps in the car and then I pushed the button to figure out the destination and it says the ETA to the destination is two minutes.

So I was like, \"Hey Rick, you get this right? What's going on?\"He's like, \"Hey, I had a little bit too much to drink. I'm worried about breaking my hip, so that's why I called a ride.\" And so I went from wanting to curse Rick out for making me drive 15 minutes to come pick him up to feeling like, all right, no, no, no, there's real value I'm providing you in driving him just two minutes. But I recognized that wasn't embedded in the structure of paying. Rick would've been happy to pee for my 15 minutes to come pick him up, but we weren't one, giving drivers compensation for that, nor were we finding a way to pass that through into pricing for Rick. It's a much more difficult problem than it seems from that simple example. But it clued me into why drivers were complaining. So then I went, got it. I understand what we need to do. So when there were all the PR was going on about AB5 and prop 22, I was out driving and I was out sitting with the team trying to figure out how we're going to design our product that helps pay a driver for this.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nIt still keeps prices reasonable for users, doesn't create bad incentives where you end up with riders not getting picked up when they really need a ride because I didn't want Rick to break his hip. He still needs a price that makes him feel like it's okay for him to take that ride, and finding a way to balance this out is actually more complex than you might think. And that's what I stayed focused on whether prop 22 passed or not, I was ready for either side with a solution that was going to work for rider and drivers. That was the job. And so I think for PMs it was so easy to get sucked into the press and it's like, Yo, plan the work, work the plan, go back to your job. That's what you're supposed to do. Solve for customers in the middle of this. And then you figure out how to communicate it well.\n\nLenny:\nWhat I love about that strategy is it also helps you see that it's not everybody that is worried about something. I think of Airbnb, like all hosts are pissed off about this one feature, there's going to be a revolt. And then to your point, you talk to some, like nobody even knows about it. Nobody cares. Everyone's fine.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nYeah.\n\nLenny:\nAnd so this, there's so many benefits to what you're talking about doing, which is talking to customers, not just paying attention to the loud voices.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAbsolutely. I also have empathy for reporters too. The story that with the headline, some Airbnb hosts are annoyed by the-\n\nLenny:\nRight.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nI mean, come on, this is not a great headline. I recognize that they have a job to do and sometimes they hold people accountable and sometimes they're getting people to read a story that maybe has a bit of hyperbole in it. And so they have to do their job and I have to do mine too.\n\nLenny:\nYep. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Tenfold and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage.

It was really a pricing algorithm change, it was something behind the scenes that nobody would really see, but this was a fairly big initiative that we worked on. We had experts in revenue management to work like PhDs and the people who wrote the textbook on the subject helping advise us on this. We build this model, you launch it and you're expecting this big change. And it goes poof, just does a little bit. And then we work at it and we work at it and we work at it and eventually we get it to be good and it works really well in three cities. We start rolling it out to more cities and it's a pain in the butt to roll it out to more cities because it's super complex.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAnd eventually we get it rolled out to maybe a hundred cities and then someone says, \"All right",

We start rolling it out to more cities and it's a pain in the butt to roll it out to more cities because it's super complex.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAnd eventually we get it rolled out to maybe a hundred cities and then someone says, \"All right, cool, I want to change prices.\" And oh, we struggled for months to implement price changes and man, the sentiment around this product was just rough for a while. And I remember being on our walk after a particularly bad week of this and trying to figure out what I was going to do about this thing. Do we stay the course? After a while, the answer was kind of simple even though it was emotionally difficult. And the answer was like, Yo, we got to rebuild it. There was no answer where we couldn't have a product like this. We needed some ability to be able to influence prices so that we could actually run an effective marketplace. The current solution didn't work. It wasn't as operationally flexible as we needed it to be because we didn't consider that requirement when we were building it and we got caught up in the kind of algorithmic complexity and sweet sauce of it.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAnd so I recognized that we just needed to own up to it, tell everyone we didn't get it right and we needed to come at it in a different approach that was actually more flexible operationally. And we did. I think the big learning, at least in that business was you have to think about operational requirements and operational control as a first order requirement. And I think when a lot of us were building product at a lot of the other consumer internet companies, you didn't have to think about operational control. You gave the algorithms an objective, you feed them some data, you let it run, you observe it and make sure it's doing nothing crazy and you tweak it, but you didn't need to have day to day operational and strategic control over the product and we just needed to snap our brains into being able to put people in the loop with the algorithm.\n\nLenny:\nFor folks that haven't worked at a company with this kind of on the ground ops team, can you just unpack what that is? Like operational control, what does that actually mean in practical terms?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nOkay, so I'll give you an example. So back in the days Lyft is in 300 cities, probably roughly across the US, and in every single one of those cities you don't have exactly the same pricing. It's a little bit different. And so sometimes you might need to make a change seasonally because traffic gets worse or because fuel prices were different or because there's a new tax or because your competitor did something that you need to respond to and your algorithm cannot see this. It has zero visibility into this. And so you need a person in the loop to not only give that visibility but also to make a decision about how you respond. Because I think also, let's say you're in Chicago and there is a snowstorm and you need to change the way, let's say you need to update pricing so that it handles the increases in driver pay that you need to create to get people out during a snowstorm. You don't know exactly how you want to respond, every snow storm's different and a person has to make that judgment call and provide the right information to the product to be able to get to utilize it. Now algorithms were handing a lot of that and they could generally respond, but to be a lot more precise and needed a person to help handle that, to make that call.\n\nLenny:\nGot it. Cool. Thanks for sharing that. So you're making this point about when you're at a company that has a big operations component and obviously the core central product team, you were sharing some learnings about what you've learned to work in that environment. So yeah, I just wanted to come back to that.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nFor sure. For sure.\n\nLenny:\nSo the main thing you said is just ops as a first order component when you're designing the software. Is that the big learning?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nI think it's not just treating ops as the kind of first order requirement. The bigger picture for me was when I look across my career is the algorithms need people to help make judgment calls. And so I saw it really, I got a heavy lesson in it at Lyft, but when I look back I recognized it was there at Facebook too. It just wasn't in my domain. There is always a judgment call that has to be made between how often are there going to be ads versus how often are we going to show organic stories from your friends and family? How often are we going to show content that you might be interested in that's not quite in that group? How often might be want to show you things that help you find your friends or help other people find their friends? And that is a judgment call that varies for different markets and different situations and there may be algorithms behind the scene that are making that call for every single person in real time, but there still have to be people applying some strategic judgment to that.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAnd I wasn't in the position of needing to do that at Facebook, but once I saw how much I needed to do it at Lyft and I kind of looked back at history, I saw that it was there too. But I think there are too many people who don't see this and believe that there's an algorithmic solution to everything. I think as a product manager and especially product managers working on systems that are heavy on machine learning or operations research and optimization, to think about where you want a person to make a decision and where you want the machine to be off to the races and to think about",

But I think there are too many people who don't see this and believe that there's an algorithmic solution to everything. I think as a product manager and especially product managers working on systems that are heavy on machine learning or operations research and optimization, to think about where you want a person to make a decision and where you want the machine to be off to the races and to think about that as a product design problem because there actually is actually a computer interface that you have to think about there. You need information about what's going on, let's say at Lyft, what's going on with my market? How long does it take for somebody to get picked up? How expensive am I versus the competition? What are my goals in this market and how am I performing today with that? Give somebody information, but also give them the tools to execute the right decisions without creating trouble. And that's like a product design problem, that's a first order product design problem like anything else that you have to think about. And I'm not privy to it, but I would guarantee that there are people thinking about those same kinds of problems at other companies.\n\nLenny:\nThat reminds me, I was just listening to Zuck on Joe Rogan and he made this point that when you look at a post, you can add a little emoji reaction and you can have a little angry emoji reaction. And he made the call that we're not going to use the angry emoji reaction in our algorithm in any way, we're just going to ignore that because naturally you'd be like, okay, people are angry, that's interesting. Let's show that because it's interesting to people. But he specifically wants to avoid anger and facilitating anger probably because a lot of the feedback that they've gotten.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nExactly. And I think they're probably, I'd call them techno utopians who would say feed all data to the algorithm, give it an objective and it will do the right thing. And I was like, yeah, the reason that falls down is the algorithms don't understand long term effects often, nor do they understand how people might respond to it, nor do they understand your intent for the product. And I think it's really important for product managers to play that role. That is our job. When you are working on algorithmic heavy products, your job is figuring out what the algorithm should be responsible for, what people are responsible for and the framework for making decisions.\n\nLenny:\nIs there an example that comes to mind where you did that or didn't do that well or someone on your team should have? Just something to make it a little more concrete even.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nLet's assume that you are a person working on pricing and you say like, great, I have an objective that is I would like to win market share in a region. And you left that to an algorithm to say I need you to optimize prices such that you maximize market share, but what would the algorithm do? Drop your prices to the floor. All the way to the floor, and then you don't make any money. Okay great. So then you say, okay, what's the next step of that? Let's give it a constraint. Let's set some target that we might want to have for how little profit that you might be willing to take. Okay, go do it now.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nWhat if the guy on the other side is doing the exact same thing? Both of you will hit your constraints and then the game will stop. Okay great. So now it then flips to, oh we have to choose where we want to win. And so I think one of the things we did that I'm particularly proud of is building products that help people see and understand that game a little bit more and decide where they want to. I think the first few pieces of that are not shockers, but that conclusion at the end where you get to, oh wait, I need to create a tool that gives people information to then decide how to play this game is actually what's critical.\n\nLenny:\nInteresting. So kind of what I'm hearing is a lot of the work is giving humans more information versus giving machine learning algorithms more information and there's a lot more leverage potentially there, giving humans more ways to tweak and dial.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nLet me refine that a little bit more. It's more about giving people the information that they can use for decisions that they alone are good at and giving machines the power to amplify a person's intent. So one of the ways I like to think about it is all software in any form including ML, is just a tool like a screwdriver and you could try to put a flat head into a Phillips and maybe it'll work a little bit but it's better to use a Phillips screwdriver. And we're tool designers generally and especially in part development function, you figure out how much do I put into the tool and how much do I leave it up to the person and I give the person the ability to choose what they want to do. I give them a screwdriver, a flathead, a Phillips, a torques and you let them decide how they want to use the tool for the application at hand.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAnd so going from that analogy to concretely with ML you say look, machine learning's going to be amazing at optimizing for a given objective, but it's not going to understand the constraints or strategic choices I need to make. The constraints and strategic choices that we need in the external world are always going to have to be decided by a person. You make that incredibly easy for people to do and intuitive for them to do and then you go that algorithm can then amplify their effect by making decisions on hundreds of thousands, potentially millions of individual decisions to take that person's intent and amplify it given all the information that they can learn in that single context. So I think about it as designing an interface and",

So I think about it as designing an interface and make it an extension of yourself rather than a black box on its own that you just need more information to. Is that helpful?\n\nLenny:\nYeah, it makes me think about a neural link and what Elon's trying to do, I don't know if this is how he thinks about it, but the [inaudible 00:39:56] guy described it as Elon's worried that AI will take over at some point and so he wants to build a tool that connects straights our brain that can access the power of AI to kind of have a chance against just a rogue computer in the future.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nEven then you've got to make sure the person is still in control. I hear that thought and I go, okay, you build the interface but then who's in control? Is the person still in control or did they become a slave to the machine and you just made a better interface to make them a slave?\n\nLenny:\nOh shit, we're in trouble.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nI am not yet as worried about these visions of them taking over. Thus far and maybe I haven't fathomed what they can do, they still seem like tools that need our guidance to be useful. Even the most amazing, we've been seeing the image generation and I've seen the cutting edge like text generation stuff. They can fool you into believing that they're like near human capability, but there is a lack of decision making and judgment that I see coming out of them. I see them as being again, extensions and useful like text generation algorithms. A lot of them can't write a paper for you and that's what I think people are scared of because it still requires your judgment to decide. Now when you decide what the salient topics are in something you've read, let's say you're doing a book report, you've decided what the topics are, it can help you write the paper faster for sure, but it can't write the paper for you. It can't choose the topics that your background and history and interest find useful or compelling to tease out.\n\nLenny:\nThis isn't where I was expecting our conversation to go, but I'll add another thought here because it's interesting, the way I think about it is there's nothing magical about our brain and so if that's true, why isn't there a world where we could just completely simulate it? Sam Harris talks about this a lot that it feels like once you get close then it could just accelerate so quickly beyond human potential. It'll start from 20% as good as a human to 40, 50, 60 and then it goes to a million times better. It can move so fast beyond us very quickly. So I think that's where a lot of the, not that I'm afraid of this, but I feel like that's where a lot of fear comes from. It could just dolly coming out and co-pilot just like holy shit.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nYeah, our brains are good with linear thinking, not exponential. So I've heard that argument that like, yes, this is increasing exponentially and you can't fathom it. I'm like, yes, that is definitely potentially true. Completely see that possibility and recognize that I have that cognitive defect in being able to understand it and even if it's a remote possibility, we should be paying attention to it. So I'm all for paying attention to it given the, let's just say the high cost of a low probability outcome is still a high cost and so it's still worth paying attention to.\n\nLenny:\nYep. Okay, good tangent, I wanted to chat about your learnings at Facebook. We've been chatting about all these other places and especially about growth, just stuff you've learned about growth and growth hacking and I was thinking about this interesting world that Facebook is in slash Meta where on the one hand when they started, and I'm talking about growth hacking, like Facebook did a lot of growth hacks, emailed all of Harvard, he had all these interesting dating thing happening and got a lot of controversy and it was all these interesting tactics to start Facebook, but now people use Facebook to growth hack and grow like Zenga famously, a few other places. So all that to say, I'm curious, what have you learned about growth slash growth hacking from your time at Facebook and other places?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nI think growth hacking as traditionally assigned, finding those small changes you can make to a product to give you outsized impact, that is absolutely valuable. Where I've seen people get lost is they assume that if you do that alone, it will work. You can grow your way into something successful if you just find those few hacks and patch them together. And there's something about that that I find disrespectful to the people using the product. It's like you assume that they have no intelligence and they won't catch on to what you're doing eventually. The old saying fool me once, fool me twice, it kind of applies. So if you don't have a product that's providing real fundamental value to people, you can be a one hit wonder and have a flash in the pan and growth hack your way into something that might last for a few months but people will catch on it and then it'll disappear.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nSo I think that stuff is helpful, especially early on to get your initial traction. But you got to have something people and want to continue using. And when I think back over the products we did that really moved the needle, they were all things that just focus on the marginal user and figured out to",

But you got to have something people and want to continue using. And when I think back over the products we did that really moved the needle, they were all things that just focus on the marginal user and figured out to make the product easier. It's easy to get seduced to thinking that there is a fast secret way to do it. And I'm like, no. The vast majority of it was just hard work and finding ways to solve the real problems. And what are those real problems? They were pretty damn simple but we just grinded on them for a long time it just stayed on it. One, make it easy to find the product. Number two, make it easy to get into the product. Three, stupid easy to find your friends. And then once you did that you were off the races and those were the things we were doing over and over again.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nI think another big piece of it is reminding people that there's something interesting here and building the habit of coming back to the product and it was also part of it, but we just grinded on those few things over and over again. And some of the really big wins weren't hacks, they were just paying attention to little details. I'll give you an example. I remember sitting one day thinking about how to help people find their first few friends and we would do this thing where we'd have recommendations, if you could get one or two friends, you'd be off to the races and we could find you more people that were in that same friend group. So I thought about the way the people you may know algorithm worked, I get one or two friends, they would find your mutual friends and then would help find you more of those kinds of folks.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAnd I was like, you know what that does is it spirals you down one friend group but it doesn't get you all your other friends. I remember just looking at somebody using the product and recognizing that we were only taking them down this one path. So I was like, man, how do I see all your friend groups? And so we had this idea that we came up with that would do it. I'm not going to let that one out. And it was like game changer, like absolute game changer. Especially for users helping them find those first few friends in a few different friend groups, which then meant we could get you down one group and another and just continue building out that graph just by using recommendations. Because we had a great tool for seating it and that was not easy. That was not a hack. That was hard work.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nI also remember one of my favorites is something Tom Allison did, Tom Allison I think now is responsible for the Facebook App, and when he was working on the engineering manager for one of those teams, there was a change we wanted to do to one of these algorithms and it was a bitch, it wasn't a hack and it was going to take a few months to pull off and Tom just hit it in a corner. He just let everybody know that we were really going to change the way this product worked. He had a really smart guy working on it, [inaudible 00:47:03], and they just hid off in a corner, rebuilt the product in the way it needed to be built to make it easier for us to operate it and scale it and then put it up there. I know of course they crushed it and they were incredibly modest about it, but it was not a hack. And it came from them looking at this deep problem of finding that thing that mattered and then saying, we need to make a fundamental change to make it easier to recommend friends to folks and just grinding on it.And so one of the things I recommend for people when they're thinking about growth for their product is figure out what the core actions are and then grind on them. Think about removing them, removing friction and some of them. But just keep staying at it and as you grind on it, you'll do little hacks. You got to figure out how to put the right text in the button and get it above the fold, create the right copy. All the things that we traditionally associate with growth marketing, you got to do those things. But to me that's stable stakes and just doing good product communication with your user, but then you got to think about this person who can't yet figure out your product and it's trying to take this action and making it stupid easy for them. I got a million more examples of that one, but that's the game. It's not just finding some trick to [inaudible 00:48:18] a site.\n\nLenny:\nI love that. The way I think about this that I've heard well described is just there's no silver bullets, just many lead bullets.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nYes. And a few massive cannonballs every now and then. Every now and then there's some cannonballs.\n\nLenny:\nWhat's an example of a cannonball as you think about that?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nSign up with phone numbers, which is now par for the course, that was a cannonball. Getting SMSs delivered to people all over the world. Doesn't sound glamorous, really hard to do. That was cannonball. Good friend recommendations, another big one. There's more, I'm not going to go into all of them. What I mean by cannonball here is that there was sometimes some really big fundamental changes you needed to make to the product to make these things work.\n\nLenny:\nGot it. So you think about that in terms of investment, not necessarily the impact-\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nInvestment.\n\nLenny:",

So you think about that in terms of investment, not necessarily the impact-\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nInvestment.\n\nLenny:\nImpact plus massive investment. Cool. I have so many questions along these lines. Okay, I'm going to pick a couple. One is Facebook is famous for this kind of activation milestone of getting 10 friends or seven friends, whatever it was, like there's some number friends you got to get and the good things will happen. Were you involved in that? Do you have any insight into how that came to be? Is that real?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nThat decision came before me. I saw it. I understood the data and I worked on this problem. What I thought was brilliant about that was not the metric, it was the designing it to be understood and communicated. What I think is fabulous about it is that you are talking about it now because it's memorable and it got people to take the right actions to start chasing the goal. There was literally nothing magic about the number or the date, but basically it was a way of saying like get people as many friends as possible as fast as possible. And if you said that generically to someone, they'd be like, Yeah, I kind of get it, but yeah, I'll go do that.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nWhen you create a discreet number and a discreet time and there is a concrete goal to chase and there's a number and a graph that everybody can look at and see, we are going to go make that thing go up, the organizational effect of that is galvanizing. So what I thought was brilliant about it is, and as I've heard the stories, this is all secondhand. There was a lot of debate about what the number should be, what timeframe should be, and at some point Zuck just said 10 friends, 14 days, go. And it just got people past the academic debate of like, All right, got it. As many friends as possible, the fast as possible, let's go.\n\nLenny:\nI love that. That's exactly how I've always thought about it, that it's not the number exactly, it's just a rallying cry that everyone can just get around and just go, doesn't need to be this perfect number that has incredibly correlated link to retention or anything like that. It's just like, this is good enough. It's directionally I'll just try to do this. Let's just go.\n\nLenny:\nThere are downsides of it. Some of them are really funny. I remember looking at a graph of retention versus number of friends and what actually dropped with 11 or 12 versus 10 because somewhere in code, somebody had done something with 10 friends is the limit to help improve retention. And it shut off at 11 or 12 and it came back up, but I was like, You know what, that's fine. That's completely fine. Because if we didn't get that organizational momentum, that graph would've just been lower. So I could take the kink where it drops, it's fine.\n\nLenny:\nYou also mentioned this term marginal user and I thought it'd be helpful just to unpack what you mean by that.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nFor me, it's a person who is just on the cusp of taking the action you want to take. I'll give you the concrete example. When working on registration, I would try to find a country where we had a lot of growth, but for some reason our conversion rates were terrible. So we had a lot of traffic, but conversion rates were terrible. And I was like, okay, that's the marginal user. This is the person who is just on the cusp of coming in, wants to come in as you can see by the traffic, but we can't get them in. So why? And when you go to the extreme and you find that person who's the worst, and most likely it was a person on a feature phone on edge, trying to access Facebook in a country that was far from one of our data centers. And then you go like, All right, what's wrong with this person's experience?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nLet's go check it out. And you're like, Oh, you see everything that's wrong with the product. So then it gives you your list. Okay, the language is probably wrong. We didn't get that. Are we detecting the country properly so that we can actually get their phone number formatted properly? Probably not. Oh man, it's far from the data center, so that connection's slow and they're on edge. Oh, that's terrible. And you just see and package up all those, it gives everything that's wrong and they can just start figuring out what to do with them. Something I caution people against though is don't use the data alone to figure out who the marginal user is. It'll give you a clue where they are and what might be wrong, will give you some hints. It's not going to give you the answer. You have to go watch them to find the answer.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nBecause I think in a lot of these data driven places, somebody will say, Great, just create a funnel. Figure out all this drop offs of the steps in the funnel, Look at it yourself and then figure out what might be wrong and go fix those things. But what I think happens is often there's a problem that's orthogonal to that funnel that you can't see from looking at the data. And you have to go look at the person and talk to them. I remember one example we had is was watching someone sign up up for the very first time for Facebook in India and they're about",

I remember one example we had is was watching someone sign up up for the very first time for Facebook in India and they're about to put their name in it and they ask them, So what name are you going to put in? They're like, Okay, my full legal name. All right, cool. Does anybody in the real world call you that? No. And I was like, Oh dude, we're screwed.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nIf you send out friend requests, it's not going to get accepted because nobody knows who this person is, and then the reverse, if they find you, they don't know who this is. And so it was like, Yo, you're going to look at some problem deeper in the funnel, yo, what's going on my accept rate? And then you're going to go tear I that little mini funnel and then recognize that you had a problem that happened ways back. And so when you thinking about that marginal user, you got to go out and look at them, talk to them, watch them use it, try to get into their shoes yourself as much as you can, and then make the call from there from what you do. But that data isn't going to tell you, it's going to give you the answer. I'll just tell you how bad.\n\nLenny:\nWow. I love that connects back to the same advice you gave in all these other contexts of just talked to people. Don't rely on just this aggregate data.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nNow, don't get me wrong, I've built the experimentation platform at Lyft. I'm a guy who loves data and loves using it and looking at experiments. I think it's just too easy to try to sit in your laptop, pull up a funnel or pull up some charts or look at an experiment results and think that's going to give you the clue to what to build. It's a compliment. It's not the only thing. And I watch people fall into that trap of assuming, especially when you're working at companies with lots and lots of data, you fall into the trap of thinking that you're swimming in answers because you have all this data and just need to tease it up. Just go out and talk, you'll find it faster.\n\nLenny:\nI really like this advice of when you're trying to optimize things, focus on your marginal user. And there's two parts to it that you talked about. There's the next most likely person to sign up and then there's the worst case and going to like them to see all the things that are wrong and that be your north star, make this person successful and make so many more people successful. Is that how you think about it?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nYeah, I do. So marginal user I think is the fun word to think about because you think of families, think about children, the person who's right on the cusp. But I like to go to the worst. It shows me everything that's wrong, but the marginal user thinking helps you prioritize what thing to do next. So that person, that example marginal user I was talking about, they're on a future phone with edge too. There's a lot wrong that's just going to be tough. But I might look at that experience and go, All right, let's say somebody was perfectly equipped the best phone and a great internet connection in that country. What would still be wrong? I was like, Oh, language is still wrong and the latency to their phone is actually still pretty high to our data centers, which is why it's taking a long time to sign up. I could still fix that. So that's how you can see the worst case to tell you everything, but then decide what is marginal by removing a few of the barriers that you know are difficult for you to attack and then see which ones are closer to being resolved.\n\nLenny:\nAwesome. I wanted to ask one more question about experiments at Facebook back in the day. So we talked about there's all these lead bullets or some cannonballs, maybe a silver bullet somewhere. In your experience, what percentage of experiments end up being impactful and successful?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nOkay, that's a difficult and different question. So I'd say probably 60% successful, 40% you should turn off. But within that 60%, I think there's a hidden cost to the experiment, which is that you're futzing around with something small. You could have used your time on something bigger and more meaningful, but you're futzing around with a bunch of these small ones. Some of the small things were incredibly meaningful and you needed to do them. So I think this is actually, it's almost like the same problem about, I don't know which of my marketing is best. You have to try a bunch of stuff and then figure out what was terrible. You don't know before you do it, before you do the experiment, what the impact is. But sometimes what I've seen is let's take a bunch of them as a program and let's say you have over the course of three months, you're going to experiment with 10 things.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nYou might have been able to push on two really big ones. And what I've seen is there's a laziness, and this is broadly, this is not just at Facebook, it's broader. There's a laziness that can creep in where you're just finding a lot of little things because they're easier to come up with and they're easier to design and think about. It's easier to build, it's easier to talk to your boss and say, remove the number by 0.02% and you feel good about doing those few small things. And so it creates this incremental",

It's easier to build, it's easier to talk to your boss and say, remove the number by 0.02% and you feel good about doing those few small things. And so it creates this incremental thinking where you're just trying to do a bunch of small things that just don't meaningfully add up to something big.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nI think what's healthy is having a good portfolio because basically you say like look, I'm going to have, using our analogies from before, I'm going to have some cannonballs. I'm going to work on a couple cannonballs and I'm going to have a bunch of lead bullets. And maybe it's 80% of your energies on those big cannonballs, 20% on the lead bullets, and having a constraint like that forces you to choose the fewer experiments that are actually probably the really good ones and it's not just a whole bunch of crap that you're trying out.\n\nLenny:\nAnd is that actually how you divide up those bets broadly? Is that like a rule thumb you have or is that just numbers you're putting out there?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nThose are just numbers I'm putting out there. It's always going to be a gut call based on where you are. I think depending on the stage your product is at, it should be a different set, a different bite. Very early on when you're building a product, you kind of know what the big things are. You've talked enough people, you have enough, just go build it. You should not be playing around with experiments. It might be a hundred percent cannonballs. Just go knock the big pieces out, don't worry, it'll work.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAlso, the cost of experimentation is time. So if you are experimenting on every little thing and waiting for the data to come in and then also screwing up some other part of the product because your experiment's on 50 50, it's just not worth it. Just bang the big things out. As you get more mature, the balance needs to switch in the portfolio. Probably not that many big cannonballs anymore, probably just one. And there's probably a lot of the refinements that you need to work on. And by then you have this scale that the time to experiment isn't as high and the cost of experimenting is lower. So it's fine. It's good to do with that way.\n\nLenny:\nOkay. One last question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. So you've moved from IC a while back at this point to now VP of Product at one of the most trafficked sites on the internet. And I'm curious, what skills have you grown or had to grow most as you've gotten more senior in your career?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nOrganization design and empathy.\n\nLenny:\nWhoa, I love that.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nOh dude, for a long time, and I think this is, I and many others had this idea that the people who are the smartest are the ones who rise. The people who are the most technically competent are the ones who rise. People who are the best individual contributors are the ones who rise. And somewhere along the way I had that idea disabused of me and I recognize the job's different. It's more about building a great team, creating the right incentives for the team on blocking them, guiding them, and helping them work efficiently. Those mattered way more than anything else. And I guess one of the ways I slowly recognize it is as I started going up in my career, I recognized that if I wanted to have more impact, I couldn't do everything myself. There was just more that needed to be done. And in today's world, you can't do anything meaningful by yourself.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nYou need a lot of people to do stuff with you. There's nothing meaningful that gets done by any single person, even though people like to make you think that in their hustle porn that they post online. So it may be just a step back and think about what helped me be productive in environments when I was productive and how I could do that for others because then that would just naturally help me. And so there were simple things like clear goals, helping people feel safe and understand that you got their back. Making it easy to do their jobs. But my job is to make sure the processes for you doing your work and the people who you have to interact with are just buttery smooth and everything just runs easily. And so that was lesson one. It was just designing a good organization, culture, skills, people, processes, et cetera, all necessary.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nThat's one piece. The second is empathy. Where a step of that was just like you have to have that as a PM for your user, but I think it's different to having it for a peer and another function or somebody else on one of your teams. And the hardest part of it is they say getting in somebody else's shoes. The hardest part is taking my own shoes off. Basically going, Yo, okay, I came into this, there's something I wanted, I wanted to get rid of that. Now just talk to this person and try to understand what's going on with them, what they care about for their life goals and motivations, what they're scared of, what they're excited by, how you might be able to help them. Once I was able to get out my shoes, clear my mind, try to get into their head, then I could be like, All right, cool, let's find a nice happy middle ground in the middle here. But that's something that works for both of us together.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAnd sometimes for me it was, Yo,",

I've gotten into your shoes, I need to leave you alone. Like you're good. Other times I'm ready to push. But I think once I have the empathy, I'm then able to think about what we as an organization broadly want to achieve and try to put the two shoes on at the same time and find something that works for both of us. So what's that common objective? And I think that's how I try to approach almost every conversation is, especially being a guy who looks different, talks different, comes from somewhere else, first thought they might have is and unconsciously might be like this guy isn't one of us. But then once I make it clear to them that we have the same objectives, we're about the same thing and I want to know what's going on with you so that I can help you achieve what you want to achieve. Dude, problems go away.\n\nLenny:\nOkay. I know I have to let you go and you have to get back to real work. So we've reached our very exciting lightning round, the final part of our little chat.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nDarn right.\n\nLenny:\nBasically I'm just going to ask you five quick questions, whatever comes to mind, share it and we'll go through a pretty quick.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAll right.\n\nLenny:\nSound good? Okay. What are two, three books that you recommend most to people?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nThe Prize and probably now The New Map by Daniel Yergin. They are books about the history of oil and the geopolitics of oil. It is a fascinating way to understand the world. It's like the best books I've seen to understand geopolitics and how they work and why they work. It does it through the lens of oil, which explains way more than you might think. And so this comes from the early part of my career working in energy.\n\nLenny:\nI will link that into show notes. I've not heard of that one before. What's a favorite podcast of yours other than this one?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nOh, of course, you took the easy one away. Revisionist History with Malcolm Gladwell, just gives you a different look into things. I'm also a huge car nerd, like deep into modifying and tweaking and tuning cars. So there's this esoteric one called HP Academy that I'm into, but most of your listeners will not beat to that.\n\nLenny:\nWow. Very out there and awesome. And I think there's a new season of her Revisionist History coming out soon.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nYep.\n\nLenny:\nOkay. Favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nLast night I discovered Mo on Netflix.\n\nLenny:\nMo.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAnd it's short for Mohammed. It is semi autobiographical about a Palestinian refugee living in Houston, his journey to seek asylum and live and work and date in this multicultural environment, he speaks Arabic, Spanish and English fluently. Funny as hell, but also dramatic. It is fabulous.\n\nLenny:\nAmazing. Okay. Wow, these are all very unique. I love it. In a different direction, what's a favorite interview question that you like to ask?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nThese days at work, I have to go through the standard interview questions, but when I got to play and sometimes when I feel like playing a little bit more, I'll see something like, teach me something you don't think I know. It's a really good test of what you've heard me say a lot, empathy. I heard [inaudible 01:04:58] use it once and I kept trying it to see what it was good for and it helps you understand how good somebody is at reading you, how much knowledge they have and their ability to communicate and share knowledge. So it was like it actually could test a lot of things at once and a lot of times you learn something, it's awesome.\n\nLenny:\nOkay, final question. Who else in the industry would you say that you most respect as a thought leader?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nWell look on the discipline, [inaudible 01:05:24], discipline of product management, definitely [inaudible 01:05:26]. I think just in terms of technology development, it's the team behind Radiant Nuclear.\n\nLenny:\nWhat is that?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nWhile taking a break between jobs, I'm studying climate change and energy because of my background and I just basically became convinced that nuclear is a bigger answer than we're giving a credit for. A lot of the barriers are political, not technical, but the solution they're working on I think is a technical solution to some of the political problems we have around nuclear, which seems really interesting and I am really hoping that they pull off what they're trying to do.\n\nLenny:\nWow. I love how out there all these recommendations are. These are great. Adriel, I am so appreciative of you making time for this. I'm also really appreciative to Jules for connecting us. This was amazing. You're awesome. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, and then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nAwesome. Before I jump into that, thank you for having me on here. It's just good to reflect about life and work for a little bit and hopefully",

Number one, keep listening to this podcast because if everybody keeps listening to the insights that you are teasing out, a lot of things will work well and not necessarily me. Another thing they could do to be useful to me is find somebody that's just different to you and talk to them for five minutes. That's it. I think that will come back to me eventually.\n\nLenny:\nLove these and really flattered, really appreciate it. Thank you for being here.\n\nAdriel Frederick:\nThanks for having me, Lenny, take it easy.\n\nLenny:\nThank you so much for listening.

They had this really key insight that building AI products is very different from building non-AI products.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:00:08):\nMost people tend to ignore the non-determinism. You don't know how the user might behave with your product, and you also don't know how the LLM might respond to that. The second difference is the agency control trade-off. Every time you hand over decision-making capabilities to agentic systems, you're kind of relinquishing some amount of control on your end.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):\nThis significantly changes the way you should be building product.\n\nKiriti Badam (00:00:28):\nSo we recommend building step-by-step. When you start small, it forces you to think about what is the problem that I'm going to solve. In all this advancements of the AI, one easy, slippery slope is to keep thinking about complexities of the solution and forget the problem that you're trying to solve.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:00:42):\nIt's not about being the first company to have an agent among your competitors. It's about have you built the right flywheels in place so that you can improve over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):\nWhat kind of ways of working do you see in companies that build AI products successfully?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:00:55):\nI used to work with the CEO of now Rackspace. He would have this block every day in the morning, which would say catching up with AI 4:00 to 6:00 AM. Leaders have to get back to being hands-on. You must be comfortable with the fact that your intuitions might not be right. And you probably are the dumbest person in the room and you want to learn from everyone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:13):\nWhat do you think the next year of AI is going to look like?\n\nKiriti Badam (00:01:16):\nPersistence is extremely valuable. Successful companies right now building in any new area, they are going through the pain of learning this, implementing this and understanding what works and what doesn't work. Pain is the new moat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:29):\nToday, my guests are Aishwarya Reganti and Kiriti Badam. Kiriti works on Kodex at OpenAI and has spent the last decade building AI and ML infrastructure at Google and at Kumo. Ash was an early AI researcher at Alexa and Microsoft and has published over 35 research papers. Together, they've led and supported over 50 AI product deployments across companies like Amazon, Databricks, OpenAI, Google, and both startups and large enterprises. Together, they also teach the number one rated AI course on Maven, where they teach product leaders all of the key lessons they've learned about building successful AI products. The goal of this episode is to save you and your team a lot of pain and suffering and wasted time trying to build your AI product. Whether you are already struggling to make your product work or want to avoid that struggle, this episode is for you.

They're messy. They're slow to build. They're a huge drain on your roadmap, and they're definitely not why you got into product in the first place. Lucky for you, Merge is obsessed with integrations. With a single API, B2B SaaS companies embed Merge into their product and ship 220 plus customer-facing integrations in weeks, not quarters.\n\n(00:03:14):\nThink of merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS. Companies like Mistral AI, Ramp, and Drata use Merge to connect their customers as accounting, HR, ticketing, CRM, and file storage systems to power everything from automatic onboarding to AI-ready data pipelines. Even better, Merge now supports the secure deployment of connectors to AI agents with a new product so that you can safely power AI workflows with real customer data. If your product needs customer data from dozens of systems, Merge is the fastest, safest way to get it. Book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny, and they'll send you a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Strella, the customer research platform built for the AI era. Here's the truth about user research. It's never been more important or more painful.

Ash and Kiriti, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:05:13):\nThank you, Lenny.\n\nKiriti Badam (00:05:14):\nThank you for having us. Super excited for this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:16):\nLet me set the stage for the conversation that we're going to have today. So you two have built a bunch of AI products yourself. You've gone deep with a lot of companies who have built AI products, have struggled to build AI products, build AI agents. You also teach a course on building AI products successfully and you're kind of on this mission to just reduce pain and suffering and failure that you constantly see people go through when they're building AI products. So to set a little just foundation for the conversation we're going to have, what are you seeing on the ground within companies trying to build AI products? What's going well? What's not going well?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:05:54):\nI think 2025 has been significantly different than 2024. One, the skepticism has significantly reduced. There were tons of leaders last year who probably thought this would be yet another crypto wave and kind of skeptical to get started. And a lot of the use cases that I saw last year were more of slap chat on your data. And that was calling themselves an AI product. And this year, a ton of companies are really rethinking their user experiences and their workflows and all of that and really understanding that you need to deconstruct and reconstruct your processes in order to build successful AI products. And that's the good stuff. The bad stuff is the execution is still all over the place. Think of it. This is a three-year-old field. There are no playbooks, there are no textbooks. So you really need to figure out as you go. And the AI lifecycle, both pre-deployment and post-deployment is very different as compared to a traditional software lifecycle.\n\n(00:06:57):\nAnd so a lot of old contracts and handoffs between traditional roles, like say PMs and engineers and data folks has now been broken and people are really getting adapted to this new way of working together and kind of owning the same feedback loop in a way. Because previously, I feel like PMs and engineers and all of these folks had their own feedback loops to optimize. And now you need to be probably sitting in the same room. You're probably looking at agent traces together and deciding how your product should behave. So it's a tighter form of collaboration. So companies are still kind of figuring that out. That's kind of what I see in my consulting practice this year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:37):\nSo let me follow that thread. We worked on a guest post together that came out a few months ago. And the thing that stood out to me most that stuck with me most after working on that post is this really key insight that building AI products is very different from building non-AI products. And the thing that you're big on getting across is there's two very big differences. Talk about those two differences.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:08:01):\nYes. And again, I want to make sure that we drive home the right point. There are tons of similarities of building AI systems and software systems as well, but then there are some things that kind of fundamentally change the way you build software systems versus AI systems. And one of them that most people tend to ignore is the non-determinism. You're pretty much working with a non-deterministic API as compared to traditional software. What does that mean and why does that have to affect us is in traditional software, you pretty much have a very well-mapped decision engine or workflow. Think of something like Booking.com. You have an intention that you want to make a booking in San Francisco for two nights, et cetera. The product has kind of been built so that your intention can be converted into a particular action and you kind of are clicking through a bunch of buttons, options, forms, and all of that, and you finally achieve your intention.\n\n(00:08:59):\nBut now that layer in AI products has completely been replaced by a very fluid interface, which is mostly natural language, which means the user can literally come up with a ton of ways of saying or communicating their intentions. And that kind of changes a lot of things because now you don't know how your user's going to be here. That's on the input side. And the output is also that you're working with a non-deterministic probabilistic API, which is your LLM. And LLMs are pretty sensitive to prompt phrasings and they're pretty much black boxes. So you don't even know how the output surface will look like",

So you don't even know how the output surface will look like. So you don't know how the user might behave with your product, and you also don't know how the LLM might respond to that. So you're now working with an input, output, and a process. You don't understand all the three very well. You're trying to anticipate behavior and build for it.\n\n(00:09:53):\nAnd with agentic systems, this kind of gets even harder. And that's where we talk about the second difference, which is the agency control trade-off. What we mean by that, and I'm kind of shocked so many people don't talk about this. They're extremely obsessed with building autonomous systems, agents that can do work for you. But every time you hand over decision-making capabilities or autonomy to agentic systems, you're kind of relinquishing some amount of control on your end. And when you do that, you want to make sure that your agent has gained your trust or it is reliable enough that you can allow it to make decisions. And that's where we talk about this agency controlled trade-off, which is if you give your AI agent or your AI system, whatever it is, more agency, which is the ability to make decisions, you're also losing some control and you want to make sure that the agent or the AI system has earned that ability or has built up trust over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:49):\nSo just to summarize what you're sharing here, essentially, people have been building product, software products for a long time. We're now in a world where the software you're building is one, non-deterministic, can just do things differently. As you said, you go to booking.com, you find a hotel, it's going to be the same experience every time. You'll see different hotels, but it's a predictable experience. With AI, you can't predict that it's going to be the exact same thing, the thing that you plan it to be every time. And then the other is there's this trade-off between agency and control. How much will the AI do for you versus how much should the person still be in charge? And what I'm hearing is the big point here is this significantly changes the way you should be building product. And we're going to talk about the impact on how the product development lifecycle should change as a result.\n\n(00:11:35):\nIs there anything else you want to add there before we get into that?\n\nKiriti Badam (00:11:39):\nYeah, it's definitely one of the key points that this kind of distinction needs to exist in your mind when you're starting to build. For example, think about if your objective is to hike Half Dome in Yosemite. You don't start hiking it every day, but you start training yourself in minor parts and then you slowly improve and then you go to the end goal. I feel like that's extremely similar to what you want to build AI products in the sense that when you don't start with agents with all the tools and all the context that you have in the company in day one and expect it to work or even tinker at that level. You need to be deliberately starting in places where there is minimal impact and more human control so that you have a good grip of what are the current capabilities and what can I do with them and then slowly lean into the more agency and lesser control.\n\n(00:12:29):\nSo this gives you that confidence that, okay, I can know that, okay, this is the particular problem that I'm facing and the AI can solve this extent of it. And then let me next think through what context I need to bring in, what kind of tools I need to add to this to improve the experience. So I feel like also it's a good and a bad thing in the sense that it's good that you don't have to see the complexity of the outside world of all of this fancy AI agents force and feel like I cannot do that. Everyone is starting from very minimalistic structures and then evolving. And the second part is the bad thing is that as you are trying to build this one click agents into your company, you don't have to be overwhelmed with this complexity. You can slowly graduate.\n\n(00:13:16):\nSo that's extremely important. And we see this as a repeating pattern over and over.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:20):\nOkay. So let's actually follow that because that's a really important component of how you recommend people build AI stuff, AI products, AI agents, all the AI things. So give us an example of what you're talking about here, this idea of starting slow with agency and control and then moving up this rung.\n\nKiriti Badam (00:13:38):\nYeah. For example, a very important or very prevalent application of AI agents is customer support. Imagine you are a company who has a lot of customer support tickets and why even imagine OpenAI is the exact same thing when we were launching products and there was a huge spike of support volume as we launched successful products like Image or GPT-5 and things like that. The kind of questions you get is different. The kind of problems that the customers bring to you is different. So it's not about just dumping all the list of help center articles that you have into the AI agent. You kind of understand what are the things that you can build. And so initially the first step of it would be something like you have your support agents, the human support agents",

You kind of understand what are the things that you can build. And so initially the first step of it would be something like you have your support agents, the human support agents, but you will be suggesting in terms of, okay, this is what the AI thinks that is the right thing to do.\n\n(00:14:33):\nAnd then you get that feedback loop from the humans that, okay, this is actually a good suggestion for me in this particular case and this is a bad suggestion. And then you can go back and understand, okay, this is what the drawbacks are or this is where the blind spots are, and then how do I fix that? And once you get that, you can increase the autonomy to say that, okay, I don't need to suggest to the human. I'll actually show the answer directly to the customer. And then we can actually add more complexity in terms of, okay, I was only answering questions based on health center articles, but now let me add new functionality. I can actually issue refunds to the customers. I can actually raise feature requests with the engineering team and all of these things. So if you start with all of this on day one, it's incredibly hard to control the complexity.\n\n(00:15:19):\nSo we recommend building step by step and then increasing it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:23):\nAwesome. And you have a visual actually that we'll share of what this looks like. But just to kind of mirror back what you're describing, this idea of start with high control, low agency, the example you gave is the support agents just kind of giving suggestions, is not able to do anything, the user is in charge. And then as that becomes useful and you are confident it's doing the right sort of work, you give it a little more agency and you kind of pull back on the control the user has. And then if that's starting to go well, then you give it more agency and the user needs less control to control it. Awesome.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:16:02):\nI think the higher level idea here is with AI systems, it's all about behavior calibration. It's incredibly impossible to predict upfront how your system behaves. Now, what do you do about it? You make sure that you don't ruin your customer experience or your end user experience. You keep that as is, but then remove the amount of control that the human has. And there is no single right way of doing it. You can decide how to constrain that autonomy. I mean, a different example of how you could constrain autonomy is pre-authorization use cases. Insurance pre-authorization is a very ripe use case for AI because clinicians spend a lot of time pre-authorizing things like blood tests, MRIs and things like that. And there are some cases which are more of low hanging fruits. For instance, MRIs and block tests, because as soon as you know patient's information, it's easier to approve that and AI could do that versus something like an invasive surgery, et cetera, is more high risk. You don't want to be doing that autonomously.\n\n(00:17:11):\nSo you can kind of determine which of these use cases should go through that human and the loop layer versus which of the use cases AI can conveniently handle. And then all through this process, you're also logging what the human is doing because you want to build a flywheel that you could use in order to improve your system. So you're essentially not showing the user experience, not eroding trust, at the same time logging what humans would otherwise do so that you can continuously improve your system.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:41):\nSo let me give you a few more examples of this kind of progression that you recommend. And the reason I'm spending so much time here is this is a really key part of your recommendation to help people build more successful AI products. This idea of start slow with high control and low agency and then build up over time once you've built confidence that it's doing the right sort of work. So a few more examples that you shared in your post that I'll just read. So say you're building a coding assistant, V1 would be just suggest inline completion and boilerplate snippets. V2 would be generate larger blocks like tests or refactors for humans to review. And then V3 is just apply the changes and open PRs autonomously. And then another example is a marketing assistant. So V1 would be draft emails or social copy, just like here's what I would do.\n\n(00:18:26):\nV2 is build a multi-step campaign and run the campaign. And V3 is just launch it A/B tested auto-optimize campaigns across channels. Awesome. Yeah. And again, just to summarize where we're at, just to give people the advice we've shared so far. One is just important to understand AI products are different. They're non-deterministic. And you pointed out, and I forgot to actually mirror back this point, both on the input and the output. The user experience is non-deterministic.People will see different things, different outputs, different chat conversations, different maybe UI if it's designing the UI for you. And also the output obviously is going to be non-terministic. So that's a problem and a challenge. And then-\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:19:08):\nI mean, if you think of it's also the most beautiful part of AI, which is, I mean, we are all much more comfortable talking",

And then-\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:19:08):\nI mean, if you think of it's also the most beautiful part of AI, which is, I mean, we are all much more comfortable talking than following a bunch of buttons and all of that. So the bar to using AI products is much lower because you can be as natural as you would be with humans, but that's also the problem, which is there are tons of ways we communicate and you want to make sure that that intent is rightly communicated and the right actions are taken because most of your systems are deterministic and you want to achieve a deterministic outcome, but with non-deterministic technology and that's where it gets a little messy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:44):\nAwesome. Okay. I love the optimistic version of why this is good. Okay. And then the other piece is this idea of this trade-off of autonomy versus control when you're designing a thing. And I imagine what you're seeing is people try to jump to the ideal, like the V3 immediately and that's when they get into trouble both. It's probably a lot harder to build that and it just doesn't work. And then they're just like, \"Okay, this is a failure. What are we even doing?\"\n\nKiriti Badam (00:20:08):\nExactly. I feel there's a bunch of things that you actually have to get confidence in before you get to V3. And it's easy to get overwhelmed that, oh, my AI agent is doing these things wrong in a hundred different ways and you're not going to actually tabulate all of them and fix it. Even though you've learned how do you deal with the evaluation practices and stuff like that, if you're starting on the wrong spot, you are actually going to have a hard time correcting things from there. And when you start small and when you start with building a very minimalistic version with high human control and low agency, it also forces you to think about what is the problem that I'm going to solve. We use this term called problem first. And to me, it was obvious in the sense that that I do need to think about the problem, but it's incredible how well it resonates with the people that in all this advancements of the AI that we are seeing, one easy, slippery slope is to just keep thinking about complexities of the solution and forget the problem that you're trying to solve.\n\n(00:21:10):\nSo when you're trying to start at a smaller scale of autonomy, you start to really think about what is the problem that I'm trying to solve and how do I break it down into levels of autonomy that I can build later? So that is incredibly useful and we keep repeating this part and over and over with everyone we talk to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):\nAnd there's so many other benefits to limiting autonomy because there's just danger also of the thing doing too much for you and just messing up your, I don't know, your database, sending out all these emails you never expected. And there's like so many reasons this is a good idea.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:21:45):\nYep. I recently read this paper from a bunch of folks at UC Berkeley. Basically Matei Zaharia, [inaudible 00:21:54] and the folks at Databricks and it said about 74% or 75% of the enterprises that they had spoken to, their biggest problem was reliability. And that's also why they weren't comfortable deploying products to their end users or building customer facing products because they just weren't sure or they just weren't comfortable doing that and exposing their users to a bunch of these risks. And that's also why they think a lot of AI products today have to do with productivity because it's much low autonomy versus end-to-end agents that would replace workflows. And yeah, I love their work otherwise as well, but I think that's very in line with what at least we are seeing at my startup as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:38):\nOkay. Very interesting. There's an episode that'll come out before this conversation where we go deep into another problem that this avoids, which is around prompt injection and jailbreaking and just how big of a risk that is for AI products where it's essentially an unsolved and unsolvable problem potentially. I'm not going to go down that track, but that's a pretty scary conversation we had that'll be out before this conversation.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:23:02):\nI think that will be a huge problem once systems go mainstream. We're still so busy building AI products that we're not worried about security, but it will be such a huge problem to kind of, especially with this non-deterministic API again. So you're kind of stuck because there are tons of instructions that you could inject within your prompt and then it's going really bad.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:28):\nOkay. Let's actually spend a little time here because it's actually really interesting to me and no one's talking about this stuff, which is like the conversation we had is just it's pretty easy to get AI to do stuff it shouldn't do. And there's all these guardrail systems people put in place, but turns out these guardrails aren't actually very good and you can always get around them. And to your point, as agents become more autonomous and robots, it gets pretty scary that you could get AI to do things you shouldn't do.\n\nKiriti Badam (00:23:54):\nI think this is definitely a problem, but I feel in the current spectrum of customers",

So with the right sort of human in the loop points in here, I feel we can actually avoid a bunch of these things and focus more towards streamlining the processes. And I am more on the optimist side in the sense that you need to try and adopt this before actually trying to be only for highlighting the negative aspects of what could go wrong.\n\n(00:24:47):\nSo I feel like strongly that companies has this adopt this, they definitely ... No company at OpenAI we talk to has never had been the case that, oh, AI cannot help me in this case. It has always been that, oh, there is this set of things that it can optimize for me and then let me see how I can adopt it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:06):\nSweet. I always like the optimistic perspective. I'm excited for you to listen to this and see what you think because it's really interesting. And to your point, there's a lot of things to focus on. It's one of many things to worry about and think about. Okay, let's get back on track here. So we've shared a bunch of pro-tips and important piece of advice. Let me ask, what other patterns and kind of ways of working do you see in companies that do this well and teams that build AI products successfully? And then just what are the most common pitfalls people fall into? So we could just maybe start with, what are other ways that companies do this well, build AI products successfully?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:25:43):\nI almost think of it as like a success triangle with three dimensions that's never always technical. Every technology problem is a people problem first. And with companies that we have worked with, it's these three dimensions, like great leaders, good culture and technical prowess. With leaders itself, we work with a lot of companies for their AI transformation, training, strategy and stuff like that. And I feel like a lot of companies, the leaders have built intuitions over 10 or 15 years and they're kind of highly regarded for those intuitions. But now with AI in the picture, those intuitions will have to be relearned and leaders have to be vulnerable to do that. I used to work with the CEO of now Rackspace, Gagan. So he would have this block every day in the morning, which would say catching up with AI 4:00 to 6:00 AM, and he would not have any meetings or anything like that.\n\n(00:26:42):\nAnd that was just his time to pick up on the latest AI podcast or information and all of that. And he would have weekend vibe coding sessions and stuff like that. So I think leaders have to get back to being hands-on. And that's not because they have to be implementing these things, but more of rebuilding their intuitions because you must be comfortable with the fact that your intuitions might not be right and you probably are the dumbest person in the room and you want to learn from everyone. And that I've seen that being a very distinguishing factor of companies that build products which are successful because you're kind of bringing in that top-down approach. It's almost always impossible for it to be bottom-up. You can't have a bunch of engineers go and get buy-in from the leader if they just don't trust in the technology or if they have misaligned expectations about the technology.\n\n(00:27:34):\nI've heard from so many folks who are building that our leaders just don't understand the extent to which AI can solve a particular problem or they just vibe code something and assume it's easy to take it to production and you really need to understand the range of what AI can solve today so that you can guide decisions within the company. The second one is the culture itself. And again, I work with enterprises where AI is not their main thing and they need to bring in AI into their processes just because a competitor is doing it. And just because it does make sense because there are use cases that are very ripe. Then along the way, I feel a lot of companies have this culture of FOMO and you will be replaced and those kind of things and people get really afraid. Subject matter experts are such a huge part of building AI products that work because you really need to consult them to understand how your AI is behaving or what the ideal behavior should be.\n\n(00:28:27):\nBut then I've spoken to a bunch of companies where the subject matter experts just don't want to talk to you because they think their job is being replaced. So I mean, again, this comes from the leader itself. You want to build a culture of empowerment, of augmenting AI into your own workflows so that you can 10X at what you're doing instead of saying that probably you'll be replaced if you don't adopt AI and stuff like that. So that kind of an empowering culture always helps. You want to make your entire organization be in it together and make AI work for you instead of trying to guard their own jobs",

You want to build a culture of empowerment, of augmenting AI into your own workflows so that you can 10X at what you're doing instead of saying that probably you'll be replaced if you don't adopt AI and stuff like that. So that kind of an empowering culture always helps. You want to make your entire organization be in it together and make AI work for you instead of trying to guard their own jobs, et cetera. And with AI, it's also true that it opens up a lot more opportunities than before. So you could have your employees doing a lot more things than before and 10x their productivity. And the third one is the technical part which we talk about.\n\n(00:29:18):\nI think folks that are successful are incredibly obsessed about understanding their workflows very well and augmenting parts that could be ripe for AI versus the ones that might need human in the loop somewhere, et cetera. Whenever you're trying to automate some part of a workflow, it's never the case that you could use an AI agent and that will solve your problems. It's always, you probably have a machine learning model that's going to do some part of the job. You have deterministic code doing some part of the job. So you really need to be obsessed with understanding that workflow so you can choose the right tool for the problem instead of being obsessed with the technology itself. And another pattern I see is also folks really understand this idea of working with a non-deterministic API, which is your LLM. And what that means is they also understand the AI development lifecycle looks very different and they iterate pretty quickly, which is can I build something iterate quickly in a way that it doesn't ruin my customer experience at the same time gives me enough amount of data so that I can estimate behavior.\n\n(00:30:31):\nSo they build that flywheel very quickly. As of today, it's not about being the first company to have an agent among your competitors. It's about, have you built the right flywheels in place so that you can improve over time? When someone comes up to me and says, \"We have this one click agent, it's going to be deployed in your system.\" And then in two or three days, it'll start showing you significant gains. I would almost be skeptical because it's just not possible. And that's not because the models aren't there, but because enterprise data and infrastructure is very messy and you need a bit to ... Even the agent needs a bit to understand how these systems work. There are very messy taxonomies everywhere. People tend to do things like get customer data, we want, get customer data, we do, and these kind of things. And all those functions exist and they're being called and basically there's a lot of tech debt that you need to deal with.\n\n(00:31:23):\nSo most of the times, if you're obsessed with the problem itself and you understand your workflows very well, you will know how to improve your agents over time instead of just slapping an agent and assuming that it'll work from day one. I probably will go as far to say that if someone's selling you one click-agents, it's pure marketing. You don't want to buy into that. I would rather go with a company that says, \"We're going to build this pipeline for you,\" and that will learn over time and build a flywheel to improve than something that's going to work out of the box. To replace any critical workflow or to build something that can give you significant ROI, it easily takes four to six months of work, even if you have the best data layer and infrastructure layer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:05):\nAmazing. There's a lot there that resonates so deeply with other conversations I've been having on this podcast. One is just for a company to be successful at seeing a lot of impact from AI, the founder-CEO has to be deep into it. I had Dan Shipper on the podcast and they work with a bunch of companies helping them adopt AI. And he said that's the number one predictor of success. Is the CEO chatting with ChatGPT, Claude, whatever, many times a day. I love this example you gave with the Rackspace CEO has catch up on AI news in the morning every day. I was imagining he'd be chatting with the chatbot versus reading news.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:32:42):\nWith the kind of information you have as of today, you could just ... I mean, you want to choose the right channels as well because everybody has an opinion. So whose opinion do you want to bank on? I feel like having that good quality set of people that you're listening to really makes sense. So he just has a list of two or three sources that he always looks at. And then he comes back with a bunch of questions and bounces it around with a bunch of AI experts to see what they think about it. And I was part of that group, so I kind of know-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:11):\nI love that.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:33:13):\n... about the questions that he comes up with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:13):\nThat's cool.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:33:15):\nIt's pretty cool. I was like, \"Why are you doing so much?\" And then he says, \"It trickles down into a bunch of decisions that we take.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:21):\nOkay.

I was like, \"Why are you doing so much?\" And then he says, \"It trickles down into a bunch of decisions that we take.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:21):\nOkay. Let me talk about another topic that's very ... It's been a hot topic on this podcast. It was a hot topic on Twitter for a while, evals. A lot of people are obsessed with evals, think they're the solution to a lot of problems in AI. A lot of people think they're overrated that you don't need evals. You can just feel the vibes and you'll be all right. What's your take on evals? How far does that take people in solving a lot of the problems that you talk about?\n\nKiriti Badam (00:33:47):\nIn terms of what is going on in the community, I feel there's just this false dichotomy of this either evals is going to solve everything or online monitoring or production monitoring is going to solve everything. And I find no reason to trust one of the extremes in the sense that I will entirely bank my application on this or like that to solve the thing. So if you take a step back, think of what are evals. Evals are basically your trusted product thinking or your knowledge about the product that is going into this set of data sets that you're going to build in the sense that this is what matters to me. This is the kind of problems that my agent should not do and let me build a list of datasets so that I'm going to do well on those. And in terms of production monitoring, what you're doing there is you're deploying your application and then you're having some sort of key metrics that actually communicate back to you on how customers are using your product.\n\n(00:34:47):\nYou could be deploying any agent and if the customer is giving a thumbs up for your interaction, you better want to know that. So that is what production monitoring is going to do. And this production monitoring has existed for products for a long time, just that now with the AI agents, you need to be monitoring a lot more granularity. It's not just the customer always giving you explicit feedback, but there is many implicit feedback that you can get. For example, in ChatGPT, if you are liking the answer, you can actually give a thumbs up. Or if you don't like the answer, sometimes customers don't give you thumbs down, but actually regenerate the answer. So that is a clear indication that the initial answer that regenerator is not meeting the customer's expectation. So these are the kind of implicit signals you always need to think about.\n\n(00:35:35):\nAnd that spectrum has been increasing in terms of production monitoring. Now let's come back to the initial topic of like, okay, is it evals or is it production monitoring? What does it matter? So I feel, again, we go back to this problem first approach of what is it that you're trying to build. You're trying to build a reliable application for your customers that's not going to do a bad thing. It's always going to do the right thing. Or if it is doing a wrong thing, you're basically alerted very quickly. So I break this down into two parts. One is nobody goes into deploying an application without actually just testing that. This testing could be wipes or this testing could be, \"Okay, I have this 10 questions that it should not go wrong no matter what changes I make, and let me build this and let's call this an evaluation dataset.\" Now, let's say you build this, you deployed this, and then you figured, \"Okay, now I need to understand whether it's doing the right thing or not.\"\n\n(00:36:32):\nSo if you're a high throughput or a high transaction customer, you cannot practically sit and evaluate all the traces. You need some indication to understand what are the things that I should look at. And this is where production monitoring comes into the picture that you cannot predict the base in which your agent could be doing wrong, but all of these other implicit signals and explicit signals, those are going to communicate back to you what are the traces that you need to look at. And that is where production monitoring helps. And once you get this kind of traces, you need to examine what are the failure patterns that you're seeing in these different types of interactions. And is there something that I really care about that should not happen? And if that kind of failure modes are happening, then I need to think about building an evaluation dataset for it.\n\n(00:37:20):\nAnd okay, let's say I built an evaluation dataset for my agent trying to offer refunds where explicitly I have configured it not to. So I built this evaluation dataset and then I made my changes in tools or prompts or whatever, and then I deployed the second version of the product. Now there is no guarantee that this is the only problem that you're going to see. You still need production monitoring to actually catch different kinds of problems that you might encounter. So I feel evals are important, production monitoring is important, but this notion of only one of them is going to solve things for you that is completely dismissible in my opinion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:58):\nAll right. A very reasonable answer. And the point here isn't, it's not just as simple as do both. It's more that there are different things to catch and one approach won't catch all the things you need to be paying attention to.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:38:11):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:12):\nAwesome.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:38:13):\nI want to take two steps back and kind of talk about how much weight the term evals has had to take in the",

And then you have folks saying that evals is pretty much everything, which is the feedback loop you're supposed to be building to improve your products. Now, step back as a beginner and kind of think what are evals? Why is everyone saying evals? And these are actually different parts of the process and nobody is wrong in the sense that yes, these are evals, but when a data labeling company is telling you that our experts are writing evals, they're actually referring to error analysis or experts just leading notes on what should be right.\n\n(00:39:02):\nLawyers and doctors write evals, that doesn't mean they're building LLM judges or they're building this entire feedback loop. And when you say that a PM should be writing evals, doesn't mean they have to write an LLM judge that's good enough for production. I think there are also very prescriptive ways of doing this and plus one to KD, which is you cannot predict upfront if you need to be building an LLM judge versus you need to be using implicit signals from production monitoring, et cetera. I think Martin Fowler at some point had this term called semantic diffusion back in the 2000s, which kind of means that someone comes up with a term, everybody starts butchering it with their own definitions and then you kind of lose the actual definition of it. That is what is happening to evals or agents or any word in AI as of today, everybody kind of sees a different side to it, I guess.\n\n(00:39:54):\nBut if you make a bunch of practitioners sit together and ask them, \"Is it important to build an actionable feedback loop for AI products?\" I think all of them will agree. Now, how you do that really depends on your application itself. When you go to complex use cases, it's incredibly hard to build LLM judges because you see a lot of emerging patterns. If you built a judge that would test for verbosity or something like that, it turns out that you're seeing newer patterns that your LLM judge is not able to catch, and then you just end up building too many evals. And at that point, it just makes sense to look at your user signals, fix them, check if you have regressed and move on instead of actually building these judges. So it all depends. I think one statement that every ML practitioner will tell you is it really depends on the context. Don't be obsessed with prescriptions they're going to change.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:45):\nThat's such an important point, this idea that, especially that evals just means many things to different people now. It's just a term for so many things. And it's complicated to just talk about evals when you see it as the stuff data labeling companies are giving you and things PMR, right? And there's also benchmarks. People call benchmarks a little bit evals. It's like-\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:41:03):\nI recently spoke to a client who told me, \"We do evals.\" And I was like, \"Okay, can you show me your dataset?\" And said, \"No, we just checked LM Arena and Artificial Analysis. These are independent benchmarks and we know that this model is the right one for our use case.\" And I'm like, \"You're not doing evals. That's not evals. Those are model evals.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:20):\nBut it makes sense. The word, it could be used in that context. I get why people think that, but yeah, now it's just confusing it even more.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:41:26):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:27):\nJust one more line of questioning here that I think that's on my mind is the reason this became kind of a big debate is Cloud Code. The head of Cloud Code, Boris, was like, \"Nah, we don't do evals on Cloud Code. It's all vibes.\" What can you share, Kiriti, on Kodex and the Kodex team, how you approach evals?\n\nKiriti Badam (00:41:44):\nSo Kodex, we have this balanced approach of you need to have evals and you need to definitely listen to your customers. And I think Alex has been on your podcast recently and he's been talking about how you're extremely focused on building the right product. And a big part of it is basically listening to your customers. And coding agents are extremely unique compared to agents for other domains in the sense that these are actually built for customizability and these are built for engineers. So coding agent is not a product which is going to solve these top five workflows or top six workflows or whatever. It's meant to be customizable in multi different ways. And the implication of that is that your product is going to be used in different integrations and different kinds of tools and different kinds of things. So it gets really hard to build an evaluation dataset for all kinds of interactions that your customers are going to use your product for.\n\n(00:42:38):\nWith",

So it gets really hard to build an evaluation dataset for all kinds of interactions that your customers are going to use your product for.\n\n(00:42:38):\nWith that said, you also need to understand that, okay, if I'm going to make a change, it's at least not going to damage something that is really core to the product. So we have evaluations for doing that, butt the same time we take extreme care on understanding how the customers are using it. For example, we built this code review product recently and it has been gaining extreme amount of traction. And I feel like many, many bugs in OpenAI as well as even our external customers are getting caught with this. And now let's say if I'm making a model change to the code review or a different kinds of RL mechanism that I trained with it, and now if I'm going to deploy it, I definitely do want A/B test and identify whether it's actually finding the right mistakes and how are users reacting to it? And sometimes if users do get annoyed by your incorrect code regis, they go to the extent of just switching off the product.\n\n(00:43:36):\nSo those are the signals that you want to look at and make sure that your new changes are doing the right thing. And it's extremely hard for us to think of these kind of scenarios beforehand and develop evaluation data sets for it. So I feel like there's a bit of both. There's a lot of vibes and there's a lot of customer feedback and we are super active on the social media to understand if anybody's having certain types of problems and quickly fix that. So I feel it's a ... How do I put this? It's like a domain of things that you do here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:08):\nThat makes so much sense. Okay. What I'm hearing, Codex, pro evals, but it's not enough.\n\nKiriti Badam (00:44:13):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):\nBut also just watch customer behavior and feedback. And also there's some vibes just like, is this feeling good? As I'm using it, generating great code that I'm excited about that I think is great.\n\nKiriti Badam (00:44:24):\nI don't think if anybody's coming and seeing that I have this concrete set of evals that I can bet my life on and then I don't need to think about anything else, it's not going to work. And every new model that you're going to launch, we get together as a team and test different things. Each person is concentrating on something else. And we have this list of hard problems that we have and we throw that to the model and see how well they're progressing. So it's like custom evals for each engineer, you would say, and just understand what the product is doing in its new model.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:58):\nIf you're a founder, the hardest part of starting a company isn't having the idea, it's scaling the business without getting buried in back office work. That's where Brex comes in. Brex is the intelligent finance platform for founders. With Brex, you get high limit corporate cards, easy banking, high yield treasury, plus a team of AI agents that handle manual finance tasks for you. They'll do all the stuff that you don't want to do, like file your expenses, scour transactions for waste, and run reports all according to your rules. With Brex's AI agents, you can move faster while staying in full control. One in three startups in the United States already runs on Brex. You can too at brex.com.\n\n(00:45:43):\nWe've been talking for almost an hour already, and we haven't even covered your extremely powerful software development workflow for building AI products that you two developed that you teach in your course, that you basically combined all the stuff we've been talking about into a step-by-step approach to building AI products. You call it the continuous calibration, continuous development framework. Let's pull up a visual to show people what the heck we're talking about, and then just walk us through what this is, how this works, how teams can shift the way they build their AI products to this approach to help them avoid a lot of pain and suffering.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:46:18):\nBefore we go about explaining the life cycle, a quick story on why Kiriti and I came up with this is because there are tons of companies that we keep talking to that have the pressure from their competitors because they're all building agents. We should be building agents that are entirely autonomous. And I did end up working with a few customers where we built these end-to-end agents. And turns out that because you start off at a place where you don't know how the user might interact with your system and what kind of responses or actions the AI might come up with, it's really hard to fix problems when you have this really huge workflow, which is taking four or five steps, making tons of decisions. You just end up debugging so much and then kind of hot fixing to the point where at a time we were building for a customer support use case, which is the example that we give in the newsletter as well.\n\n(00:47:13):\nAnd we had to shut down the product because we were doing so many hot fixes and there was no way we could count all the emerging problems that were coming up. And there's also quite some news online. Recently, I think Air Canada had this thing where one of their agents",

And there's also quite some news online. Recently, I think Air Canada had this thing where one of their agents predicted or hallucinated a policy for a refund, which was not part of their original playbook, and they had to go by it because legal stuff. And there have been a ton of really scary incidents. And that's where the idea comes from. How can you build so that you don't lose customer trust and you don't end up, or your agent or AI system doesn't end up making decisions that are super dangerous to the company itself. At the same time, build a flywheel so that you can improve your product as you go. And that's where we came up with this idea of continuous calibration, continuous development.\n\n(00:48:08):\nThe idea is pretty simple, which is we have this right side of the loop, which is continuous development, where you scope capability and curate data, essentially get a data set of what your expected inputs are and what your expected outputs should be looking at. This is a very good exercise before you start building any AI product because many times you figure out that a lot of the folks within the team are just not aligned on how the product should behave. And that's where your PMs can really give in a lot more information and your subject matter experts as well. So you have this data set that you know your AI product should be doing really well on. It's not comprehensive, but it lets you get started. And then you set up the application and then design the right kind of evaluation metrics. And I intentionally use the term evaluation metrics, although we say evals because I just want to be very specific in what it is because evaluation is a process, evaluation metrics are dimensions that you want to focus on during the process.\n\n(00:49:07):\nAnd then you go about deploying, run your evaluation metrics. And the second part is the continuous calibration, which is the part where you understand what behavior you hadn't expected in the beginning, right? Because when you start the development process, you have this data set that you're optimizing for, but more often than not, you realize that that data set is not comprehensive enough because users start behaving with your systems in ways that you did not predict. And that's where you want to do the calibration piece. I've deployed my system. Now I see that there are patterns that I did not really expect and your evaluation metrics should give you some insight into those patterns, but sometimes you figure out that those metrics were also not enough and you probably have new error patterns that you have not thought about. And that's where you analyze your behavior, spot error patterns.\n\n(00:49:59):\nYou apply fixes for issues that you see, but you also design newer evaluation metrics to figure out that they are emerging patterns. And that doesn't mean you should always design evaluation metrics. There are some errors that you can just fix and not really come back to because they're very spot errors. For instance, there's a tool calling error just because your tool wasn't defined well and stuff like that. You can just fix it and move on. And this is pretty much how an AI product lifecycle would look like. But what we specifically also mention is while you're going through these iterations, try to think of lower agency iterations in the beginning and higher control iterations. What that means is constrain the number of decisions your AI systems can make and make sure that they're humans in the loop and then increase that over time because you're kind of building a flywheel of behavior and you're understanding what kind of use cases are coming in or how your users are using the system.\n\n(00:50:59):\nAnd one example I think we give in the newsletter itself is the customer support. This is a nice image that kind of shows how you can think of agency and control as two dimensions. And each of your versions keep on increasing the agency or the ability of your AI system to make decisions and lower the control as you go. And one example that we give is that of the customer support agent, where you can break it down into three versions. The first version is just routing, which is your agent able to classify and route a particular ticket to the right department? And sometimes when you read this, you probably think, is it so hard to just do routing? Why can't an agent easily do that? And when you go to enterprises, routing itself can be a super complex problem. Any retail company, any popular retail company that you can think of has hierarchical taxonomies.\n\n(00:51:52):\nMost of the times the taxonomies are incredibly messy. I have worked in use cases where you probably have taxonomy that says some kind of hierarchy and then that says shoes and then women's shoes and men's shoes all at the same layer where idea you should be having shoes and then women's shoes and men's shoes should be subclasses. And then you're like, okay, fine. I could just merge that. And you go further and you see that there's also another section on the shoes that says for women and for men, and it's just not aggregated. It's not fixed for some reason. So if an agent kind of sees this kind of a taxonomy, what is it supposed to do? Where is it supposed to route? And a lot of the times we are not aware of these problems until you actually go about building something and understanding it.\n\n(00:52:39):\nAnd when these kind of problems, real human agents see these kind of problems, they know what to check next. Maybe they realize that the node that says for women and",

Maybe they realize that the node that says for women and for men that's under shoes was last updated in 2019, which means that it's just a dead node that's lying there and not being used. So they kind of know that, okay, we're supposed to be looking at a different node and stuff like that. And I'm not saying agents cannot understand this or models are not capable enough to understand this, but there are really weird rules within enterprises that are not documented anywhere. And you want to make sure that the agents have all of that context instead of just throwing the problem at that.\n\n(00:53:17):\nYeah. Coming back to the versions we had, routing was one where you have really high control because even if your agent routes to the wrong department, humans can take control and undo those actions. And along the way, you also figure out that you probably are dealing with a ton of data issues that you need to fix and make sure that your data layer is good enough for the agent to function. We do is what we said of a Copilot, which is now that you've figured out routing works fine after a few iterations and you've fixed all of your data issues, you could go to the next step, which is, can my agent provide suggestions based on some standard operating procedures that we have for the customer support agent? And it could just generate a draft that the human can make changes to. And when you do this, you're also logging human behavior, which means that how much of this draft was used by the customer support agent or what was omitted. So you're actually getting error analysis for free when you do this because you're literally logging everything that the user is doing that you could then build back into your flywheel.\n\n(00:54:22):\nAnd then we say, post that, once you've figured out that those drafts look good and most of the times maybe humans are not making too many changes, they're using these drafts as is. That's when you want to go to your end-to-end resolution assistant that could draft a resolution that could solve the ticket as well. And those are the stages of agency where you start with low agency and then you go up high. We also have this really nice table that we put together, which is what do you do at each version and what you learn that can enable you to go to the next step and what information do you get that you can feed into the loop, right? When you're just doing your routing, you have better quality routing data, you also know what kind of prompts you need to be building to improve the routing system.\n\n(00:55:09):\nEssentially, you're figuring out your structure for context engineering and building that flywheel that you want. And while I go through this, I want to also be very clear that two things. One is when you build with CCCD in mind, it doesn't mean that you've fixed the problem all for one. It's possible that you've probably gone through V3 and you see a new distribution of data that you never previously imagined, but this is just one way to lower your risk, which is you get enough information about how users behave with your system before going to a point of complete autonomy. And the second thing is you're also kind of building this implicit logging system. A lot of people come and tell us that, \"Oh, wait, there are evals. Why do you need something like this? \" The issue with just building a bunch of evaluation metrics and then having them in production is evaluation metrics catch only the errors that you're already aware of, but there can be a lot of emerging patterns that you understand only after you put things in production.\n\n(00:56:17):\nSo for those emerging patterns, you're kind of creating a low risk kind of a framework so that you could understand user behavior and not really be in a position where there are tons of errors and you're trying to fix all of them at once. And this is not the only way to do it. There are tons of different ways. You want to decide how you constrain your autonomy. It could be based on the number of actions that the agent is taking, which is what we do in this example. It could be based on topic. There's just some domains where it's pretty high risk to make a system completely autonomous for certain decisions, but for some other topics, it's okay to make them completely autonomous and depending on the complexity of the problem. And that's where you really want your product managers, your engineers and subject matter experts to align on how to build this system and continuously improve it.\n\n(00:57:10):\nThe idea is just behavior calibration and not losing user trust as you do that behavior calibration, I guess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:17):\nWe'll link folks to this actual post if they want to go really deep. You basically go through all of these steps by step, a bunch of examples. And the idea here is, as you said, that the reason, everything about what you're describing here is about making it continuous and iterative and kind of moving along this progression of higher autonomy, less control. And this idea of even calling continuous calibration, continuous development is communicating it's this kind of iterative process. And just to be clear, this naming is kind of ode to CI/CD, continuous integration, continuous deployment suite. And the idea here is that this is the version of that for AI where instead of just integrating into unit tests and deploying constantly, it's running evals",

And the idea here is that this is the version of that for AI where instead of just integrating into unit tests and deploying constantly, it's running evals, looking at results, iterating on the metrics you're watching, figuring out where it's breaking and iterating on that. Awesome. Okay.\n\n(00:58:08):\nSo again, we'll point people to this post if they want to go deeper. That was a great overview. Is there anything else before we go into different topic around this framework specifically that you think is important for people to know?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (00:58:18):\nI think one of the most common questions we get is, how do I know if I need to go to the next stage or if this is calibrated enough? There's not really a rule book you can follow, but it's all about minimizing surprise, which means let's say you're calibrating every one or two days and you figure out that you're not seeing new data distribution patterns, your users have been pretty consistent with how they're behaving with the system. Then the amount of information you gain is kind of very low and that's when you know you can actually go to the next stage. And it's all about the wipes at that point, do you know you're ready, you're not receiving any new information. But also it really helps to understand that sometimes there are events that could completely mess up the calibration of your system. An example is GPT-4o doesn't exist anymore, or it's going to be deprecated in APIs as well.\n\n(00:59:16):\nSo most companies that were using 4o should switch to 5 and 5 has very different properties. So that's where your calibration's off again. You want to go back and do this process again. Sometimes users start behaving with systems also differently over time or user behavior evolves. Even with consumer products, you don't talk to ChatGPT the same way you were talking, say, two years ago, just because you know the capabilities have increased so much. And also just people get excited when these systems can solve one task, they want to try it out on other tasks as well. We built this system for underwriters at some point. Underwriting is a painful task. There are agreements that are like loan applications are like 30 or 40 pages, and the idea for this bank was to build a system that could help underwriters pick policies and information about the bank so that they could approve loans.\n\n(01:00:15):\nAnd for a good three or four months, everybody was pretty impressed with the system. We had underwriters actually report gains in terms of how much time they were spending, et cetera. And first three months, we realized that they were so excited with the product that they started asking very deep questions that we never anticipated. They would just throw the entire application document at the system and go, \"For a case that looks like this, what did previous underwriters do? \" And for a user, that just seems like a natural extension of what they were doing, but the building behind it should significantly change. Now, you need to understand what does for a case like this mean in the context of the loan itself? Is it referring to people of a particular income range or is it referring to people in a particular geo and stuff like that?\n\n(01:00:58):\nAnd then you need to pick up historical documents, analyze those documents, and then tell them, \"Okay, this is what it looks like,\" versus just saying that there's a policy X, Y, and Z, and you want to look up that policy. So something that might seem very natural to an end user might be very hard to build as a product builder, and you see that user behavior also evolves over time, and that's when you know that you want to go back and recalibrate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:24):\nWhat do you think is overhyped in the AI space right now? And even more importantly, what do you think is under-hyped?\n\nKiriti Badam (01:01:34):\nAs I said, super optimistic in different things that are going in AI. So I wouldn't say overhyped, but I feel kind of misunderstood is the concept of multi-agents. People have this notion of, \"I have this incredibly complex problem. Now I'm going to break it down into, hey, you are this agent. Take care of this. You're this agent. Take care of this.\" And now if I somehow connect all of these agents, they think they're the agent utopia and it's never the case that there are incredibly successful multi-agent systems that are built. There's no doubt about that. But I feel a lot of it comes in terms of how are you limiting the ways in which the system can go off tracks. And for example, if you're building a supervisor agent and there are subagents that actually do the work for the super agent, supervisor agent, that is a very successful pattern.\n\n(01:02:24):\nBut coming with this notion of I'm going to divide the responsibilities based on functionality and somehow expect all of that to work together in some sort of gossip protocol, that is extremely misunderstood that you could do that. I don't think current ways of building and current model capabilities are right there in terms of building those kind of applications. I feel that is kind of misunderstood than overrated. Underrated, I feel it's hard to probably believe, but I still feel coding agents are underrated in the sense that I feel like you can go",

Underrated, I feel it's hard to probably believe, but I still feel coding agents are underrated in the sense that I feel like you can go on Twitter and you can go on Reddit and you see a lot of chatter about coding agents, but talking to an engineer in any random company, especially outside of Bay Area, you can see the amount of impact this coding agents can create and the penetration is very low. So I feel like 2025 and 2026 is going to be an incredible year for optimizing all of these processes.\n\n(01:03:25):\nAnd I feel that is going to be creating a lot of value with AI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:28):\nThat's really interesting on that first point. So the idea there is you'll probably be more successful building and using an agent that is able to do its own sub-agent splitting of work versus a bunch of, say, Codex agents. Will you do this task, you do that task?\n\nKiriti Badam (01:03:44):\nYou can have agents to do these things and you as a human can orchestrate it or you can have one larger agent that is going to orchestrate all of these things, but letting the agents communicate in terms of peer-to-peer kind of protocol, and then especially doing this in a customer support kind of use case is incredibly hard to control what kind of agent is replying to your customer because you need to shift your guardrails everywhere and things like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:08):\nYeah. Okay. Great picks. Okay. Ash, what do you got?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:04:12):\nCan I say evals? Will I be canceled?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:15):\nIn which category? Which bucket do they go?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:04:18):\nOverrated.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:20):\nOverrated. Okay, go for it. We won't let you get canceled.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:04:22):\nJust kidding. I think evals are misunderstood. They are important, folks. I'm not saying they're not important, but I think just this, I'm going to keep jumping across tools and going to pick up and learn if new tool is overrated. I still am old school and feel like you would really need to be obsessed with the business problem you're trying to solve. AI is only a tool. I try to think of it that way. Of course, you need to be learning about the latest and greatest, but don't be so obsessed with just building so quickly. Building is really cheap today. Design is more expensive, really thinking about your product, what you're going to build. Is it going to really solve a pain point? Is what is way more valuable today? And it will only become more true in the near future. So really obsessing about your problem and design is underrated and just rote building is overrated, I guess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):\nAwesome. Okay. Similar sort of question. From a product point of view, what do you think the next year of AI is going to look like? Give us a vision of where you think things are going to go by, say by the end of 2026.\n\nKiriti Badam (01:05:30):\nYeah, I feel there's a lot of promise in terms of this background agents are proactive agents who is ... They're going to basically understand your workflow even more. If you think of where is AI failing to create value today, it's mainly about not understanding the context. And the reason that it's not understanding the context is it's not plugged into the right places where actual work is happening. And as you do more of this, you can give the agent more of context and then it start to see the world around you and understand what are the set of metrics that you're optimizing for or what are the kind of activities that you're trying to do. It is a very easy extension from there to actually gain more out of it and then let the agent prompt you back. We already do this in terms of ChatGPT pulse, which kind of gives you this daily update of things you might care about.\n\n(01:06:20):\nAnd it's very nice to actually have that jog your brain up in terms of, \"Oh, this is something that I haven't thought about. Maybe this is good.\" And now when you extend this to more complex tasks, like a coding agent, which says that, \"Okay, I have fixed five of your linear tickets and here are the patches. Just to review them at the start of your day.\" So I feel that is going to be extremely useful. And I see that as a strong direction in which products are going to build in 2026.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:44):\nThat's so cool. So essentially agents anticipating what you want to do and getting ahead of you and I've solved these problems for you or I think this is going to crash your site. Maybe you should fix this thing right here or I see the spike here and let's refactor our database. Amazing. What a world. Okay.

Ash, what do you got?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:07:04):\nI'm all in for multimodal experiences in 2026. I think we have done quite some progress in 2025, and not just in terms of generation, but also understanding. Until now, I think LLMs have been our most commonly used modules, but as humans, we are multimodal creatures, I would say. Language is probably one of our last forms of evolution. As the three of us are talking, I think we're constantly getting so many signals. I'm like, \"Oh, Lenny's nodding his head, so probably I would go in this direction or Lenny's bored, so let me stop talking.\" So there's a chain of thought behind your chain of thought and you're constantly altering it with language that dimension of expression is not explored as well. So if we could build better multimodal experiences that would get us closer to human-like conversation richness. And you will also, just given the kind of models, there's a bunch of boring tasks as well, which are ripe for AI.\n\n(01:08:04):\nIf multimodal understanding gets better, there are so many handwritten documents and really messy PDFs that cannot be passed even by the best of the models as of today. And if it's possible, there'll be so much data that we can tap into.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:21):\nAwesome. I just saw Demis from DeepMind, AI, Google, whatever they call the whole org, talking about this where he thinks that's going to be a big part of where they're going, combining the image model work, the LLM, and also their world model stuff, Genie, I think is what it's called. Yes. So that's going to be a wild, wild time. Okay. Last question. If someone wants to just get better at building AI products, what's just maybe one skill or maybe two skills that you think they should lean into and develop?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:08:52):\nI think we did cover a bunch of best practices for AI products, which is start small, try to get your iteration going well and build a flywheel and all of that. But again, if you kind of look at it at a 10,000 feet level for anybody building today, like I was saying, implementation is going to be ridiculously cheap in the next few years. So really nail down your design, your judgment, your taste and all of that. And in general, if you're building a career as well, I feel for the past few years, your former years, say the first two, three years of building your career is always focused on execution, mechanics and all of that. And now we have AI that could help you ramp pretty quickly and post that. I mean, after a few years, I think everybody's job becomes about your taste, your judgment and kind of what is uniquely you.\n\n(01:09:49):\nI think nail down on that part and try to figure out how you can bring in that kind of a perspective. It doesn't have to mean that you should be significantly old, have years of experience. We recently hired someone and we use this very popular app for tracking our tasks and we've been using it for years and we pay a high subscription fee for it. And this guy just came with his own vibe coded app to the meeting. He onboarded us to all of it and he's like, \"Okay, let's start using this.\" And I think that kind of agency and that kind of ownership to really rethink experiences is what will set people apart. And I'm not being blind to the fact that vibe coded apps have high maintenance costs. And maybe as we scale as a company, we have to replace it or we have to think of better approaches.\n\n(01:10:36):\nBut given that we are a small size company now and just ... I was really shocked because I never thought of it. If you've been used to working in a certain way, you associate a cost with building. And I feel like folks who grew up in this age have a much lower cost associated in their mind. They just don't mind building something and going ahead with it. And they're also very enthusiastic to try out new tools. That's also probably why AI products have this retention problem because everybody's so excited about trying out these new tools and all of that. But essentially having the agency and ownership, and I think it's also the going to be the end of the busy work era. You can't be sitting in a corner doing something that doesn't move the needle for a company. You really need to be thinking about end-to-end workflows, how you can bring in more impact.\n\n(01:11:26):\nI think all of that will be super important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:28):\nThat reminds me, I just had Jason Lemkit on the podcast. He's very smart on sales, go to market, run Saster, and he replaced his whole sales team with agents. He had 10 salespeople and then he was 1.2 and 20 agents. And one of the agents, it was just tracking everyone's updates to Salesforce and kind of updating it automatically for them based on their calls. And one of the salespeople was like, \"Okay, I quit.\" And it turned out he wasn't really doing anything. He was just sitting around and he's like, \"Okay, this will catch me. I got to get out of here. So to your point about, it'll be harder to sit around",

    "content": "he was 1.2 and 20 agents. And one of the agents, it was just tracking everyone's updates to Salesforce and kind of updating it automatically for them based on their calls. And one of the salespeople was like, \"Okay, I quit.\" And it turned out he wasn't really doing anything. He was just sitting around and he's like, \"Okay, this will catch me. I got to get out of here. So to your point about, it'll be harder to sit around and twiddle your thumbs, I think is really right.\n\nKiriti Badam (01:12:07):\nYeah. I think to add on to that, I feel like persistence is also something that is extremely valuable, especially given that anybody who wants to build something, the information is at your fingertips even more than the past decade. You can learn anything overnight and become that sort of Ironman kind of approach. So I feel like having that persistence and going through the pain of learning this, implementing this and understanding what works and what doesn't work. And as you are going through this pain of developing multiple approaches and then solving the problem, I feel that is going to be the real moat as an individual. I like to call it pain is the new moat, but I feel that is exactly super useful to actually have this in, especially in building these AI products.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:56):\nSay more about this. I love this concept. Pain is the new moat. Is there more there?\n\nKiriti Badam (01:13:00):\nYeah, I feel as a company, I mean, successful companies right now building in any new area, they are successful not because they're first to the market or they have this fancy feature that more customers are liking it. They went through the pain of understanding what are the set of non-negotiable things and trade them off exactly with what are the features or what are the model capabilities that they can use to solve that problem. This is not a straightforward process. There's no textbook to do this or there's no straightforward way or a known credit path to be here. So a lot of this pain I was talking about is just going through this iteration of like, \"Okay, let's try this and if this doesn't work, let's try this.\" And that kind of knowledge that you built across the organization or across your own lived experiences, I feel that pain is what translates into the moat of the company. This could be a product of evals or something that you built. And I feel that is going to be the game changer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:59):\nThat is awesome. It's like turning a coal into diamond.\n\nKiriti Badam (01:14:03):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:04):\nOkay. I feel like we've done a great job helping people avoid some of the biggest issues people consistently run into building AI products. We covered so many of the pitfalls and the ways to actually do it correctly. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:14:25):\nBe obsessed with your customers. Be obsessed with the problem. AI is just a tool and try to make sure that you're really understanding your workflows. 80% of so called AI engineers, AIPMs spend their time actually understanding their workflows very well. They're not building the fanciest and the most cool models or workflows around it. They're actually in the weeds understanding their customer's behavior and data. And whenever a software engineer who's never done AI before, here's the term, look at your data. I think it's a huge revelation to them, but it's always been the case. You need to go there, look at your data, understand your users, and that's going to be a huge differentiator.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:09):\nThat's a great way to close it. The AI isn't the answer. It's a tool to solve the problem. With that, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for both of you. Are you ready?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:15:22):\nYay. Yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):\nAll right. So you can both answer them. You can pick one which you want to answer. Either way, up to you. What are two or three books you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:15:32):\nFor me, it's this book called When Breath Becomes Air, Lenny. It was written by Paul Kalanithi. I think he was an Indian original neurosurgeon who was diagnosed with lung cancer at 31 or 32. And the whole book is his memoir and just is written after he was diagnosed. And it's really beautiful, especially because I read it during COVID and all we ever wanted to do during COVID is stay alive. There are a bunch of really nice quotes within the book as well, but I remember one of them, he was kind of arguing against a very popular quote by Socrates, which is, \"The unexamined life is not worth living,\" or something like that, which means you really need to be thinking about your choices, you need to understand your values, your mission and all of that. And Paul says, \"If the unexamined life is not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining?\" Which means are you spending so much time just understanding your mission and purpose that you've forgotten to live?\n\n(01:16:32):\nAnd I think everybody who's staying in the AI era and building and continuously going through the space of reinventing themselves need to take a pause",

They need to stop evaling life too much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:46):\nI was going to say that. That's where my mind went. You got to write some evals for your life. Oh my God, we've gone too far.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:16:52):\nYep. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:53):\nBeautiful.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:16:53):\nThat's my favorite book.\n\nKiriti Badam (01:16:55):\nI like more of science fiction books. So I really like this 3 Body problem series. It's like a three book series. It has elements of grander than science fiction, life outside earth and how it impacts human decision making process. And it also has elements of geopolitics and how much important or valuable abstract science is to human progress. And then when that gets stopped, it's not noticeable in everyday life, but it can cause devastating effects. So I feel like AI helping in these areas, for example, is going to be extremely crucial. And that book is a nice example of what could happen otherwise.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:35):\nCompletely agree. Absolutely. Love. Might be my favorite sci-fi book except, or series even, and it's three. I have to read of all three, by the way. I find that it only got really good about one and a half books in. So if anyone's tried it and like, \"What the heck is going on here?\" Just keep reading and get to the middle of the second one and then it gets mind-blowing.\n\nKiriti Badam (01:17:52):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:54):\nIf you love sci-fi and you're in AI, you got to read this book called A Fire Upon the Deep by Vernon Vinge. Check it out. It's incredible. I saw Noah Smith on his newsletter recommend this book and there's sequels to it, but this is the one that's so incredible. And it's actually, it turns out it's about AGI and super intelligence and all these things, and it's just so epic. And no one's heard of it.\n\nKiriti Badam (01:18:19):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:20):\nThere you go. I'm giving you one back. Okay, next question. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:18:26):\nI started rewatching Silicon Valley and I think it's so true. It's so timeless. Everything is repeating all over again. Anybody who's watched it a few years ago should start rewatching it and you'll see that it's eerily similar to everything that's happening right now with the AI wave.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:41):\nThat's a good idea to rewatch it. I love that their whole business was like an algorithm to compress, like a compression algorithm. It's like maybe a precursor to LLMs in some small way. No, I get it. All right, Kiriti, what you got?\n\nKiriti Badam (01:18:54):\nI'm going to drag this and say lot a movie or a TV show, but there's this game I picked up recently called Expedition 33. It has nothing to do with AI, but it's an incredibly well-made game in terms of the gameplay or the movie and the story and the music. It's been amazing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:10):\nI love that you have time to play games. That's a great sign. I love that. Someone OpenAI, I'm just imagining you're ... There's nothing else going on except just coding and having meetings.\n\nKiriti Badam (01:19:20):\nYeah, it has been incredibly hard to find time for that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:22):\nThat's good. That's a good sign. I'm happy to hear this. Okay. What's a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:19:28):\nFor me, it's Whisper Flow. I think I've been using it quite a bit and I didn't know I needed it so much. The best part is it's a conceptual transcription tool, which means if you go to Codex and start using Whisper Flow, it starts identifying variables and all of that. And it's so seamless in terms of transcription to instruction. You could say something like, \"I'm so excited today. Add three exclamation marks,\" and it seamlessly switches. It adds those three exclamation marks instead of writing add three exclamation marks. And I think it's pretty cool. If you're not using it, you should try it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:03):\nI'll do a plug. Get Whisper Flow for free for an entire year for a year for free by becoming an annual subscriber of my newsletter.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:20:12):\nThat's how I got access to it, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:14):\nThere we go. I think I pitched this deal. I",

I think I pitched this deal. I think people don't truly understand how incredible this is. They're like, \"No way this is real. It's real.\" And 18 other products, lennysproductpass.com, check it out. Moving on. Kiriti.\n\nKiriti Badam (01:20:28):\nAwesome. I actually am a stickler for productivity. I keep experimenting new CLI tools and things which can make me faster. So I feel like a Raycast has been amazing. I've discovered all this new shortcuts that you can use to open different things, type in shortcut commands and things like that. And Caffeinate is another thing that I've recently discovered from my teammates. It helps you prevent Mac from sleeping so you can run this really long Codex task for four or five hours locally, let it build the thing and then you can wake up and be like, \"Okay, this is good. I like this.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:02):\nThat's hilarious, that combo. Codex and Caffeinate. You guys need to use it, build that yourself, an OpenAI version of that, or the Codex agent should just keep your Mac from sleeping. That's so funny. By the way, Raycast, also part of Lenny's product pass. One year for your Raycast. Amazing. Yeah.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:21:20):\nLenny didn't tell us these folks. Yes. These are actually our favorite products.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:25):\nThese are just two of 19 products. No Caffeinate though. I don't know if that's even paid. Okay, let's keep going. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to in work or in life?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:21:35):\nFor me, I think this is one my dad told me when I was a kid and it's always stuck, which is they told it couldn't be done, but the fool didn't know it, so he did it anyway. I think be foolish enough to believe that you can do anything if you put your heart to it, especially now because you have so much data at your hand that could be pointing towards the fact that you probably will be unsuccessful. How many podcasts made it to more than a thousand subscribers or how many companies hit more than one million ARR? And there's always data to show you that you won't be successful, but sometimes just be foolish and go ahead with it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:12):\nThat's great. Yeah.\n\nKiriti Badam (01:22:13):\nFor me, I am more of an overthinker. So I really like this quote from Steve Jobs that you can only connect the dots looking backwards. So a lot of the times there are numerous choices and you don't really know the optimal one to pick, but life works in ways that you can actually see back and be like, \"Oh, these are actually beautiful in terms of how our transition.\" So I feel like that is extremely useful in keep moving forward, keep experimenting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:39):\nFinal question. Whenever I have two guests on the podcast at once, I like to ask this question. What's something that you admire about the other person?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:22:48):\nI think with Kiriti, he's pretty calm and very grounded and he's always been my sounding board. I can throw a ton of ideas at him and he always comes up with, he's able to anticipate the kind of issues that might land into. And he's extremely kind and lets his work speak instead of actually doing a lot of talking, I guess. But if I had to pick one, I think he's the most incredible husband.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:20):\nReveal. Little did people know.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:23:25):\nWe've been married for four years and been the most beautiful four years of my life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:31):\nWow. Okay. How do you follow that?\n\nKiriti Badam (01:23:34):\nYeah, it's super hard to follow that. I would say I am extremely privileged in terms of working with really smart people in great companies in the Silicon Valley. And I feel the unique thing that stands with Aishwarya across like any other smart folks I've worked on is she has this really amazing knack of teaching and explaining something in a very understandable and easy to comprehend way. And that combined with persistence is super useful, especially in this fast-moving AI world that we are in the sense that there's so many new things coming up. It feels overwhelming, but when I hear her talk about, this is how you make sense of this entire thing, this is where it plugs in. I feel like, oh, that is so simple. I can also do that. So she empowers a lot of people by simplifying things and explaining things in the most understandable way.\n\n(01:24:25):\nSo I feel that is an incredible quality.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):\nAmazing. How sweet. I got to do this all the time. I need more guest to do it. That was great. Okay.",

Where can folks find stuff that you're working on, find you online, share your course link, and then just how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:24:41):\nI write a lot on LinkedIn. So if you want to listen to pragmatists who've been in the weeds, working on AI products and what they're seeing, you can follow my work. We also have a GitHub repository with about 20K stars, and that repository is all about good resources for learning AI. It's completely free. And if you like what we spoke today, we also run a super popular course. We leave a link to it on building enterprise AI products. And the course is a lot about unlearning mindsets and following a problem-first approach instead of a tool-first or a hype-first approach. So you can check that out as well. And if you don't want to do the course, we write a lot, we give out a lot of free resources, we have free sessions, so make sure you follow our work.\n\nKiriti Badam (01:25:27):\nYeah, I would also add that you can also find me on LinkedIn. I don't write a lot, I guess, but I'm super all excited to just talk to any complex product that you're building. And if you have thoughts on how you can use coding agents to make your life better or however the problems that you're seeing, always my DMs are open and we can have a great discussion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:47):\nAwesome. Well, Kiriti and Ash, thank you so much for being here.\n\nKiriti Badam (01:25:52):\nThank you so much.\n\nAishwarya Naresh Reganti (01:25:53):\nThank you, Lenny. This was so much fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:54):\nSo much fun. Bye, everyone.\n\n(01:25:58):\nThank you so much for listening.

What it means is that the way that we think about impact is growing a giant subscription business. That business exists to strengthen an informed democracy at a time when people are struggling to understand basic facts and struggling to understand each other. That means that impact for us is growing subscribers, but it's also when a deeply reported story triggers an important policy change or a new law.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:00:40):\nWhen you're a product manager, you're involved again in driving specific metrics like engagement or subscribers, but you're also trying to help stories find their real audience in ways that trigger just this whole different side of mission and purpose driven impact. I didn't feel that when I was at a place like Facebook.\n\nLenny (00:01:00):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today, my guest is Alex Hardiman. Alex is Chief Product Officer at the New York Times where she leads teams that build the company's news, cooking, games, audio, and advertising products. Prior to this role, she was Chief Product Officer at The Atlantic, and before that, she spent two years at Facebook where she led their news product amongst other things. As you'll hear in our conversation, Alex has been at the center of the storm so many times, including at Facebook right after the 2016 election.\n\nLenny (00:01:33):\nThen, at the New York Times right as COVID hit. She hears so many stories and insights about how the New York Times builds product, what it's like for product teams to work with journalists, what's good and bad about working at a company like the New York Times versus FAANG tech type company, and also how they went about acquiring and integrating world. I had such a blast doing this interview and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did. With that, I bring you Alex Hardiman. Today's episode is brought to you by Miro. Creating a product, especially one that your users can't live without is damn hard, but it's made easier by working closely with your colleagues to capture ideas, get feedback, and being able to iterate quickly.\n\nLenny (00:02:19):\nThat's where Miro comes in. Miro is an online visual whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I actually use Miro to come up with a plan for this very ad. With Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming with sticky notes, comments, slide reactions, voting tools, even a timer to keep your team on track. You can also bring your whole distributed team together around wire frames where anyone can draw their own ideas with pen tool or put their own images or mockups right into the Miro board. With one of Miro's ready made templates, you can go from discovery and research, to product roadmaps, to customer journey flows, to final mocks.\n\nLenny (00:02:57):\nWant to see how I use Miro? Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny to see my most popular podcast episodes, my favorite Miro templates. You can also leave feedback on this podcast episode and more. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens. I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listened to, like Tim Ferriss and Lex Fridman. I finally gave it a shot earlier this year and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine, especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1. One, with a small scoop that dissolves in water, you are absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and adaptogens.\n\nLenny (00:03:48):\nI like to think of it as a little safety net for my nutrition in case I've missed something in my diet. Two, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently, they're on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on the latest science, research studies, and internal testing that they do. Three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself. Right now, it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day, and that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health.\n\nLenny (00:04:25):\nTo make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one-year supply of immune supporting Vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/lenny. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/lenny. Take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance. Alex, thank you for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:04:52):\nThanks so much, Lenny. It's really awesome to be here with you.\n\nLenny (00:04:55):\nWhat's interesting is I think you may be the first product leader on this podcast who doesn't work at a big tech FAANG startup, and so I'm really excited to just dig into see what it's like to build product at a company like the New York Times.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:05:08):\nThank you. No, no, that sounds awesome. Let's dive right in.\n\nLenny (00:05:12):\nOkay, before we dive in, I'd love to get a little bit of background on just your career.",

I'm curious, what was your career path to becoming the chief product officer at the New York Times?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:05:23):\nThanks for asking. I've definitely spent most of my career right at the intersection of journalism and tech. I think in hindsight, if you were to ask my family, they probably wouldn't be that surprised, even though for me I was just rolling with it and following what felt like a really interesting set of problems to solve. But when I just look at my family, there is a ton of journalism in our DNA. My grandfather was a news anchor on the West Coast and I really revered him. My great-grandmother, she was pretty amazing. She actually started one of the first TV stations in the Midwest back in the '50s when it was still pioneering territory.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:06:01):\nFor me, one of my first, the dream for me was to try to find a way to build things in the new space. That's how I first ended up at The New York Times. I've had two stints at The New York Times. My first stint was for a decade, from 2000 to 2016, and it was during a really interesting time of pretty big transformation. There's so much to talk about within that decade, but I would say there are two really big things that happened in that moment. The first was really trying to work with the company to shift from being a print first product into a mobile first product. If you go back to 2006 and you think about it, the Times had no mobile presence whatsoever.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:06:40):\nEven the iPhone 2G and the App Store didn't come out I think until like 2008. We just really started investing in small mobile use cases, first on the margins and then more and more aggressively until we were just leading with mobile in everything that we did. New journalism formats, new product features, new revenue opportunities, that type of thing. Then, the second big thing that marked my journey at The New York Times was the shift to a direct to consumer subscription model. This was back in 2011, and there was just a lot of skepticism, including from people at The New York Times, about whether or not people would pay for quality journalism.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:07:17):\nWe brought in consultants and they said, \"Maybe over the course of history it'll get to one million subscribers, if you're lucky.\" It felt like a really big nervous [inaudible 00:07:27] at the time. But thank goodness it helped make a market for paid journalism, that has really helped a lot of news organizations find new ways to support quality coverage. But after a decade I did what I think a lot of people did, was you look around and you say, \"I love what I do, but I would love to go learn how to do product in the context of a product led digital first company.\" That's when I went to Facebook and I left in 2016.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:07:52):\nThe timing is actually pretty important in terms of my experience at Facebook, because when I first joined Facebook, I totally left the media space. I was focused on building out a team that was really trying to help micro sellers in markets like India and other parts of APAC, who were coming online for the first time in really low bandwidth areas, and just wanted to sell their goods through social commerce. Really looking at what WhatsApp and Line and other regional competitors were doing. We were focused on business messaging and the interoperability of the Facebook apps from more of a small business perspective. It was really awesome work.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:08:28):\nThen, the 2016 presidential election happened. I had only been there for a couple of months and as has been discussed very widely and reported widely, it was a wild time where there was just so much reckoning around misinformation, disinformation, election integrity, platform responsibility. I went over very quickly to help out on the news front where I led the product and engineering teams and it was really hard, really interesting work. I did that for a couple of years, decided-\n\nLenny (00:08:58):\nBefore we move on.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:09:00):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:09:00):\nI'm curious. Okay. Wait, you were leading the news product at Facebook during the election?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:09:03):\nRight after the election.\n\nLenny (00:09:05):\nRight after the election, after everyone was coming after Facebook trying to tear it down?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:09:09):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:09:09):\nWow. What year was that?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:09:13):\nI joined in early 2017 on that effort. The election was November, 2016.\n\nLenny (00:09:19):\nOh, my God. Before you move on, just what was that like? I don't know how one can describe that experience, but what do you think about when you think back to that time?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:09:28):\nI think about wartime product management, right? You're coming in, and I think there was ... What I appreciated about",

I don't know how one can describe that experience, but what do you think about when you think back to that time?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:09:28):\nI think about wartime product management, right? You're coming in, and I think there was ... What I appreciated about that time inside of Facebook was that there was just this incredible humility that was needed to really understand and first diagnose what was actually happening on the platform, and the approach to content on Facebook historically it was very binary. You basically had content from friends and family and then you had public contents. Public content could come from anywhere. It could come from a reputable news organization or it could come from my younger brother posting something and declaring it to be true.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:10:06):\nWhat we really tried to do very quickly was try to unpack the categories of public content to say that there actually is something that is factually accurate information, and that requires a certain craft from the journalistic trade. There are ways to really look at what is trusted information, how you make that a little bit more essential and visible to people on the platform, while then reducing things that are at best dubious or at worse truly misleading propaganda. It was really fascinating and really hard just because the platform hadn't been built to think about classification of coverage in that way.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:10:44):\nLet alone to have the right goals and responsibilities and incentives. There was just a ton of work to figure out how to make the platform far safer and far more informative after, I would say, a pretty intense election cycle.\n\nLenny (00:10:58):\nYeah. I was going to ask you about this later, but I feel like you're drawn towards just crazy, wild and crazy center of the storm roles. I guess that one you didn't expect necessarily to become that. I imagine The New York Times has a lot of that, but maybe a quick question there. What have you learned about just living in a world of just constant chaos and stress and urgency, endless urgency?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:11:21):\nI would say, if you did ask my family and my husband, he would say that I'm always attracted to the more chaotic problems. I just actually think that that's where product people thrive. The idea of being able to take all of these crazy inputs, trying to create a very structured model to figure out, \"Okay, what is true? Where do we have conviction? Where do we have questions? What are the most important problems to solve? How do you prioritize? How do you get a team rallied around a shared context in one single goal? These are actually the conditions where product manager, I think, thrive.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:11:55):\nFor me, just having been in the journalism space for about two decades now, it's just been or the tech space around news, it's just been a constant set of upheaval and transformation. Some things within our control, some things entirely outside of our control, and so I love it. For me, there's nothing else I'd rather be doing than trying to solve these problems in the world at scale. But it does take a certain amount of just grit and resilience, and the ability to really focus on the most important problems in a given moment. Also, the ability to let other things slide when you have to.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:12:32):\nBut again, I feel like these are core product skills that we look for in terms of leadership and grit, and the ability to drive through really, really tough problems that there's no playbook for, nobody has ever really done before.\n\nLenny (00:12:43):\nYeah. You said PMs thrive in this. I think some do. Some are like, \"No, leave me out of that.\"\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:12:48):\nI guess that's true.\n\nLenny (00:12:50):\nThere's a metaphor I like to use when I give PM's advice on where to work within a company, which is there's like the Eye of Sauron, which is the number one most important thing to the CEO at that time. My advice is often don't avoid that thing, usually, but work maybe to the side of that because you don't want to work on something that doesn't matter, that's like over in the shire land. You want to be something that matters but not maybe the most important thing. I feel like you're the opposite. You're like, \"Where's the Eye of Sauron focused? I'm going to go there and build stuff.\" That's pretty awesome.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:13:20):\nAwesome, sometimes, I'm sure there are moments too where it would be nice to chill, but I am drawn to those types of problems for sure. This feels like therapy, Lenny. I'm into it.\n\nLenny (00:13:31):\nTell me about your mother.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:13:34):\nShe's wonderful.\n\nLenny (00:13:37):\nOkay, great. That's the end of that one. I'll let you finish your career overview and then-\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:13:42):\nI feel like we're almost at present, which is I found that there was so much incredible experience that I was able to soak up and lean at a place like Facebook. For me, I really wanted to figure out how to apply that back into organizations that just had more of a classic journalistic mission and purpose, so I went to the Atlantic for a year. They had just been purchased by the Emerson Collective, so it was a really fun moment of just investment and expansion and ambition.",

They had just been purchased by the Emerson Collective, so it was a really fun moment of just investment and expansion and ambition. We launched their consumer business. Then, I came back to The New York Times in late 2019, right before the pandemic, and I've been there ever since.\n\nLenny (00:14:19):\nOh my, just your timing is impeccable every time.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:14:22):\nIt really is.\n\nLenny (00:14:24):\nI was doing some research on you before this chat and when you came back to The New York Times, there's all these stories about how big of a deal it was. Returns to The New York Times. That must have been something coming back, because you're there for 10 years initially, and then you came back. What was that experience like just coming back to something like that after being away?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:14:43):\nI felt really lucky. When I left The New York Times back in 2016, it was on really, really good terms. It almost felt as like, I'm going on an externship and I really hope that one day I'll be able to come back and just do my job better. Because I do think there's real value in being able to do product in a bunch of different contexts. You're just so much better at pattern recognition, learning how to solve a diversity of problems, learning to work through things. I had a lot of great support when I left, which was really important. I don't think everyone necessarily has the privilege of that support when they exit a company. When I came back, it was just a real moment of excitement. My interview process, I joked with my boss at the time. But it did actually feel more like therapy.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:15:30):\nWhen you've worked with people for a decade before and you go in, the conversation isn't the normal list of interview questions. It's like, \"Okay, here's what type of leader you were a couple of years ago. Here are the conditions on the ground now, how do you feel about X? How do you feel about Y? Are you still passionate about solving this? What else have you learned that's going to make you better?\" It was wonderful. It was one of the best interview processes because you're talking to a bunch of people who knew what you were like when you were leading as a person at a different point in your career and they're pushing you to be better. I felt like I got the best chance of a lifetime to come back and try to do my job better than I had been able to do it before, and that's pretty cool.\n\nLenny (00:16:12):\nYou've been there three years at this point?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:16:14):\nYeah, three years on Halloween, so coming up very soon.\n\nLenny (00:16:18):\nOh, wow. That's three days from now when we're recording. I wonder when this comes out. I'm curious, at a company like New York Times, which is, I imagine people think when they think product, they think it's the newspaper. At Airbnb we have this challenge where when we talk to hosts, \"Here's the product.\" You're like, \"What is your product? Is it our homes?\" You have to help people understand, \"Okay, when we talk product, we mean the website and app.\" What do you think of the product at The New York Times? Then, is it a challenge to help people understand, here's what the product team does?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:16:46):\nIt's a really good question. At the most basic level, I would say that our product is our journalism, which we then marry with a really compelling and useful user experience, in a way that helps people really act on our journalism so that they can understand and engage with the world around them. For about 150 years, our product was pretty simple. It was a printed newspaper, which is still very beloved today, but the UX of the newspaper was, it was a predictable structure. It was a very finite amount of news. It was time bound, which I think is a really lovely thing in terms of setting expectation. It also has the packaging of the newspaper just such serendipity, where you can move across news, opinion, culture, games.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:17:31):\nIt's a really great bounded product in and of itself. But about 25 years ago, when we started shifting over to digital, the web, and mobile, the world just fully opened up in a way. We just saw this really tremendous disaggregation and distribution of our journalism. We really tried to meet the moment by building a wide array of products in the news space to extend our reach. Our products then, our digital products were our website, our apps, newsletters, we dabbled with a lot in the VR/AR space early on. That was, I would say, the first big extension of our products. When we then pivoted though to a subscription model, it was a really interesting moment where we actually had to take more of a destination first approach.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:18:15):\nIt was almost like the beginning of us rebundling all of what we did, but on our own destination again, in digital destination. Because in order to build a really thriving subscription business, you really need a direct relationship with your customer as opposed to just relying on platforms to really",

Because in order to build a really thriving subscription business, you really need a direct relationship with your customer as opposed to just relying on platforms to really distribute your coverage. That's where, again, we really started rebundling the breadth and depth of value that people once found in the Sunday newspaper at digital scale. Now, today, our product bundle includes even so much more than news, which I hope we'll talk about a little bit more later. We've really scaled our products in a bunch of different categories where we feel like we can really help people understand and engage with the world.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:18:57):\nWe have cooking, we have games, we have sports, we have Wirecutter, which is a great innovation surface. We're playing with a new audio app all around audio journalism. We have now six fully fledged different product destinations. The next thing for us to do is to really figure out how to put those together into a bundle that really becomes the essential subscription for any curious English speaking person around the world, who really wants to know what's happening and wants to be able to, again, act and engage and make great decisions based on the products that we build.\n\nLenny (00:19:36):\nGot it. It sounds like the strategy is a subscription bundle where you just keep bundling awesome stuff into this bundle. It's an obvious thing everyone has, whether you want cooking or games or The New York Times online.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:19:48):\nI think that's right. We did this pretty great exercise and strategy projects over the last year. We took a look and we said, \"What is the largest addressable market where The New York Times can be truly valuable every single day to a group of people?\" What we found was that there are about 135 million people around the world we believe are willing to pay for the type of high quality journalism based products that the New York Times produces, in the categories of news, gameplay, cooking and recipes, sports, which is why we acquired the athletic shopping recommendations and audio. In order for us to really capture as much of that audience and really serve them well, there are really three things that we need to do to make that essential subscription work.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:20:37):\nThe first is we absolutely need to have the best news destination in the world. When you think about the New York Times, we actually have the solar system metaphor where for us news is the sun in the sense that it's why we exist. It is what gives us our brand heritage and reputation. It's what instills trust. It's also where we just have the largest audience when you think about a funnel for our portfolio, and it's also where we just have the most amount of high quality coverage. But then that sun helps you give birth to other satellite planets or products that have a lot of the same DNA. Again, like great trusted journalism, great journalists who just have real expertise.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:21:16):\nA great product experience that allows you to really unlock that value distribution reach, and the other ingredients that you would need for successful products to work. We're really focused on building out beyond news products that really help people engage with their passions and life needs that go beyond news. Then, the third thing is what you're describing as the bundle, how do we create a connected family of products that puts all of those things together so that wherever you come into the New York Times, to news or maybe through Wordle, you know that you're having the best experience within that category.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:21:49):\nBut then you also can quickly experience and discover everything else that we offer. That's the strategy and the vision, and it's a huge ambition. We want to get to 15 million subscribers by 2027. We're just over 9 million today, and I really think we can do it.\n\nLenny (00:22:06):\nAwesome. I actually wanted to chat about goals and how you think about success as a product team. I imagine the north star metric is what you just said, which is subscribers. If that's true, what other goals do you have across teams? Maybe even further, I'm packing a lot of questions into one question, but I'm curious just how your product team looks. How many PMs do you have? Roughly, how do you structure the teams? Then, roughly, what kind of goals do they all have to try and imagine the product team at New York Times?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:22:34):\nLet's start with structure. First, I love this question talking about my team because I love hyping them. They're amazing, and our success is truly only as good as our people. Yeah, it is so true. For us, when we think about our org structure, the way to set that up so that our people can really do their best work is that we have two axis. We have functions and then we have missions. I oversee two functions, which is the functions of product and design. The functions themselves, it's normal of what you would find in terms of functional responsibilities. We focus on standards of craft and excellence, career growth, career frameworks, equitable promotion processes, community of practices, skill development, all of that.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:23:21):\nBut missions is where a lot of the work happens. These are cross-functional teams, very similar to what we had at a place like Facebook. These cross-functional teams are led by usually a general manager, a",

These are cross-functional teams, very similar to what we had at a place like Facebook. These cross-functional teams are led by usually a general manager, a product leader, or an engineering leader. They're all pursuing the same high level goals and objectives. Cross-functional missions at the Times, it can include a lot of the same skill sets that you would find at a tech company, PMs, engineers, designers, data scientists, researchers, product marketers. But the big difference is we also have editors, if it's a product space that directly shapes our journalism. I can talk more about that because it's a pretty interesting differentiating factor.\n\nLenny (00:24:02):\nYeah, that's super interesting. There's a journalist within cross-functional product teams?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:24:05):\nExactly. But we have three different types of missions. We have consumer missions, we have monetization missions, and we have platform missions. Editors are embedded within consumer missions. Those are the missions that I oversee, where we're focused on creating really great products, again, in categories like news, cooking, games, audio, et cetera. That is where having editors involved, particularly like editors who are very product minded, it brings in the best of their expertise and marries it with a lot of the normal signal that you look for in terms of data research and other insights. When you're trying to make sure that you understand a consumer problem and that you're really finding the best creative solution for it.\n\nLenny (00:24:48):\nCool.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:24:49):\nIt is really cool. It's one of the, I think, most gratifying parts of working at a news organization like the Times. But if you work on a different mission, like a monetization mission, we have two really big ones. One is subscriber growth, the other one that's also really important is digital advertising. They build centralized commercial products that we can then scale across all of the products in our bundle. The subscriber growth team, for instance, they look at making sure that we have really great account ID management for subscribers. If you're buying a subscription through games or through news. Or, if you're on the digital advertising team, you're trying to make sure that we have a first party data program that's really privacy safe, that works as well in cooking as it does in the news space.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:25:33):\nThen, there's a totally different third bucket of mission that we have, which is all of our platform teams. This is everything from monetization platforms like our commerce engine, which is so important, because we're a subscription business, to data platforms where you might have our ML platform or experimentation tooling, to just basic infrastructure. Those are shared across the bundle, which just really helps make it so much easier, more efficient for really engineers to ship code and do their best work. A lot of this actually, I think, probably is pretty familiar to how you might organize at a tech company minus the editors.\n\nLenny (00:26:14):\nAwesome. On that info piece, that reminds me of something I definitely wanted to talk about, which is something New York Times is really known for is the visualizations and these immersive stories that you all put out. I'm so curious just how that gets done. I feel like if I was on a product team at a regular, like a big tech FAANG company, I'd be like, \"Shit, all these ad hoc things I got to do for all these stories, such a pain in the butt.\" That's so important to the New York Times and the online experience. I'm curious just like what is it like to build these things, say the election widgets, and all of that stuff?\n\nLenny (00:26:47):\nThen, I don't know, I was just reading a story about climate change and it's this really beautiful immersive story of just what is happening with the world. There's a bunch of questions there, but I guess roughly just how does that get done, something like that?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:27:01):\nWell, first, thanks for saying that. I really appreciate it. I do think there's something really special about some of the ways that we marry the journalism and the presentation. I want to start just by giving credit where credit's due, which is I think some of the most interesting and inventive and compelling formats, they actually do start off as one-off experiments that are spun up in the newsroom by embedded teams that we have within graphics, visual journalism, interactive news teams. This is where we have editors, journalists, engineers, data scientists, designers, literally all hunkered down together focusing on how to make one story come to life in the best possible way.\n\nLenny (00:27:37):\nWho has the idea usually? Is it like the journalists working on that, they're like, \"Hey, I think we should make something really great.\"\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:27:42):\nExactly. Yeah, one of the things ... We have a newsroom of over 2000 people. You basically have people who've been experts on certain beats like climate, for instance, for decades. They have the nugget of the idea. They start to do reporting and then they really pull in others from visuals, from interactive just to say, \"How can I really make sure that I can tell this story with as much impact and weight as possible?\" That's where the magic starts to happen, when you pull in all of those other skill sets together to help dream",

Can you get us on the list?\" How does that process go?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:28:26):\nNo, no, no. These are teams that are really autonomous in the newsroom. For one-off, truly special features, I'll give you an example of one that I found to be particularly powerful. I don't know if you read Jodi Kantor, who is one of our ... a really incredible investigative reporter. You might know for some of her work that she did around MeToo and Harvey Weinstein, in that investigation.\n\nLenny (00:28:46):\nYeah.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:28:47):\nShe recently did a piece on how employers are tracking and monitoring remote workers with tools like productivity scores. The story itself was designed to show a person's own productivity score in the moment as they read the article.\n\nLenny (00:29:02):\nOh, shit.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:29:02):\nIt was super visceral, really creepy in the most effective way. In my mind, that's the type of magical experience that only happens when you actually have dedicated designers, engineers, and others who can really sit down with a reporter to say, \"Let's figure out how to shape that story in the most magical way.\" The speed of news is so fast that you don't have time to mess with roadmaps. We really have teams who are freed up from some of the normal processes around that, so they can really just focus on storytelling for really big stories and pieces. But on top of that, what we do have is a storytelling product team. What they do is they really take notice of things that are starting to work in more of the experimental phase, some of these one-offs.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:29:50):\nThen, they work closely with editors to test and find product market fit for new formats that can actually scale across many parts of the report, so that over time when you open the app, the app is more accessible, more engaging, because we still have the traditional story based article, but we're also shifting more of the distribution of stories into video, into visuals, into live. If you even look at live, we've broken out of the tyranny of the article in many ways, where you have live reporter updates that are the size of length of tweets. People filing from the ground in Ukraine, trying to give you a sense of what's happening in a very immediate and real way.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:30:31):\nThat's where we do have teams, product teams who have to think in two modes. First, they have to be able to think in the moment with editors, where you might not always have all the right data at your fingertips and you just have to make a call, like, \"What is the best experience to tell this story in a really truthful, accurate, accessible way?\" Then, the other mode is when they're not shipping at the speed of news, they're trying to build end to end systems so that we're building the tooling to actually create the stories at the same time as the consumer experience, which is a totally different mode of system level thinking.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:31:04):\nIt's a very cool space. That product team is, they're pulling off some pretty incredible work because they can operate in those two modes. It's like, in the moment, in the moment of the story, but also trying to build the systems that allow you to reshape the composition of storytelling formats that we have across our products over time.\n\nLenny (00:31:23):\nThat is super cool. What percentage of these fancy stories are using that platform and building on something that already exists versus a one-off experiment would you say roughly?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:31:32):\nThe majority are on our platforms hands down. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:31:36):\nOkay. That makes sense. Then, just so I understand, so you said Jodi was the journalist?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:31:41):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:31:41):\nYou mentioned. Does she has a product team dedicated to her work?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:31:45):\nNo, what we have is we have a centralized interactive news team, graphics team, data journalism team. Those editors partner with different journalists when they have really big stories to help bring their story to life.\n\nLenny (00:32:00):\nI see. Do they have to come to this team and be like, \"Hey, I'd love your time.\" How does that prioritization ... Because I imagine a lot of journalists are coming to them like, \"Hey, my story is going to be awesome. We need you.\"\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:32:10):\nYou know what? To be totally honest, I'm not involved. Somehow it works.\n\nLenny (00:32:19):\nThat's a great leadership sign. It just works and you set it up and it's working, so that's great.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:32:25):\nWell, and the newsroom has set it up and something that is just, again, very interesting about the way that we are set up is that we have our newsroom and then we have our",

The business side is where you have all of the product teams and there is intense collaboration between the two, but they do have different leadership structures because that's how we maintain the independence of our coverage. Our product teams sit within the newsroom if they're focused on storytelling, live, anything related to the coverage.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:32:54):\nThe only distinction really that I think I'm trying to make is that product teams really help stories find their widest audience and be as engaging and as impactful as can be. But product teams don't have any influence over the selection of the stories. That is what the newsroom retains as editorial.\n\nLenny (00:33:14):\nOkay. You mentioned Wordle and you all acquired Wordle recently. I'm just curious what that was all like. I imagine it's still being integrated. Were you involved in the exploration and purchase process and what went on there?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:33:28):\nWordle has been such a fun ride. Maybe I'll first just bring you behind the scenes on how the deal came to be, and then we can talk a little bit more about what the integration process has been like.\n\nLenny (00:33:37):\nYeah, sounds great.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:33:37):\nI first heard about Wordle in early January because a New York Times reporter, Daniel Victor, actually wrote a piece about Josh Wardle, who's a software engineer in Brooklyn, and how he had created the game. It really is this gesture of love for his partner, and I certainly wasn't the only person to read through that column. Everyone inside the New York Times perked up. I remember reaching out to Jonathan Knight, who's the general manager of games, he's on my team. He had already taken notice well before the piece was published, and he had already reached out to Josh to see if he would be interested in having games join our portfolio.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:34:16):\nWe just all loved Wordle immediately because if you've played it, it shares a lot of the DNA of other really successful word games that we have at the New York Times, like Spelling Bee or the Crossword Mini. If anything, Josh was really forthright that he created it because he was inspired by those games. Then, in the context of just our subscription strategy, games is such an important category for us. We really see games and demand for games as this, basically, it's a counterpoint to the news. It gives people a chance to actually take a break. It's fun. It doesn't feel like empty calories. It's really time well spent.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:34:54):\nWe were just thinking of Wordle as such a wonderful addition to our games franchise to really give people more reasons to feel like they had a relationship with the New York Times every day. The whole thesis of the acquisition just made so much sense. Our team just very quickly engaged with Josh and the acquisition talks were incredibly fast. The whole thing took place in a matter of weeks, which is way faster than any other acquisition I've been a part of. It was a very amicable process. We were just super delighted to bring Wordle on board, but it happened in record speed.\n\nLenny (00:35:27):\nWell, yeah, it felt fast from the outside too. It became a huge deal. Then, \"Okay, New York Times buys them.\" Yeah, it's impressive. You said you acquired Athletic. How often are you acquiring companies?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:35:37):\nWe also acquired The Athletic, and that was back in around the same time. I think for now we feel like we actually ... we have all of the major categories to make the essential subscription work. For us to get to 15 million subscribers we really feel like news, sports, games, cooking, audio and shopping, those are the categories, and we just have to make them the best possible versions of themselves, those products, so that we can really provide just tremendous value every day to people. That doesn't mean that we won't make some other acquisitions. The next Wordle would absolutely love to hear about it.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:36:14):\nBut I do think there's also a real lesson for a lot of companies, not only about when you acquire what's the opportunity, but also are you ready to actually integrate an acquisition? We learned a lot just around Wordle in terms of what that process is like. I just want to say I'm really proud of how thoughtful and considerate our games team was about the integration process, because Wordle players feel such connection to the game. We really wanted to make sure not to interfere with the core magic of the experience. If you are an eight-year old kid or an 88-year old adult, there's real resonance with Wordle and people just have such a connection to it. We really wanted to make sure we didn't mess it up. Do you want to go a little bit deeper, just almost what that looks like?\n\nLenny (00:37:00):\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:37:01):\nBecause we definitely learned a lot. When we acquired Wordle, it was a simple web game with no backend. That meant that people's stats and streaks, which was that was the value in terms of social currency that people were sharing after playing, those",

Do you want to go a little bit deeper, just almost what that looks like?\n\nLenny (00:37:00):\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:37:01):\nBecause we definitely learned a lot. When we acquired Wordle, it was a simple web game with no backend. That meant that people's stats and streaks, which was that was the value in terms of social currency that people were sharing after playing, those stats and streaks were stored in local browsers. It was really important for us to make sure that the game board experience in the core loop of the game remained unchanged. But we also found that because everything was stored locally and people care so much about their stats and streaks, if they got a new iPhone, if they switched browsers, all of a sudden they lost all of that history that they had with the game.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:37:39):\nWhat we decided to do was undertake a project to connect Wordle to a New York Times account, which was free, because Wordle is a free game, just so that it knows who you are and so that your stats and streaks can be protected. Then, we could also bring Wordle to more surfaces because we wanted ... if you go to the homepage of the news app or if you go to the games app, we wanted to make it easier to find because people would come for Spelling Bee or Crosswords and they also wanted their Wordle. It was a pretty big effort to rewrite Wordle in our tech stack, give people the ability to store their stats and streaks, bring games to all of our major surfaces.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:38:16):\nWe just tried to do it in a thoughtful way, where we didn't break anything. The experience was hopefully seamless, and that the only thing you would notice that's changed is that the New York Times knows enough about who you are so that your stats carry over and you can play anywhere. But that doesn't mean that there aren't some surprises along the way, especially when you're doing backend work. We had this pretty crazy moment a couple months ago, right when the Supreme Court's draft ruling on Roe v. Wade leaked. An engineer on the games team happened to notice that the Wordle solution the next day was fetus. Which is just an extraordinarily bad coincidence, because the word had been loaded into the game by the game founder months beforehand.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:39:02):\nIt was so important for us that we didn't have ... this lovely diversion from the news feel almost like it was commentary on a very contentious story that was happening. I don't know if you caught wind of that, but you'd think that you could easily change the word on the backend, but because we were midstream on the migration process and some users were on the original Wordle game, others had migrated to the new version. It meant that we actually couldn't change the word on the backend for everyone, only for some people. This was a moment where we just had to come out and really tell the world, \"We're mid integration. We're really not trying to communicate more than Wordle being a fun diversion from the news. Here's what happened, and why.\"\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:39:50):\nEveryone understood. This is where coming out being really transparent about the facts and in some cases just exposing more about the product development process really helps demystify some of the rumors that people might otherwise think. It was one of those like, \"Oh, man, I couldn't have imagined that that type of terrible coincidence would happen.\" But you just have to be prepared for everything, even when you're integrating what should just be a fun game.\n\nLenny (00:40:16):\nImagine, no matter what you tell people, some folks are just not going to believe a very simple explanation of what was going on.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:40:23):\nIt's true. All you can do is be as honest and transparent. What I will say is a lot of people still think we try to make Wordle harder, we don't, I promise. It's not a thing.\n\nLenny (00:40:33):\nYeah, it's not like the crossword puzzle where it gets harder every day of the week.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:40:38):\nNo, no. It's not, it's not.\n\nLenny (00:40:43):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold.\n\nLenny (00:41:17):\nIf you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta, over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes.

Get started today. Are there any other stories that come to mind that reflect just how interesting/wild it is to work at the New York Times as a product leader?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:42:12):\nIf we could of go back to when I started at the New York Times, because I started in late 2019, it was just right before the pandemic. It was pretty wild to come back to the company and to get shifted into this moment of needing to build products that really were trying to help people through the moment. At a time when our journalists were covering the story and all of New York Times' employees were trying to live through it. It was COVID 24/7 in terms of work and life. For me, I remember in the earliest days when we were first really reporting on COVID and learning about it, we had reporters on the ground in Wuhan even before we knew how COVID was transmitted.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:42:52):\nThen, when the world shut down, for the Times, we went fully remote in March, 2020, and I remember the day so well because it was the beginning of spring break, of course, all plans were canceled. My kids, I had no idea what to do with them. My husband and I panic packed, put them in a car, drove to go see some friends in Vermont, and we decided we were going to do a kid daycare pool share just to figure out how to keep working with someone overseeing the kids. We got there late at night and I literally just went into a laundry closet and I didn't emerge for two weeks because my Slack was blowing up about all of the work that we needed to do to make our products as useful as possible.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:43:32):\nThe kids were being crazy and we just had to get to work. What was really stunning about this moment in time was that as people were getting sick and we were reporting about all of the trends that we were seeing, we saw that other institutions, especially the government, were not actually stepping up to help people understand the basic facts about what was happening. This is a product leader, it's a real wartime moment where you just need to blow up roadmaps, share context with everyone and say, \"Okay, everyone, we have a totally different mandate than what we did a couple weeks ago.\" Given the needs in the world and the mission of the New York Times and our purpose, which is to help people access information to make informed decision about their lives, we're going to do a whole bunch of these things.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:44:17):\nWe're going to build a comprehensive public data set of COVID cases. Nobody else is doing it. We really just started scraping and pulling this together, and what was a single spreadsheet at the time. We pulled a bunch of engineers from other teams to go help build out that database. We launched entirely new formats and data tools to make our journalism a lot more easier to follow. Things like tools to be able to look up infection rates and eventually vaccination rates down at your local zip code level. We made our most important COVID coverage free to everybody. It was really important that if it was something related to public safety, we didn't put it behind a paywall.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:44:53):\nOur mission is to do better than that. We really made sure that we had that information available to everyone. We also just found that for journalists who hadn't actually been in Wuhan, they just needed tips to an internal safety guidance for reporting, and so we made that publicly available. It was just one of those really interesting moments where everything felt so crazy in this moment of crisis. But building purposeful products that made a really difficult moment feel not only possible but promising, was one of the most unifying moments, I would say, for our teams.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:45:29):\nBecause even though people were working so hard and balancing work life and personal life, no one doubted for a second that the work they were doing was of greater good for the world. There's real privilege in being able to spend your time doing those things. But it's one of the biggest news stories of our lifetime and to be at the forefront of that, I think for all of us, was a pretty incredible and humbling experience.\n\nLenny (00:45:55):\nWow. People talk about having impact and driving impact and it's usually like, move this metric some percentage, but that is some incredible impact. Helping people avoid COVID, avoid dying, keeping their families safe. It's got to be some of the most fulfilling work that you and your team has done and ideally it wouldn't have happened, but it was also probably incredibly fulfilling.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:46:20):\nThank you for saying that. One of the most validating tricks that we did look at was we realized that at the height of the pandemic, when there was just so much confusion about literally what to do, how to live each day in March, 2020, we saw that half of the country came to the New York Times. There is something again that is just so powerful about very straightforward data journalism, deep reporting, service guidance on how to make a mask if you don't have one. Just like all of these basics. Just seeing the whole organization pivot from their normal job into this mode and was pretty incredible,",

You're like, \"Oh, my God, when is this going to slow down?\" How do you help people avoid burnout? How do you catch burnout as a leader on a product team?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:47:15):\nThis is one of the most honestly, hard and important topics that I think we're always still grappling with. As a company, we really did try to lead originally with giving people more time off, more support, like financial support and other assistance with daycare, health benefits, all of the basics. I think now what we're really trying to do beyond that is be so much more focused on the things that we need to do and all of the things that we're really happy to stop doing. Because part of, I think, context switching is one of the things that is really, really difficult. It's hard to context switch in your job.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:47:53):\nIt's really hard to context switch across your job and your life. There are a lot of things that we as a company can't necessarily control in people's lives, but within the job, the places where we can be so much more focused and thoughtful about the small number of important things that we must do at a given point in time, that's really the place where we're really trying to come in and be as empathetic and as honest about what we need to do and what we don't need to do. A lot of it really comes down to, I think, making hard calls. We're not always perfect at it. I'm sure that there are things that we could be more diligent about.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:48:27):\nBut I would say over on balance, we've seen a lot of people stay at the company because they're figuring out they work remotely, maybe they come back to the office. They're figuring out how to live their life in a very different way from a couple of years ago. We're really here to try to meet them and make that as possible as possible. We need incredible people across a bunch of different skill sets, a bunch of different backgrounds. The only way to do that is to really be very flexible and accommodating in terms of trying to meet people where they are in their lives, but it's tricky.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:49:03):\nThere is no perfect answer for this, but we're really trying because the success of the company only works when we have people who feel valued and they can do their best work and live really rich lives on top of that. I think we're all still figuring out what that looks like now that we're starting to come out of the official pandemic and really just learning how to live with COVID.\n\nLenny (00:49:23):\nRight, absolutely. You mentioned that you're all remote now. Is that the policy going forward?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:49:29):\nWe actually just started going back into the office a couple of days per week, which is very encouraged. We're still finding our groove. We do have a good number of people though who are fully remote as well. It's more of an evolution in terms of trying to find the right balance of taking advantage of in-person work, because there are some moments where it really does make such a difference when you have people together working through hard problems in real life. That camaraderie, those relationships really, really do matter. Also, being realistic about the fact that there are a lot of people who would love to work at the New York Times, but might not be able to live in the New York City area.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:50:11):\nSo, how do we make sure that we can be a remote friendly company for them too? Yeah, so we're very hybrid, we're still testing our way through it. But by and large, we're shipping so much tremendous work, which I think is a reflection of us being able to do the hybrid thing and just try to get better and better at it each day, each week.\n\nLenny (00:50:30):\nYeah, it's hard. As an outsider, I can't imagine a New York Times being all remote. It feels like that kind of company just, it's all happening in a building somewhere probably. I'm also a big fan of in-person, it feels like as a company, it feels like you have an advantage if you're working in-person generally.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:50:46):\nWe certainly see that, and so the center of gravity is in New York and is in the office, but again, with a lot of flexibility for people's lives. We're really trying to figure out that balance.\n\nLenny (00:50:58):\nJust a couple more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Where's the New York Times in the next five, 10 years as a product specifically different from other folks? Then, broadly, I don't know, if you have any insights or opinions on just what is the future of news, do share.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:51:13):\nI think the New York Times is in a pretty unique spot compared to other news organizations right now. I have tremendous respect for other high quality organizations like The Journal and The Post and The FT and The Guardian",

Then, broadly, I don't know, if you have any insights or opinions on just what is the future of news, do share.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:51:13):\nI think the New York Times is in a pretty unique spot compared to other news organizations right now. I have tremendous respect for other high quality organizations like The Journal and The Post and The FT and The Guardian. They're just doing such incredible work. But when I go back to what differentiates us, it's this idea of becoming an essential subscription that really helps people. It meets their most important news and life needs across all of the categories that we've been talking about, like news, games, audio, cooking, et cetera.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:51:44):\nUp until, I would say, this year we were more of a news brand with a collection of adjacent lifestyle products, but with the acquisition of Wordle and the Athletic, along with just the continued growth of cooking and Wirecutter and some of our other offerings, I really do think that has transformed us into a brand capable of really being that essential subscription that helps every single day people with news and life needs in a way that doesn't just associate the New York Times with [inaudible 00:52:12] categories. Imagine that you open the New York Times app and you are starting with a great breaking news story. Then, you skip over to the latest coverage in China.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:52:25):\nThen, you decide that you want to take a small break to play Spelling Bee, and then you want to plan a Korean dinner party with Eric Kim, who I don't know if you know has some of the best Korean recipes. He's amazing. Then, you're like, \"Wow, I need a rice cooker to be able to make that recipe, so I need to go get the best recommendation from Wirecutter.\"\n\nLenny (00:52:43):\nI just did exactly that, actually.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:52:45):\nDid you?\n\nLenny (00:52:45):\nYeah.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:52:47):\nThen, I would love to go watch the Britney Spears documentary, which is also part of the New York Times franchise, which is amazing. Or, I want to go listen to Kevin Roose and Casey Newton's Hard Fork podcast, which is wildly fun and just launched a couple weeks ago, if you haven't heard that. This is, I think, the future for us of being a connected family of products, where we can meet so many different needs that are first anchored in news, but then stretched into other facets of your lives. I don't really see other news organizations really operating at that scale and that ambition, and that's the future for us.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:53:24):\nWe really just think that the New York Times can mean so much more to so many more people. We're a journalism company, but we're building just tremendous software, and so the product ambitions are only getting bigger and bigger, and that's why I feel like I've got the luckiest job in the world right now.\n\nLenny (00:53:42):\nThat is a compelling vision. I feel like you can build your own metaverse in the New York Times where you just spend all of your days inside the New York Times' suite of products.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:53:52):\nCan I say though, there is a big difference. I think that for us our software actually helps people with real world outcomes in a very different way. We basically help you get access to information, decide how you're going to go to the ballot box. We give you information to go cook. Actually, there's something that I think is even more of a connection to the physical world, and it is very different from what the Metaverse is doing, but that's where we feel like we can drive as much impact as possible.\n\nLenny (00:54:20):\nYou can have your own competing metaverse. Here's a quick Wirecutter suggest idea for you, while we're chatting. I feel like Wirecutter, I use it all the time, everything I buy is based on Wirecutter recommendations, but I feel like there's an opportunity for design oriented version of Wirecutter. I don't know if anyone's thinking about that.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:54:37):\nTell me more.\n\nLenny (00:54:38):\nJust Wirecutter's functional stuff. It's like, \"Here's the best, I don't know, rice cooker.\" But like, what's the cutest but also the best? What's the cross section of looks good in my house and is the best. I'll be okay not the best best if it looks nicer, so a design lens to Wirecutter.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:54:54):\nIf it's Wirecutter meets high taste, basically. I like that. I like that. Okay.\n\nLenny (00:55:02):\nI think there's a market there.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:55:04):\nI'll definitely bring that back to the team. That's a good one.\n\nLenny (00:55:06):\nThere you go. Well, we've reached our very exciting lightning round where I'm just going to ask you, I have six questions, I'll get through them pretty quick. Whatever comes to mind, fire off. We'll go through it fast and fun. Sound good?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:55:21):\nGreat.\n\nLenny (00:55:21):\nOkay. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:55:27):\nI love Stripe Press, and so I think a lot of the books that they have",

What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:55:27):\nI love Stripe Press, and so I think a lot of the books that they have are just such good references, like Elad Gill's High Growth Handbook, or Will Larson's An Elegant Puzzle. Then, some of the more topical ones like Revolt of the Public. I just find that they're evergreen in terms of their utility. Anyone can find value in them. I just loved the craft of the books themselves. They are amazing products in terms of the content and the form, so those are, in the product context and work context, those are hands down I would say the places where I go first.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:56:01):\nBut I do think, and I know this is this humanities major in me, I also always try to balance books and my own reading time and recommendations with fiction. I just think it's actually like, sometimes some of the best ideas and inspiration come when you go one or two steps away from the core books that are related to your practice. Right now, I'm actually rereading Giovanni's Room by James Baldwin. It's just so beautiful and so lyrical and it gets at more components of the human soul that, I know it sounds crazy, but I find like those are little sparks of ideas that ultimately come back into making products, and particularly news products where they're so creative in the way that they tell stories.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:56:46):\nI always try to give people one pragmatic recommendation and then one slightly more field recommendation over in the world of fiction. If you haven't read Giovanni's Room, it is incredible and devastating, and I absolutely recommend it.\n\nLenny (00:57:00):\nWow. I feel like I just keep buying books after doing these podcasts. I have so many books I got to read. I'm also feeling like the combination of books you recommended is exactly what I would imagine someone leading product at New York Times would recommend, something product tactical and then just a beautiful piece of fiction.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:57:18):\nI'm the cliché. I love it.\n\nLenny (00:57:21):\nGreat. No, no, no. I wouldn't put it that way. Okay. What's a favorite other podcast that you like to listen to? You mentioned one already, is that the one?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:57:28):\nEveryone should listen to Hard Fork. It's great. But I just think The Daily continues to be, and again, I know it sounds self-serving, but being able to just listen to Michael Barbaro and Sabrina Tavernise once a day, just bring in journalists to talk and unpack a meaningful story, it's so visceral. I just find it to be one of the daily miracles that the New York Times is able to produce.\n\nLenny (00:57:51):\nYeah, that's wild. I can't imagine a daily thing like that doing that. Impressive. What's a recent favorite movie or TV show that you've seen that you've really enjoyed?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:58:01):\nI am pretty old school. I am actually rewatching The Wire for the third time.\n\nLenny (00:58:06):\nWow. That's a lot of time commitment.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:58:09):\nIt is. I have very little time, but every five years my husband and I, we just can't get over the characters, the storylines. It's just one of the best made series for television ever. It's a work of art, and so I am that person, that is another cliché, who is rewatching The Wire right now.\n\nLenny (00:58:27):\nWhat's your favorite season?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:58:28):\nI would probably say it's season three, but when Stringer Bell passes away, it's the culmination of just so much. I probably shouldn't say that for anyone who hasn't seen The Wire. Oh, that's like the worst thing ever.\n\nLenny (00:58:43):\nSpoiler alert in reverse.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:58:45):\nSpoiler alert. I'm so sorry.\n\nLenny (00:58:46):\nBut that's not the character name, that's the actor, right?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:58:49):\nNo, no, I really just totally spoiled that.\n\nLenny (00:58:51):\nOkay, that's cool. If you haven't seen it at this point, it's over, your loss.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:58:56):\nOh, boy. How awful. That's like a cardinals sin. But I do think season four, when it starts to get into the school system is also just, the actors are incredible. It's some of the best acting that I think has existed over the last couple of decades. Again, if you haven't seen it, please do yourself a favor and watch it. It's worth every episode.\n\nLenny (00:59:16):\nWould you agree season two is the worst?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:59:19):\nI thought that until I re-watched it.\n\nLenny (00:59:22):\nInteresting.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:59:22):\nI actually came around and it's not at the top of my list, but there's more to it than I think I originally gave it credit for.\n\nLenny (00:59:30):\nWow. I like this. Okay, great. What are four to five SaaS products that you or company uses most that",

What are four to five SaaS products that you or company uses most that you find really useful?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:59:39):\nProbably pretty classic, we use G-Suite, Slack, Figma, Mode, GitHub. Those are the ones that I think just get hands down the most amount of usage across our teams.\n\nLenny (00:59:51):\nThe fourth one was Mode?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:59:52):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:59:53):\nIs there any interesting new recent one that's like top of mind while we're on this topic?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:59:58):\nNot really. No.\n\nLenny (01:00:02):\nOkay, great. The winners keep winning, huh? These products?\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:00:07):\nYeah. If anything, it's like when you don't talk about the SaaS products you use, I feel like that's more of a success because it's just, it works behind the scenes, it blends in and it just makes everyone so much more productive.\n\nLenny (01:00:19):\nYeah. Imagine all these companies have the New York Times logo on their site of people using that.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:00:24):\nMaybe.\n\nLenny (01:00:24):\nThat would be a big deal when you guys adopt a product. Final question. Who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader and thinker?\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:00:32):\nThis is a hard question, but I would say one of the people who I find to just be a really tremendous product thinker, leader, and ally for women is Fidji Simo. I was lucky enough to work with her and for her when I was at Facebook and just watching the way that she ... what she did with Facebook, what she then is doing at Instacart and the way that she really just helps so many other women in the field figure out how to be better at their craft, how to have more opportunity. I don't know how she has these many hours in her day, but she's pretty incredible, so I would love to give a shout out to her.\n\nLenny (01:01:10):\nAwesome. I will try to get her on this podcast.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:01:13):\nOh, that would be amazing. All right. She's really-\n\nLenny (01:01:15):\nThat's what I need to do. Awesome. Good recommendation. Alex, this was amazing. I learned so much. This is such a fun conversation. Thank you, again, for doing this. Two last questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more? Maybe think about working at the New York Times and otherwise, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:01:32):\nThanks. You can find me on Twitter, LinkedIn, all the usual channels. I would love to hear from anyone and would be delighted to also talk about what it's like to do product at the Times. Then, the thing that would be really useful is what is the one feature that would make the New York Times more essential and more valuable to you in your daily life? I would love to hear from people on that front.\n\nLenny (01:01:53):\nAll right. I shared mine, a design-oriented Wirecutter. I will be looking for that.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:01:59):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (01:01:59):\nAwesome. Thank you, Alex.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:02:00):\nNo, of course. There's just one other whole theme, and I don't know if you want to chat through it, which is, what are some of the similarities and differences between product management in news organization?\n\nLenny (01:02:14):\nLet's do it.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:02:14):\nIt's totally up to you. But if that's something that you'd be interested in talking through.\n\nLenny (01:02:20):\nAbsolutely.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:02:21):\nI'm going to just focus on two themes that I think are pretty interesting. The first is just how we work at the New York Times, and we talked a little bit about working with journalism, and there are some really interesting differences. The second is just on the idea of impact. I think how the definition and the understanding of impact can be pretty different. First, just on the idea of how we work, there are a lot of similarities. I would say that product managers at the Times and at tech companies, they have a lot of the same skills. Like, we look for a great product sense, great execution, great leadership and drive.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:02:59):\nAny good PM needs to know their industry, their customers, their market, their business, et cetera. We actually do see a lot of crossover between product managers from tech companies who come to the New York Times or tech PMs at the Times who go over to tech companies. I think that that's wonderful, but a key difference of when you're a product manager working at the New York Times is that you work across the full stack of the product. Meaning, we own our journalism and our content. We own our distribution and we own our products. That's really different from working at a big tech",

I think that that's wonderful, but a key difference of when you're a product manager working at the New York Times is that you work across the full stack of the product. Meaning, we own our journalism and our content. We own our distribution and we own our products. That's really different from working at a big tech platform. When I was at Facebook, we controlled the software and the distribution, but we didn't control the content.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:03:39):\nWe had real limitations on understanding what was passing through. Was it high quality content, low quality content? It just led to, again, a lot of challenges that we already talked about. At the Times, when I think about how our best products are born, it's when you bring journalism and product lovers together. That means that PMs at the Times really need to understand the blend of art and science. They really need to value expert editorial judgment as they're also looking at individual KPIs, customer research and insights, et cetera. An interesting example, as I was trying to think about what would feel really different doing product at the Times compared to say Facebook is like, let's say you're at the product team and you're working on the home screen.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:04:25):\nWe always start with expert editorial judgment to curate the most important and interesting stories. But on top of that, we're training algorithms on specific data sets, like editorial important scores that actually come from our journalists. What that allows us to do is actually scale editorial judgment to a large group of readers. Those algorithms, what I think is just really great is they're trained on editorial signal and then they can still work towards driving towards outcomes like reach, engagement, conversion, et cetera. That's just such a different way of thinking. When I was at Facebook and we were focused on news ranking and feed, all we could do was train pieces of in information based on an engagement outcome.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:05:12):\nWe couldn't actually train it based on the quality of that piece of information itself. At the Times you get all, you have 2000 plus journalists and you're actually trying to structure their expertise into things that can actually translate into really great algorithmic decisioning, and that's just so different. No one else is really doing something in that space. Product managers are becoming very editorially minded and we're also getting editors to become more product minded. I just think that how we work there is so different and so unique. It's just a pretty fascinating part of, I think, how the sausage is made, if that makes sense.\n\nLenny (01:05:46):\nYeah. Thanks for sharing that. I think that's really important topic of just how it's different and why it's worth considering trying something like the New York Times as a place to work. What's interesting about what you're talking about, this also reminds me ironically of Substack, where they also are anti-algorithms and are also very focused on people and people recommending other people and just like individuals. I don't know if we want to get into this, but I guess do you have a opinion of Substack as a medium? Because folks leave New York Times to work on Substack, they come back. My whole living is on Substack. Any thoughts on the world of Substack?\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:06:25):\nWell, a couple of things. First, it's not that we're anti-algorithm on the New York Times front, it's just that we want our algorithms to reflect editorial judgment. That's really different. When it comes to Substack, actually, I think a lot of what Substack is doing is great. The idea of writers being able to make a living individually off of their craft, I think, is fantastic. The thing that I get excited about for Substack, but also for a company like the New York Times is trust right now with institutions has been declining, with governments, with religious institutions, with news organizations.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:07:00):\nBut trust with individual experts, where you have a real relationship, that really matters. That I think is one of the big unlocks in terms of helping the next generation of readers really start to create more of a relationship with high quality journalists and writers who have really important things to say about the world. I think whatever is happening in the world that helps great writers find their audiences, make a living, is wonderful. At the New York Times, a lot of what we're trying to do is, it's not the Substack model, but we have a lot more that we're doing to actually help get individual journalists out there.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:07:39):\nThey have their own subscribe only newsletters, podcasts. We're really trying to help them find a way to create a mini platform within the means and the scale of the New York Times. It's not quite the Substack model, but I do think that there's some interesting similarities, and the more that artists and creatives can help make a living, I think, it's just fantastic.\n\nLenny (01:08:00):\nI'm here for it. I love this two-part encore bonus we just did. Anything else that you want to share before we wrap up?\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:08:10):\nI think the only other thing that I have come to learn when you're doing product management at a news organization compared to a place like Facebook is just how different the definition of impact can be. When I was at Facebook, we were incredibly focused on scale, engagement, and revenue, which is very appropriate. At a company like the New York Times, we also have a huge ambition to grow our subscriber base. But one thing that's really",

When I was at Facebook, we were incredibly focused on scale, engagement, and revenue, which is very appropriate. At a company like the New York Times, we also have a huge ambition to grow our subscriber base. But one thing that's really interesting is that our impact and our business goals are in service of our mission, which is to seek the truth and help people understand the world, not the other way around.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:08:51):\nWhat it means is that the way that we think about impact is growing a giant subscription business. That business exists to strengthen an informed democracy at a time when people are struggling to understand basic facts and struggling to understand each other. That means that impact for us is growing subscribers, but it's also when a deeply reported story triggers an important policy change or a new law. When you're a product manager you're involved, again, in driving specific metrics like engagement or subscribers.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:09:26):\nBut you're also trying to help stories find their real audience in ways that trigger just this whole different side of mission and purpose driven impact. I didn't feel that when I was at a place like Facebook, but at the Times, I think it just gives product managers a bit of a broader aperture in the ways that they think about the relationship between business goals and mission impact goals, and it's pretty cool.\n\nLenny (01:09:50):\nIt does feel like it would be hard to find more meaningful, impactful work, and so that really resonates.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:09:57):\nOh, thanks. There are so many other important purposeful products and problems out there to solve in the world. We've talked about this, Lenny, but I just think that product managers and product thinking in so many contexts inside and outside of tech has never been more important in the world than right now. We need product managers everywhere diagnosing key problems and issues, coming up with radically novel solutions. This is the moment. It's really great to have your podcast and so many other resources out there to help new and other PMs just do their best craft. Thank you for having all of us in here.\n\nLenny (01:10:33):\nI love that as a closing thought. Alex, thank you again so much for doing this.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:10:37):\nThank you so much, Lenny. This was really fun.\n\nLenny (01:10:40):\nThank you so much for listening.

    "content": "Alex Komoroske (00:00:00):\nSo much of the way that we tackle problems and build products is this builder mindset. It's like I have a plan. I then manipulate things to match my plan and make it happen. And this is a way you can create tons of value. Part of the problem though is it can't possibly create more value than the effort that you put into it. What I look for instead are things that can be gardened, things that can grow on their own and that you can direct or maybe give a little bit of extra energy to or curate over, and is a totally different mindset for it. If you do this properly, it looks like magic. I've been told that this is completely against all the advice that people get, including products nowadays, but I think it's a very powerful approach that works in a lot of different contexts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):\nToday, my guest is Alex Komoroske. Alex is one of the most original, articulate, and first principle thinkers on the future of product and tech that I've ever come across. This conversation will get your brain buzzing in all kinds of ways. Alex spent 13 years at Google where he worked on Search, DoubleClick. He led Chrome's Open Web Platform team for eight years, led augmented reality within Google Maps, and developed a new toolkit to align company-wide strategy from the bottom up. After a stint at Stripe as head of corporate strategy, he's currently founding a startup that aims to reimagine the web for the AI era.\n\n(00:01:13):\nIn our wide-ranging conversation, we cover how LLMs and gen AI will impact how we build product in the coming years, what skills will matter most as AI becomes a bigger part of our lives, what companies can learn from slime mold, organizational kayfabe, the adjacent possible, strategy salons, why you should be thinking more like a gardener than a builder, plus a bunch of productivity tips, life advice, and so much more. This was such a fun episode, and I'm sure this is going to get your mind thinking in completely new ways.\n\n(00:01:42):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Alex Komoroske.\n\n(00:01:57):\nAlex, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:02:01):\nThanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:02):\nI love the way your brain works. My brain immediately starts buzzing anytime I start reading some of your stuff. And one of the more interesting things that you write and do and a really interesting habit you have is you actually have this doc that you keep called Bits and Bobs that I love, and we're going to be touching on a lot of the things that you share in this doc, Bits and Bobs, and we'll link to it. First of all, can you just explain this doc, Bits and Bobs, what's it about?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:02:27):\nYeah. I think it's like 600 pages now. It's this one Google Doc. Every so often, almost every day, someone will accidentally add a suggestion like add a space or something because it takes so long to load that while they're waiting, they'll tap on the screen and then it'll turn into taps on adding a comment or something. And I take a lot of notes. And people, I tell people when I'm in meetings with them of like, \"If you see me on my phone or typing, that means I think you said something very interesting and I'm writing it down. It's not that I'm just that I'm disengaged. I try to collect all these ideas.\" And then once a week, I go through, I take a few hours and I just reflect to myself and try to find patterns and unpack and find meaning and things. And I write those down and I started sometime in the past sharing those publicly, and it's now become a thing I literally can't stop doing.\n\n(00:03:17):\nI just find someone who was like, \"Oh, if you get more exposure for this, if you broke these up into tweets that you sent out once throughout the day,\" it's like, I did this for me. I'm happy to let other people see and peek into my weird mental process if they want, but this is 100% about my own self-reflection. And it's not designed. I don't want anyone to feel compelled to read it or... In fact, it's designed a little bit to be, I allow myself to be a little bit illegible. I want people to have to work a little bit with it. And it's not going to lay it out on a platter. It's going to jump between different things. I'll use terminology sometimes that is, what are you talking about? And I do that specifically. I don't want anyone to read and be like, \"Oh, it sucks. It wasn't worth my time.\" It's like, \"Cool.\" It's a 600-page Google Doc of my just unspooled insights. It's okay for you to not want to dive into that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:09):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo.

I have a thing called The Compendium, which is an open source tool. If you look at it currently, it looks like I haven't touched it in years, but that's actually incorrect. I built this about five years ago. I use it every day. And so I have, I think let's see, I currently have 17,248 unpublished working notes. And so what I do during the week is I'm taking notes very quickly in meetings, and then every day or two, I go through and I process them and put them in as working notes in The Compendium, and this is where I correct misspellings. I add just a little bit more context so that it will make sense to me if I were to read it in a year.\n\n(00:06:58):\nAnd also, I built a feature into it that uses embeddings to find similar cards. I find similar ideas from the past. And then what I do on Friday afternoons is I sit down and I go through all the notes I added that week and I just click and check the ones that still resonate with me, they still seem interesting in some way. And then I have a little export thing. I put it into a Google Doc, and while the kids are napping on the weekends, I just go through them and try to distill them a little bit more in a more long-term format. And then on Monday mornings, I publish them. And again, it's a deep... For me, it's like I can't imagine not doing this. It is the place where I find most of my most interesting insights is by reflecting on interesting conversations from the week before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:39):\nAs we get into the conversation, people get to see how deeply you think about stuff. Part of the reason you're able to think so deeply about stuff is you have this practice where you take time to reflect and share and crystallize. There's so much power in just forcing yourself to write it out, I imagine versus, just not.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:07:54):\n100%. I find that when you're busy, you're constantly just go, go, go, go. There's no time to do any deep thinking. Deep thinking takes time and space, and you got to create that space. The mundane, pointless bullshit will take every square inch you give it. So you got to make that space to sit back and reflect and luxuriate in these ideas. And when you do, you're often like, \"Oh my God. Oh wow, that's one I'll keep.\"\n\n(00:08:18):\nAnd I told people, back at the very beginning of my career, I used to work from home on Fridays. And people gave me so much shit for this and they'd say, \"Oh, you're working from home on Fridays.\" First of all, I will line up my output any day of the week. I'm very proud of the impact I've had. Second of all, Monday through Thursday, I'm in meetings from 8:00 to 6:00 or whatever. I'm just running between. I'm singing, pinging people and scheduling things and flinging action items. And the one day I don't take meetings is on Friday, and that's the day I read documents carefully that people had sent me or reflect. And I think to myself, what is the thing that if I had done it before the week started would've saved me tons of time and effort that week?\n\n(00:08:58):\nSo for example, maybe in 10 different one-on-ones with people on the team, I had to explain to them a strategic thing that we were doing or a change that we were",

And the idea and the way I framed it worked for everybody. Well, you know what? That should probably be a document, right? If the same idea worked for 10 different people and now in the future there's probably 10 other people that need to hear it, and now I'll write that document in 30 minutes and now I have it as a memorialized thing that other people can read on their own time without having to involve me.\n\n(00:09:24):\nAnd you also find these interesting ideas sometimes where you look at this problem that you're banging your head against, you go, \"Oh wait, if I will like that, that would've a wildly different dynamic.\" And you can only find those when you take a step back. And I find that people, I told someone, I mentored someone, I've mentored hundreds of PMs over the years and I told someone that at one point and they go, \"Oh, I wish I had the time.\" And it's like, you got to make the time. All of us are busy and we will always be busy. And so this to me is not something I do to just for the enjoyment of all. I do deeply enjoy it intrinsically. It's something I do because I think it makes me more productive and effective.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:01):\nI'm very tempted to go down a whole direction of just how you structure your time and your productivity calendar and all this stuff, but I'm not going to do that. That could be another episode if I do.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:10:09):\nI do for that for hours.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:10):\nWhat I want to do instead is pick on some of the Bits and Bobs that you've been focusing on noodling on that I think are going to be really helpful to listeners in how they think about product and the future of AI and all these things that I think are emerging. And the first one is actually that I want to get your thoughts on how AI and LLMs are likely to impact product development. A lot of the listeners of this podcast are PMs, engineers, founders, people building software, and you're spending a lot of time thinking about AI and product development. A lot of your Bits and Bobs have been just like, \"Here's what's happening. Holy shit. This is how things are going to be.\" So let me just ask you this how do you anticipate LLMs and gen AI are going to change how products are built in the next three to five years?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:10:56):\nI think they change a lot. I think LLMs are truly a disruptive technology. In fact, I would argue that what we're seeing in the industry is us trying to use mature playbooks from the end stage of the last tech era in one that doesn't really fit yet. To me, LLMs are magical duct tape. They're formed principally by the distilled intuition of all of society into a thing that operates between, a cost structure between human and plain old computing. So much of how the industry is built presupposes the idea that software is expensive to write and cheap to run, and LLMs undermine both of these. So it makes it LLMs allow writing shitty software to be significantly cheaper, not necessarily good software, but good enough in certain contexts. And also it means that there's certain software now that isn't plain old computing that can be run cheaply. It's relatively expensive marginal cost.\n\n(00:11:49):\nAnd so if you're going to do a consumer startup, it can't be based on advertising. It's just too expensive. Advertising cannot clear the inference costs even with inference costs declining. So I think the way to me, a disruptive technology changes tons of stuff, all these assumptions you didn't even realize you were making because you didn't realize it could be any different.\n\n(00:12:07):\nImagine if you were locked in a room for your entire career, no windows, and you have all these experiences. You're going all this know how. You're getting this sense of how things work, what will happen. And then imagine that room tilts on its axis by five degrees. Everything looks roughly the same, and yet now the dynamics of the force of gravity is pulling in a different direction than it was before. You didn't even think about the force of gravity before because it was so omnipresent. It never changed that it's just a blank in your head. And now gravity has changed effectively for your perspective and all kinds of intuition is now wrong. I put this thing on the table, it's going to stay there, and then it slides off and falls into the wall. All kinds of weird stuff will happen.\n\n(00:12:44):\nAnd I think LLMs to me feel like that. I can't tell you the number of people who are... At some point at a year or two, someone came to me, they're like, \"I just built a prototype, product that would've taken me three months. And I can believe it's going to start up.\" I was like, \"How differentiated do you think that is?\" Everybody can do that now. It changes the basis of competition. I think today I see a lot of folks using LLMs, and LLMs are like a squishy computer. We're used to computers",

I think today I see a lot of folks using LLMs, and LLMs are like a squishy computer. We're used to computers doing exactly what we told them to do, which is not necessarily what we meant. And only some people have learned the skill of programming, the arcane magical incantations to make computers do exactly what you meant.\n\n(00:13:24):\nNow, LLMs can do all kinds of stuff. And they don't do exactly what you told them, but they do typically do roughly what you meant. I see all these places where people will build products and they'll say 80% of the time, 90% percent of the time, it's great. 5% of the time it punches the user in the face and they're like, \"Oh, we're going to reduce the number of times it punches us in the face.\" It's like even if you get it down to 99% of the time, it's fine. If it punches in the face, that's not a viable product. And so how do you design your products assuming that this thing will be squishy and not fully accurate and fully work?\n\n(00:13:53):\nPeople use these things a lot as oracles. \"I'm going to have it. I'm going to formulate the answer and it's going to be a fully fledged answer.\" And of course, strawberry has been really stabbed at. Gotten a chance to play with it. They are getting better at some of these kinds of behaviors at great expense. But in a lot of cases, I instead would rather say, \"How can you take LLMs for granted? How can you assume that you now have this magical duct tape? Don't assume it's going to solve all your problems. Don't assume it's going to do autonomously be able to give high quality results of every case. But what can you now build now that you have magical duct tape?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:24):\nYou're a product manager for most of your career. Now, you're a founder. I'm curious what your advice would be to product managers and people building products in terms of what skills they should lean into, what you think is going to be matter most. There's hard skills. There's soft skills. There's getting more technical. There's getting more product business-oriented. Just what do you think people should work on more and becomes more valuable and what do you think becomes less valuable from a product builder perspective?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:14:52):\nI think in this early stage, we're in the community gardening phase, not the factory farming phase of this technology. And so I think what people need most is curiosity and play. You should be playing with these things and trying out different things and seeing what weird things are possible now. One of my favorite things, to be honest, right now, it's using AI is WebSim. WebSim is so weird. What a weird idea, like why? And then you play with it and you realize, \"Oh, this is a thing that could only exist in a world where LLMs exist.\" And I think these kinds of odd, interesting, weird, provocative, generative things will be where a lot of the interesting patterns are found because right now we're so used to... If the playbook, if the cost structures have changed, the kinds of things are now possible, the playbook is wrong and we should throw it out or at least ignore it to some degree. So it will feel like we are navigating through a whole new industry that it has in the past.\n\n(00:15:47):\nAnytime that an industry gets really, really, really, really, really good at like vertical SaaS, we know how to execute the crap out of that. We know exactly what to do. It doesn't require that much. It requires consumption and execution velocity and all this. But vertical SaaS, I think, is not the right model of how you would attack a problem that is an AI native style problem. And I think that those are where all the interesting things will be. And again, I think a lot of the tactics that we're trying out at the beginning, they won't work. It'll turn out that they only work 95% of the time, and 5% of the time they punch you in the face or something. And that means that you have to be more adaptable and you have to assume that a scrappy thing will be more important.\n\n(00:16:28):\nOne of the ways I put this is we've seen a vast reduction in the cost of distribution of information, and now we're seeing a reduction in the cost of information production. And most of it is slop. And so in this cacophony, how do you stand out? You stand out by having good taste. I think taste is the most important thing. You have a perspective that is different from the background noise, different from the average and that people find compelling. How do you find your own taste and how do you lean into that taste is, I think, much more important than just generically executing in the way that everybody else could do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:01):\nThere's so many threads I want to follow here, but maybe on just this last one, when you say taste, what do you mean by that? What should people think when they're like, \"Okay, I got to work in my taste\"?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:17:09):\nTaste, one way of looking",

What should people think when they're like, \"Okay, I got to work in my taste\"?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:17:09):\nTaste, one way of looking at this is differentiate from what the LLM would've written if given the same prompt. How different, how distinctive is what you have to say. And I think so much in large industry, in large organizations is about fitting into the role. How can you be a better and more efficient cog in that particular kind of machine? And I think in this new world, what you want to do is how can I become the best version of myself? How can I lean into the things that I have an interesting perspective on that make me different? Those are the kinds of things. And now of course, if you lean into something and you're doing something out there and nobody resonates with it, then it doesn't count. Good taste is something that is individual and also compelling to others. And so find what things you say that resonate with other people and lean into that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:53):\nI love that. Back to the WebSim example, we're going to link to this, but definitely play with WebSim. I was interviewing Dylan Field at Figma Config and this was his... Asked him like, \"What's the number one thing you think people are going to get more excited about in the future that you're playing with now?\" Because he's really good at identifying things that are going to be bigger in the future, and that was his choice. And it's very hard to understand exactly what it is if you just go there. But basically it's like you type a URL and it invents what that website is using just AI LLMs.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:18:22):\nThat's insane, as in. And you can get it to do, you realize as you play with it more, you can get it to do all kinds of specific things and you can steer it based on the way it uses the context of the last few pages. It creates a coherent world that's coherent with the things that you have recently seen, because you can steer it directly and you can watch fascinating people. They'll cover all kinds of wacky little techniques to get to generate, like generate a game for your kid that's on a specific type. You can do all kinds of stuff. And I'm not saying necessarily WebSim to me is a disruptive thing. Things that look alien and weird and yet are compelling, those are what we should be paying more attention to as opposed to take an existing playbook and slap something on it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):\nI love that. Another point that I saw you make about AI and the way it's different from other things we've done is most of the tools that we adopt in the workplace are collaborative where it helps your team be better, helps you collaborate better, and AI is the opposite. It makes you individually better. Can you talk about that insight?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:19:18):\n100%. I think this is one of the reasons is that the question right now of, okay, everyone's talking about AI and yet nobody's doing... There's no interesting breakout success obviously other than OpenAI and Anthropic obviously. So is there any value being created? I think it's entirely possible. And Ethan Malik who's a good friend, who has an amazing blog who's absolutely worth reading, has pointed out, too, that this is a thing that make individuals better in a way they might not want to tell their manager about. I can now do my job twice as fast. And if the organization sees that, they might go, \"Wait a second. We should pay you half this much.\" They're like, \"What if we get rid of some extra people or something?\"\n\n(00:19:56):\nAnd so if this stuff is magical duct tape, it's very hard to make scaled, repeatable, large scale things out of it. It's very easy to do rig the shit out of anything. And so you'll see it being used in the small in a way that's almost entirely below the level of awareness of the seeing at the organization. The organization almost won't see it or sense it, and yet it could be adding significant value or just being used quite heavily. And I think this is one of the things that makes it if everything is happening in the long tail of usage, then you could conclude, \"Oh, it's not being used for anything in the industry,\" but it's being used all over the place. I talked to Claude 20 times a day. I just have long conversations with it. I have tons of projects loaded up with all kinds of contexts on different topics, and I literally could not do the job I do now without having a conversation partner like Claude.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:48):\nLet me follow that thread real quick because a lot of people are like, \"Okay,\" people keep telling me, \"Play with AI. Use ChatGPT.\" Sometimes it's hard to see exactly what they can do with it. Can you give one example of how you found it really helpful or how you use Claude or another tool in your day-to-day?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:21:02):\nI use it to think through problems. And so like when I'm trying to name a concept or get a handle on a few different ways of looking at something, just saying, \"Here's what's in my brain about this topic right now. Here's some relevant context.\" I have a number of projects that just stuff as much of",

And so like when I'm trying to name a concept or get a handle on a few different ways of looking at something, just saying, \"Here's what's in my brain about this topic right now. Here's some relevant context.\" I have a number of projects that just stuff as much of the Bits and Bobs into the context as I can, which is very helpful. And I just say, \"Just play with it. Just give me 10 examples of that thing,\" or then, \"Critique these ones,\" or, \"It feels like this one's the best one for me. What works about this? Why is this one the best?\" Or, \"I want to work at an angle now that has something about know Helen Nissenbaum's concept of contextual integrity. How would I layer that in?\" It's just think of it as having a extremely well-read but slightly naive friend who is will never make you feel dumb and is willing to engage you in any particular topic you want to go down.\n\n(00:21:49):\nSo when you talk to an expert like a lawyer or a doctor or something, you know that that time is extremely valuable. You have a very small slice of time, and so there's tons of questions you don't even bother to ask. \"That's a dumb question. I'm not going to spend $1,000 to answer that question.\" Whereas if you can have that conversation, now this is not saying use it for legal advice, but it can allow you to explore through a problem domain and then later check it with experts and say, \"I believe this is a coherent outcome or a thing that should happen.\" And they can go, \"Oh yeah, that works.\" So I use LLMs to help me. It's like getting a, it's like an electric bike for idea spaces. You can just cover so much more ground so much more quickly in them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:26):\nI love that metaphor because it builds on Steve Jobs's that computers are a bicycle for the mind. And that's really a beautiful way of thinking about it, that LLMs are like the electric bicycle for the mind.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:22:37):\nI don't think if that's someone else's, the...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:38):\nOh, okay.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:22:39):\nI don't know where it came from. Part of my job is a collector of ideas, and so I try to put myself in the most interesting information streams with interesting people that I've found to have taste, have a perspective on something. Maybe I disagree with it, but they definitely have a coherent idea. And then I just allow myself to like, \"Oh, that's a really good idea and let me build on that or let me...\" I don't even know where that particular one came, but I'm 95% sure that somebody else said that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:05):\nI want to get to this idea of gardening versus building that is central to a lot of the way you think about it. But before we get there, I want to touch on another bit and bob that I love that you come back to occasionally, which is this idea of organizational kayfabe. Talk about what this idea of kayfabe is on its own and then how this applies to organizations in your experience.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:23:26):\nOne thing I should flag before I dive into any this stuff, sometimes when people hear me talk about how organizations work and systems, they think I'm being cynical. And I want to be very clear, I'm hyper-optimistic and I also believe that one of the moral precepts is how do you maximize the agency of real humans as ends in and of themselves? And so sometimes when I get excited about this, people go, \"Wow, that is so cynical.\" No, I'm just trying to describe the system as it actually exists. Once we know how it exists, we can figure out how to make it do great things and how we as members of this system can tweak and nudge it.\n\n(00:23:56):\nSo I just want to flag that before I dive into this. I have this slime mold deck which has gotten a ton of traction over the years, and part of the reason for that is because it feels like people tell me it feels like they think they're crazy and it feels like giving a big hug saying, \"You are not crazy. Here's why this thing shows up.\" And once you acknowledge it, it feels like a bummer to acknowledge it, but once you do, now there's all kinds of options that pop up. \"Oh, given that this thing is way more expensive than it looks, I can now do this instead. That one's 10 times cheaper. These two options, this one is way cheaper, way more likely to succeed.\" So once you see these forces, you see them more clearly.\n\n(00:24:28):\nSo kayfabe is I think a lens that's useful to understand how organizations actually work. Kayfabe is a word that comes, I believe is a carny word that is used and applied to professional wrestling and it means a thing that everybody knows is fake and yet everybody acts like is real. And I think it's one of the defining forces within an organization, any organization. So kayfabe in the small is optimism, enthusiasm. When someone says, \"We're going to do this thing,\" you say, \"Yeah, we're going to do that,\" even if I think this isn't going to work. If you say, \"I don't think this think",

And I think it's one of the defining forces within an organization, any organization. So kayfabe in the small is optimism, enthusiasm. When someone says, \"We're going to do this thing,\" you say, \"Yeah, we're going to do that,\" even if I think this isn't going to work. If you say, \"I don't think this think is going to work,\" everyone loses hope and it definitely doesn't work. So having a little bit of this is extremely valuable. It's the lubricant that allows organizations to believe they can do something and to attempt to do it.\n\n(00:25:09):\nThe problem that you get is as organizations get larger, imagine you are five levels down or something and you have this project you're working on and you're trying to give a status update to be rolled up to leadership. And it's currently a yellow, and your manager asks it and you know it's not going to be presented to leadership and enrolled up until next week. \"It's yellow, but I've got my arms around the problem. I know how to fix it. I'm going to go talk to Sarah. I think we have a solution. By the time this is reported up the chain, it's going to be green.\" So if I make it yellow, there's a non-trivial chance that someone's going to swoop down and say, \"Well, what's going on? We have a review,\" and it will be way harder to fix, so I'm just going to... A little white lie.\n\n(00:25:46):\nThis is a totally reasonable thing to do. It's a self-defensive thing to do. And it's probably the right thing for the organization too. The problem is this happens up multiple layers and it compounds. So then your layer above you does the same, and the same, and the same, and levels up you can be many orders of magnitude off of the ground truth. And so the kayfabe, the thing that everyone pretends to believe is true, is obviously incorrect. And the dangerous part about this is it can lead you to make very bad decisions. And if you as someone who sees this can see that wait a second, the official strategy is definitely not going to work, you're like, \"I got to tell somebody. We're doing work that's going in a bad direction. It's not going to work.\" And you go and say, \"I think that it's actually not going to work for these reasons.\"\n\n(00:26:27):\nAnd what someone will say to you, this happens by the way, I'm not substituting any particular organization, this happens literally in all organizations to some degree, is the senior person will say, \"Alex, I agree with you. It's not perfect, but if you hit the ground truth button, if you share that and everybody, the whole thing will shatter and we can't do anything. And so help me fix it. Don't say the ground truth. Just help nudge it and fix it.\" That's a good point. Okay, so you help working on it and then you realize a month later, wait a second, it's getting worse. We're doing things that's not good for the company. It's not creating user value. It's not good for the employees. They're burning out. It's just not good for anybody and it's getting worse. And so if you think you're going to go and hit the ground truth button, before you do, you'll be flying tackled to the ground by somebody and stabbed in the dark because you will destroy everything.\n\n(00:27:13):\nAnd so it becomes correct to hold onto this idea of if you acknowledge the kayfabe is false, then you are in danger of getting knocked out of the game. And so how do you do good things despite the fact that you're pulled in two different directions? And this increasingly in the limit, it can be good to a point where the easiest way is if I do, if I hold on this idea, we might create significant value for the company. If I let go of this idea, I die. So the easiest way to maintain this split-brain thing is to just turn this part off and just earnestly believe the kayfabe. This has been organizations become zombies, and anyone individually you talk to behind the scenes will agree yes, it could not possibly work. That turns out that these things work this way, and yet the entire organization lumbers on.\n\n(00:27:56):\nAnd this is a death state for large organizations. It happens all over the place in any number of different conditions, and this is one of the reasons it shows up. And I think acknowledging that is an important way to help navigate and still make good grounded things happen. How can you allow disconfirming evidence to show up that doesn't kill you, that helps make you stronger? And if it all has to come in one massive moment that could ruin everything, then you aren't going to hear it. And then it will build up and build up and build up and build up into a super critical state that could shatter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:27):\nI was just listening to a couple podcasts, and a thread that came up in a number of them is some of the most successful leaders, their instruction to their reports is, \"As soon as there's bad news, I need to know as soon as possible. Do not shield me. I just want to know all the bad news as soon as possible.\" Feels like that's one solution to what you're describing.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:28:44):\nDisconfirming evidence hurts, and so you won't realize it because it hurts at any given moment. It's like, \"Ugh, it's a distraction. We're just trying to get this thing done.\" And so it comes",

It's like, \"Ugh, it's a distraction. We're just trying to get this thing done.\" And so it comes from a good place to not get it, but if you're busy, that's one of the reason you need to take a step back. We take a step back, you're a little bit calmer. You can absorb this as confirming evidence. It doesn't feel like an existential threat. It's really easy to get surrounded. If you are very powerful, you will find all the confirming evidence you need. And if it doesn't exist, it will be created for you without your knowledge.\n\n(00:29:12):\nAnd so this is one of the reasons that large companies are radically different than smaller companies. And one of the traps that you can get into of not realizing this dynamic is happening, and you can make very bad decisions if you don't understand that it's inherently what's happening because they're all, \"Oh, we'll have some bad actors.\" No, no, no. If people don't play this game, this game is emergent. It shows up even though everybody hates it. And if you don't play the game, you are knocked out of the game. The underlying dynamic that must be true in any organization on a fundamental basis is you can't make your boss look dumb because if you do, they're the person who decides, \"Oh, this person's not performing,\" or whatever. And that one little asymmetry, that one little fact, in most cases it does not matter. That one little asymmetry is what leads to the systemic compounding thing where you get these really weird dysfunctional emergent things that everybody hates, nobody wants, and yet nobody is in the position to change per se.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:05):\nI love your caveat at the beginning that continues to resonate in my head as you say this. You're not cynical about, \"This sucks.\" It's more, \"Here's what I'm observing. We need to think about ways to get around this.\"\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:30:16):\nYeah. Because I think so much pain and misery is caused by us being not acknowledging these fundamental, inescapable things. It's almost impossible. Entropy is one of those things. Entropy emerges because there's more ways to go away from a point than towards a point. It fundamentally must be true in really any universe you can possibly imagine. And so if you're going to fight entropy, you're going to lose at a certain point. It's like if you are aware of these things, you can find subsets of ideas that do work despite these challenges. And that's some of the stuff, the tactics I advise are often things that look playful. They look unserious. They look like, \"Oh, you're saying you don't know the answer?\" No, I'm admitting I don't know the answer.\n\n(00:30:55):\nAnd I'm saying it doesn't matter if I don't know the answer because this thing, this very small seed I am planting is so cheap that yes, I can't tell you for sure this will work, but I could tell you there is a chance that it'll work. And the downside of this is basically the opportunity cost of planting the seed in this one moment, and the person who's planting it enjoys planting it so that an opportunity cost really isn't that much because they get energy from doing it. So who cares? Plant a bunch of these suckers. If one of these grows into an oak tree, that's great. Don't try to analyze beforehand which seed is going to turn into an oak tree. If it's super simple to plant the seeds, then plant the seeds. And if it starts growing, then keep watering it. That's it. That's the thing.\n\n(00:31:30):\nAnd people sometimes will see this as like, I've been called in my list before because they said, \"Well, you're saying that you don't know the answer to the thing.\" It's like no, I'm saying I don't have to know the answer to the thing. If on a systemic basis I let these ideas and then you respond to the ones that are working that are viable, it doesn't really matter if you didn't know ahead of time which ones were going to work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):\nIt's a great segue to talking about this core idea that again informs a lot of the way you think, which is this idea of building versus gardening, the magic of acorns. Talk about this general idea and then I want to follow some threads.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:32:02):\nSo much of the way that we tackle problems and build products is this builder mindset. It's like, \"I have a plan, I then manipulate things to match my plan and make it happen.\" And this is a way you can create tons of value. Part of the problem though is it can't possibly create more value than the effort that you put into it. And so what I look for instead are things that can be gardened, things that can grow on their own and that you can direct or maybe give a little bit of extra energy to or curate over, and is a totally different mindset for it. So it's like a lead by gardening vibe. I don't try to pick the things in the system. I try to work with what I've actually got and I try to lean in on the ones that turn, I think are going in the direction that I believe is valuable based on constantly seeking disconfirming evidence.\n\n(00:32:44):\nAnd if you do this properly, it looks",

It looks like a thing. It looks like getting lucky because what you're doing is you're farming for miracles. And so on a systemic basis, I can't tell you which of these things will work, but I can tell you there's a very high likelihood that one of these will work in a way that is interesting and transformative. And so if you're looking and finding these seeds that have the compounding potential of if they work, they would start working at an accelerating rate, then you don't have to know ahead of time. To me this is, I've been told that this is completely against all the advice that people get building products nowadays, but I think it's a very powerful approach that works in a lot of different contexts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:26):\nIs there an example that you can give from either from something you worked on or something someone worked on that came or true miss? Because I think people hearing this might be like, \"But I got to ship stuff. I got to hit some goals. I don't have time to sit around and garden and plant seeds. I got to actually build.\"\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:33:41):\nIf there's an ecosystem approach, if there's something that if it works, it'll be self-accelerating. So okay, what you're going to do this thing, we aren't entirely sure what's going to work, but if a developer writes a thing and somebody uses it, it'll attract more developers, more users, and then this would grow on its own. Then and it's cheap to do the little example of the thing. It's cheap to build a little open source, tinker the little thing and just put it there. And if nobody uses it, it's fine. It was fun to build. It took you three hours. It's fine. If someone does use it, then you just invest in incremental bit of unit each time that you find a signal that somebody is finding it useful and then you stop if you ever cease getting that information.\n\n(00:34:16):\nSo I would use this. Anything that is shaped like an ecosystem that has some kind of network effect, and many things have network effects, have some kind of compounding loop. Compounding loops are not rare. They are, \"Look.\" It's like truffle hunting. You have to know what you're looking for and find the dynamics of a thing that if it worked would work at an accelerating rate. Lots and lots and lots of things intrinsically have this shape. Anything with a network effect, anything where the power goes up with a number of users, but it shows up in all kinds of problems that we don't normally apply it to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:47):\nAlong the same lines, you also advise people to think more emergence-oriented versus top-down, kind of what you were just saying. But I think that's another really interesting way of thinking about the same idea, create opportunities for emergence, bottom-up versus top-down control. You just chat about that.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:35:03):\n100%. I think the emergence is one of the most powerful forces if you know how to marshal it and you know how to work with it. And the only thing that's hard about it in my opinion is you're going to look like you aren't very serious. You're going to look like a weirdo. You're going to look like a cook. And one of the downsides, if you're working on something and you're doing the normal top-down approach where you make the plan, you execute the plan, even if the plan turns out to not be useful, you produce a thing and nothing interesting happens, no one can say you didn't work hard. But if you try doing this designing for emergence and something amazing happens, even once it happens, people go, \"Ah, it's luck. Where was the miraculous moment, the heroic moment where you made that happen? So therefore you had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n(00:35:42):\nAnd this was the biggest unlock in my career actually was when I stopped my guts. I was promoted to director at Google. I was like, \"Cool, I never want to be promoted inside of a large organization ever again.\" And the freedom to now do the highest impact work, even if I can't make it legible to the organization, was so powerful and I was able to 10X my impact for the organization because I didn't have to worry about making it measurable specifically in a way that would show individual work effort. And I think that's the hardest part. And you have to have, typically what I would advise for PMs, my approach at Google was 70% of my effort and my team's effort should go on things that everybody acknowledges are important and useful and create value. Maybe it's boring, linear value, but some kind of value. You're trying to minimize the chance that any other person in a company will say, \"What does that team do anyway?\"\n\n(00:36:32):\nThis, if someone says this about your team, your team is on the verge of death. And so you're trying to minimize the chance that anybody wants to say that or thinks that it's appropriate to say that by clearly and unambiguously adding value. You're not saying this is the best team in the entire world, but clearly they're doing something useful. They're executing well. They're working hard. And of course that",

    "content": "will say, \"What does that team do anyway?\"\n\n(00:36:32):\nThis, if someone says this about your team, your team is on the verge of death. And so you're trying to minimize the chance that anybody wants to say that or thinks that it's appropriate to say that by clearly and unambiguously adding value. You're not saying this is the best team in the entire world, but clearly they're doing something useful. They're executing well. They're working hard. And of course that team should exist. Think about it, of course they should. But now once you do this, you have 30% of your extra time that you can plant all these seeds.\n\n(00:36:55):\nYou can find interesting little things where maybe a junior PM on the team has an idea you think it's kind of silly, but they're really into it. And the there is this thing, it could work out great actually. If you tweak it like this, there is a potential. I could see how that could work. If that PM is going to work on that anyway, they want to do it anyway. Instead of saying, \"No, no, no, we don't have time for that. Be a little bit more productive over here,\" say, \"Go for it. Here's my concerns. I imagine this part might not work, but this part is really cool right here.\" And then if it doesn't work, then they've stretched their agency. They've executed. They've exercised their agency. They've learned. They've gotten stronger. They've grown. It has the upside if it turns out to actually work. And worst case scenario, the opportunity cost to doing the thing that helped them grow and they learn and they liked. So I don't know. Don't try to force it. Don't try to stop it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:40):\nThat's a really good example of actually how to go about doing that on your team. The way I've always thought about this is the visual I share with people is like, you want to create cover fire for your team where your team's just hitting goals, moving metrics, and then while with that cover fire, you're building the doomsday bomb inside, protected where no one's going to come and stop you.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:37:58):\nYeah, because one of the hardest parts about an acorn when you plant it is making sure a squirrel doesn't dig that fucker up. There's so many things that can destroy it, and just keeping it, allowing it some space and allowing it some time is the most important thing. And it's challenging to do, but that's why it's important as a leader to have enough credibility in the organization that people can see that you are doing useful work to give you the space, to give your team the space to do this truly great work. If you want to get your team to do good work, there's a million different paths to do that. If you want to get your team to do great work, there's no shortcut other than to have an extremely high-trust environment where people lean into their superpowers in a way that adds up to something greater than some of its parts. That takes time. It takes effort. It's very difficult to make legible up to the rest of the organization, but that is where great things come from.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:46):\nIt reminds me of something Ed Catmull shared in Creativity, Inc., this idea of the ugly baby, that every new idea is an ugly baby and nobody wants this ugly baby. Everyone's just like, \"Get this out of here,\" because every new idea is bad initially.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:39:00):\nYeah, it sucks. They're just like this ugly thing that barely works or... But this is why what I try to do is I try to see the greatness, the seeds of greatness in everything. Everyone and everything around me, I look for, I try to find and see, man, what is the most compelling part of this? And let me lean into that. And so one of the things I try to do when I meet with people, when I mentor them, I try with it within the first session or two, whenever I can get a hypothesis, I say, \"I think your superpower is...\" And I describe to them what I think I can see them being truly exceptional at.\n\n(00:39:31):\nAnd sometimes I get it wrong, especially if I try to do it earlier, but when people feel very seen and they feel acknowledged for that, they now are willing, they're going to stretch farther and they're going to respond to nudging feedback even better because they know that you're not trying to tell them be different. You're trying to tell them be more, and you now the nudges will feel less like a stop energy and more like someone who gets me and can help me grow even more. And you can get some amazing things out of people when you just treat them with the respect. I assume that everyone I talk to, everyone I talk to is interesting, has seeds of greatness in them, even if they don't recognize necessarily where they are.\n\n(00:40:08):\nSomeone described to me actually this morning in one of my little dirt clubs I run about they help facilitate about treat everybody like the Buddha. I think is I'm messing this up, but this notion of imagine everyone you talk to is the Buddha, in a Buddhist mindset, and how do you see and find those seeds of greatness and treat everyone with respect intrinsically as an end of themselves. This is one of those things that you do to be a compassionate human. It's also, I believe, a way to maximize the amount of value, direct and indirect value, that's created. So it's one of those win-win-win-win-wins where just it's the right thing to do as a person",

So interestingly enough, the first time I heard about you and what got me interested in your stuff is I did a newsletter post with the company Perplexity about how they build product. And as they were describing how they organized their team, the co-founders described they organized like slime mold, and he linked to your deck about slime molds and I was like, \"What the heck is this?\" Can you just briefly describe what you mean when you talk about slime molds and how slime molds are related to the way companies are organized and how they should think of the organization?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:42:32):\nYeah. The main thesis of the slime mold deck is that the core dynamic that makes organizations hard to navigate as they get larger, even if you assume everyone is actively good at what they do, actively collaborative and actively hardworking, is this emergent force or coordination of finding the subset of projects to work on when everyone's super busy that everyone agrees and commits to and actually works on together. And finding this coordination cost grows with the square of the number of people who are working on that thing. And so what companies typically try to do is fight this or ignore that it exists.\n\n(00:43:06):\nIf you're going to fight it, the one way to look at this is think of a company like a vehicle. When the company is very small, you can drive it, you can steer it like a sports car. As a founder, you are allowed to steer. Everyone acknowledges you are allowed to steer. They're never, \"Why is he steering it that way?\" So you, a founder, can help navigate an organization around an obstacle the organization cannot see or comprehend itself. The problem is as you steer, as you grow into the size, your organization goes from a sports car and you grow into the size of a big rig, if you drive a big rig like a sports car, you're going to be a danger to yourself and others on the road and you're going to grind the engine. And so you got to drive the car that you actually have.\n\n(00:43:41):\nSo what I see a lot of things happen in large organizations, that people are just trying to ignore this fact. And when you drive, by the way, a car, your vehicle, like a big rig, when it is a big rig, people go, \"Oh, it means to go slow.\" No, no, no. It means pivot less. It means have a little bit more... Be more intentional about the times that you adjust the steering, invest more in program management, invest more in processes, give a little bit more slack in the planning process to absorb any kind of surprising things that you can still all reach the product launch at the same time.\n\n(00:44:13):\nThe other option you can do is you can split your thing up into a series a swarm of sports cars, individual sports cars. And the downside of this, you'll get the autonomy and strengths of the bottom-up, the downside is other people will externally will look at it and go, \"Well, that team and that team clearly didn't talk.\" You'll say, \"Yep, yep.\" You have to decide how bad that is for you. Apple has chosen the former. It's very important to them to have the illusion of perfect coherence in their products. It worked very well for them. They executed marvelously. And if you also picked the exact opposite thing, everyone else is like, \"Yeah. There are like 15 different ways of doing everything. They clearly don't talk to each other.\" But it allows the overall swarm of the AWS product suite to be very powerful and anti-fragile or whatever you want to say.\n\n(00:44:52):\nAnd so slime molds, I think, is acknowledging that organizations are, especially ones that focus on autonomy and agency of their individual employees, which is a lot of tech companies, they are more like slime molds than we",

And if you fight that fact, you're going to have a bad time. And if you embrace it, then you can start realizing slime molds are actually kind of amazing. They can find solutions to problems you didn't even know you were searching for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:15):\nAlex, you have the best metaphors. I don't know how you do this, but they're so evocative and correct.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:45:21):\nI can tell you that the process I do if you're into it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:23):\nPlease. That would be incredible.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:45:25):\nI think by talking, I'm an external processor, I literally can't think if I'm not talking. And so I make sure I have as many interesting meetings as I can, and that's where I discover what I think, by talking to people. And the test is if I say a frame, something that the person goes, \"Ooh,\" or like, \"Ooh,\" they go, \"Aha,\" that's a win. That's a mark that's a good one. You're just randomly casting about. I find one. And then if a different person also has a similar response, if a person in sales and a person in engineering both find the same idea interesting, that's a very good sign that lots of people will find it interesting, how diverse in terms of background skill sets, perspectives are the people who resonate with the thing you're saying.\n\n(00:46:08):\nThe intuition of this is if you find in a social network, you want to see what's going to go viral, if something is shared and it's shared within, so the people who are at the beginning are all highly densely interconnected in the social graph, then the implied ceiling is relatively small. You only know it works with that audience. But if it's people that are very different subclass and very little overlap, they both find it interesting, that implies a much larger max audience. So you're looking for ideas that resonate with the diversity of people. And then once you find them, each time you get something like that, you invest a little more time in it and you think a little bit more about framing it the next time.\n\n(00:46:42):\nI haven't done this during this chat, but in most conversations, you'll see me as I'm talking writing down stuff like, \"Ooh, that was the best formulation of that one so far.\" And so you keep on coming back to it. You keep on tightening it and seeing how, watching how it's responding and referring with different people through like, \"Where do you get these from?\" It's like I got thousands and thousands and thousands of little examples or metaphors or whatever that's sick.\n\n(00:47:03):\nOne of the benefits of metaphorical thinking is you connect nine of the 10 dots and you invite the listener to engage with the argument to connect that last dot. This allows you by the way to say very controversial things, because if you say connect all the 10 dots and it's like, \"Oh, that's the official strategy,\" then you are instantly a dangerous thing. Whereas if you leave one dot unconnected, people can go connect the dot and go, \"Oh my god, I think that applies to us.\" You're like, \"Oh my god, what?\" \"Yes, that's why I picked that.\" But to counteract this because now it's less obvious to people that's correct, you have to make the metaphor evocative and interesting.\n\n(00:47:39):\nOne of the reasons that slime mold deck got so much traction is partially because slime is gross, it's bad, and yet it's talking about why slime is good. And so that has this instantly subversive thing. I only know this after the fact of trying to figure out why did that deck get so much attention of all the things I've written.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:56):\nIt also is all emojis basically, which is not how you often read a deck. It's very beautifully made. I love that you've been talking about the way you think and come up with ideas is by talking to people and having conversations. We also talked about how you write in this Bits and Bobs approach. I asked someone that you worked with at Stripe what to ask you, and she said to ask you about strategy salons, which feels like a good avenue for this sort of thing. Can you talk about what these are and how you set these up?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:48:26):\nSo these I also call now nerd clubs, and these are my secret weapon. And I have a blog post. I started writing right before my second kid was born, and then he was born three weeks early and I just lost the plot and now it's like a 40-page draft of a thing that I'll probably never finish. But I've used this tactic. I discovered it many years ago as they strengthen some of the techniques I'd used in open source community organizing. And the situation was I was just joining a new team at Google. I've been there for many years, and there was at the time 12 different groups working in different aspects of this overall problem domain. And in classic Google fashion, they added up to significantly less than the sum of their parts, as in not like, \"Oh",

I've been there for many years, and there was at the time 12 different groups working in different aspects of this overall problem domain. And in classic Google fashion, they added up to significantly less than the sum of their parts, as in not like, \"Oh, we'll see which one works,\" but, \"These two things directly undermine each other. If you execute both of these strategies, neither can work.\" And I knew that if you try to do pairwise executive reviews on this very complex, ambiguous, open-ended problem, you would get really expensive pageantry that would obscure more than clarified.\n\n(00:49:17):\nSo what I did was I created a secret group that I called Navel Gazers was the original one, and I wanted people when they hear about it, I want people to go, \"That will be a club for nerds.\" They're like, \"Yeah, do you want in?\" And so this means that only people who intrinsically want to be in it for its own sake come in. So you get only a positive \"yes, and\" kind of energy. So then within these groups, you say, you set the norms very explicitly and say, \"This is a collaborative debate environment. This is only 'yes, and'.\" If somebody says a thing in this group that is optional and secret and completely off the side of anything that matters, if they say something that you think is an actively dumb idea, you are free to not engage. Just leave it. That's fine. Because nothing's going to happen. We're deciding anything interesting or important here.\n\n(00:49:57):\nAnd if you want to engage and you don't like it, a productive way of doing that is saying, \"Oh, that's so interesting. I would never would've thought to apply that lens. I typically would apply this lens to that kind of problem. I wonder if that applies here.\" And by saying, \"I wonder,\" you make it about you, not them. And so that person can choose if that's an interesting thing to build on or not. This sounds by the way very non-rigorous feel like, \"Ah, how can you possibly get rigorous thinking in the 'yes, and'?\" It turns out there's limited amounts of time and so people will choose to build on the things they find most interesting. This is interesting things are surprising and potentially valuable. And so if lots of different people in the group are building on the same idea, that's a good sign there is something very interesting going on.\n\n(00:50:35):\nThe third thing you do is you dribble in new perspectives. Every one to three a week, if you put in lots of new perspectives, once the norms can all scramble, if you have one in five people who all have a very particular kind of personality can mess up the norms, and so you're trying to minimize the chance you add a jerk. It takes one person to poop a party and go, \"What are we even doing here?\" You want to minimize the chance that happens. But second or thirdly and more importantly, you want to have as people with as different perspective as possible added into the group. And so this is what Ken Stanley might call, for example, novelty search. You're novelty-searching through the different perspectives in the overall thing.\n\n(00:51:10):\nWhen you do this properly, you get something magical. You get a group that people find intrinsically valuable for its own sake and just enjoy participating in and find meaning in, that also stochastically spins off changing insights for the surrounding context because you're searching through these ideas in a low stakes environment where the ideas that lots people build on, they go, \"Oh, you should write that down.\" And this is like an idea lab, what everyone will call an idea lab. And this creates amazingly interesting insights. You just can't force it to do anything. It has to be a bottom-up and emergent, which means if you try to steer it towards an outcome, it won't go. But if you do these, they are amazing places to riff and to share ideas and half-formed ideas. And this is anywhere I go, I terraform the culture around me and create these, because I need it as a place to experiment and try out different half-formed ideas and build on them and be inspired by other people.\n\n(00:52:03):\nAnd that is one of my secrets, strategy secrets that I've been doing now for probably 10 years ago is when the first one started. And there's now I can count eight or nine of I've started over the years. Some of them emerged. So many of them are still at Google. And I think it's like they're just wondrous environments that I think create a lot of value.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:21):\nAnd I love it's a perfect example of your approach of emergent properties, letting things emerge versus a top-down, \"Here's what we're doing and here's what we're talking about here.\" If someone wanted to set this up within their company or within friends, any advice? What are some constraints and ways of setting it up for success?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:52:37):\nCommunities are all about momentum. You want to have a space too small, a time too short. If you have a big cabinet space of a lot of people in it and no one's talking, people go, \"I guess this is the place where we don't talk,\" for whatever reason. So what you're doing is you want the smallest seed of people that you know are going to be actively engaged. So maybe there's four of you that already",

So what you're doing is you want the smallest seed of people that you know are going to be actively engaged. So maybe there's four of you that already talk over lunch and you talk about whatever topic and it's always really interesting and generative. Cool, get that group together and do a thing. And then incrementally add people who you think are going to like that already as it currently exists. And then you need to feed it so you want to make sure that it never dies.\n\n(00:53:09):\nAnd a community with no people talking is definitely dead. A community with one person talking is already dead. You don't realize it yet. And so you're trying to maximize the chance that there's an interesting conversation even when you as the facilitator are not there. This takes some active policing by the... Like a garden has a gardener, there's somebody pruning back and saying, \"Hey Jeff, just so you know, I think that came out a little bit strong to Sarah's idea and maybe next time add 'I wonder' to the front of that statement,\" or whatever.\n\n(00:53:35):\nThe other thing that you do is when people reach out to you and ping you, they go, \"Hey, let's think about this thing,\" and you go, \"That's a really interesting idea. You should share that in the group.\" And then they do. And then you engage in the group and say, \"That was really interesting,\" little emoji response. And people who didn't watch the interaction assume that Sarah just decided proactively to stick her neck out and share that and that it worked. And so this becomes a self-sustaining norm in the community. And it's not a secret. It's not if someone asks, \"Yeah, I told Sarah to share that,\" but people watching don't realize that. And so it becomes a place that people do take risks and feel comfortable sharing.\n\n(00:54:07):\nThe other thing you do is once a week or so, you want to make sure that you never propose something in the group that people go, \"Eh.\" You always want to do a thing people go, \"Yeah.\" So what you do is you see that if you're talking to other people, you say, \"I wonder if we should have a live conversation every so often, right?\" The chats were so fun, but it goes, \"Would you come if I did one?\" \"Oh yeah, I would.\" \"Okay, great.\" So now I say, \"Hey, a few of us are talking. We're just going to do an experiment. We're going to have an hour-long conversation over lunch on Wednesday. Anyone in the group is free to come.\"\n\n(00:54:33):\n And then what you do is you make sure it always has quorum because if it doesn't have quorum, then the thing, it looks like the community's dead. And then what you do is you send FOMO stuff afterwards. So you say, \"Here's my notes from the thing,\" or, \"Thanks Sarah, Jeff,\" blah, blah, blah, blah, \"or an amazing conversation. I thought the insight about,\" blah blah blah, \"was so ridiculously amazing.\" So you want people who were in the group who didn't come to feel like they missed out and to come to the next one.\n\n(00:54:57):\nAnd so you're constantly creating these kinds of vibes to how to do it. You can't do it if you don't have somebody with a lot of energy. I'm typically the seed crystal for a lot of the groups I'm in to start them off because I have a lot of energy, and I like, anything that people have to say that I think is open-minded or interesting, I like building on and \"yes, and\"-ing and that kind of gives the foundation that it can grow. But look for the people who already roughly want it. Don't try to convince somebody who doesn't want it to want it. They will not. They will ruin the whole thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:30):\nI just love this playbook for starting to build a little bit of community within a company. Have you written about this by the way? And if not, you should write a whole post about this.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:55:37):\nI have. It's a long essay and it's just not, you can see it in Bits and Bobs. If you gave the Bits and Bobs to Claude and said, \"Please write a thing about nerd clubs and essay and the style,\" it would do it because there's a lot of the pieces are in there, it's just not factored out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:52):\nI see you writing something down right now, which tells me you just articulated something in a new way that you want to say.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:55:52):\nYeah, that's right. That's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:59):\nYou mentioned this idea of constraints of time, and it reminds me of something that you shared in one of your Bits and Bobs around productivity. You say that if you have two hours to do a five-minute task, the effort to do that is impossible and instead you should flip that. Can you talk about this insight and how to be a little more productive?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:56:15):\nYeah, I think a lot of the trick to productivity is to play yourself like a fiddle and figure out how you work and what gives you",

You say that if you have two hours to do a five-minute task, the effort to do that is impossible and instead you should flip that. Can you talk about this insight and how to be a little more productive?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:56:15):\nYeah, I think a lot of the trick to productivity is to play yourself like a fiddle and figure out how you work and what gives you energy and set up your day to structure it that way. So I find every time you start a task, there's an activation energy, especially a task you don't really want to do. And then when you complete it, there's a boop. There's a little burst of energy. So if you do this properly, you can get small things that are extremely easy to knock out in 10 seconds of effort, and then you do one that takes 30 seconds of effort, and then you do one that takes a longer bit of effort. But if you give it too much space, it's harder to do. So you almost want to find, \"Okay, listen, I got 10 minutes. I got to do this thing where I figure out how to add, do this thing in gusto that I've been putting off. Ten minutes should be enough time to do it and structure it. So okay, right now is the only time I have to do this, to do it.\"\n\n(00:57:01):\nAnd another trick is I use one of my original media messages actually, one of the original public ones is about always rules are better than sometimes rules for self-control. And so if you're going to diet, \"I'm going to skip lunch every day.\" Like holy, you haven't full thought on that at some point like a day with a big executive review, \"I really need to make sure I'm well-fed before I go into this review,\" or something. And now you've broken the streak and now it's over. Whereas if you say a thing you know can do, \"I will not have a dessert unless it would be socially awkward for me to not eat it. For example, in a small environment where somebody made homemade dessert and all of us are eating it, I'm going to...\" So very clear black and white rule that you can hold on forever.\n\n(00:57:50):\nSo for example, since the pandemic started, I've done a Peloton workout every single day since the pandemic started.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:56):\nWow.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:57:56):\nAnd now once I do start going back into the office, if I had to commute into the office, I would sometimes do a meditation to check the box for that. But if I'm not commuting and I'm not deathly sick, I've done a full workout since then. And the idea each day of is today the day of all the hundreds of days in this streak that is the worst or the hardest for me to do this thing? Is this the day? No, of course it's not. I will do it. And so that keeps you in this streak that makes it harder and harder to get out of it. And in some ways, of course you can torture yourself in an unproductive way like at a certain point maybe you should stop that streak, but I think those kinds of structuring help you get the things done you want to get done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:38):\nIt's like the Seinfeld trick of productivity where you just keep track of how many days in where you've done something essentially.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:58:45):\nYeah, exactly. And I think people don't give those kinds of tactics enough credit because there's lots of little social tricks to yourself and others. This is when you have other people who are depending on you for something and will know that you didn't do the thing, that were so much better. So just little tricks like this help you be wildly more productive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:02):\nActually, I want to go back a little bit. I'm curious what you wrote down when we were chatting earlier that you thought was a good articulation if you're able to share, if it's interesting,\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:59:11):\nI wrote down, and the reason I wrote it down is I've never... And by the way, I collect everything even once I think are maybe onto something. So I wrote down, \"A community with zero people speaking is dead and a community with one person speaking doesn't yet realize it's dead,\" is what I wrote down.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:24):\nSo fun. I love this practice that you have.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:59:28):\nBy the way, the reason I can do it, I can type insanely quickly. And in undergrad, I wrote my thesis on the emergent power dynamics in Wikipedia's user community and I did 150 hours of interviews with different editors in Wikipedia, and I transcribed them myself. And so I got really, really, really good at I can just pipe an idea straight into my fingertips and still listen to other stuff. So that's another superpower is I've just constantly, I'm able to capture it very, very quickly. I've written notes that are at least good enough for me to clean up within the next day or two into something that's more stable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:04):\nIs there a way you built this other than... Was it just you did it and you had to do it and you just figured out how to move fast?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:00:08):\nI just realized later that I could type really good, really fast. I could just pipe it straight through to my fingers and it worked",

I don't know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:22):\nI feel like everything you do is on super speed, the way you think, the write and get stuff done. There's a lot.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:00:30):\nI just realized when-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:31):\n... a lot of compute.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:00:32):\n... when you're feeling productive, you're unstoppable. And so just how can you be in your flow state as much as possible? And there's things that absolutely completely grind me to a halt, and I just make sure I invest my time in situations that don't have that characteristic. So when I work on something that I believe could work and have a big impact, I can't stop. Sometimes I'll wake up at 4:00 in the morning as I'm typically an early riser and I'm just like, \"I'll write this thing.\" The meeting starts at 7:00 and I just think there's an idea that's really cool here and I let myself lean into those kinds of when I have the moment.\n\n(01:01:05):\nI also find that often if I have an idea and I just have itching to write it down, if I can write down 30 minutes and get a very rough of it in one place, now it's easier to clean it up later. But that first act of creation, I do it whenever the muse hits because it's 10 million times if it's like, \"Oh, write that idea down later,\" you keep on delaying it, delaying it, now it's a month later. \"What was the idea? How did that work again?\" It's gone. And so I just try to capture the interesting insights. It's like a butterfly collector. The butterflies are going by, I try to collect them and put them in my collection as quickly as possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:38):\nOr garden as one might describe it.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:01:40):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:43):\nThis touches on a quote I wanted to talk to you about. I think you described it as your life philosophy. \"Do things that give you energy that you are proud of.\" Talk about that.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:01:54):\nSo to me, it's the combination of when you're doing something you believe in and that gives you energy, you are 10 times more productive. And you also, the effort that you are doing is its own reward. And so you are indefatigable on that topic and you go for much longer. So finding the substance of things that align with you that give you energy, then just it's like infinite energy. It's like they give an opportunity cost because it energizes you more than the opportunity cost of the time to go spend to other things.\n\n(01:02:21):\nAnd two, there are ways to give yourself energy, like for example, playing a video game, or there's any kind of mind-altering substance that might give you that like, \"This gives me energy.\" Those are not things that I'm not saying do those. I'm saying what are the things that you'll look back and say, \"I'm glad I did that. I'm proud that I did that.\" And if you take the perspective of a 10 years on looking back on each decision and thing that you're doing, and imagine seeing this decision played in front of 1,000 people whose opinion you care about, your family, your friends, your role models, would you be proud is a good sign of life that you're taking a broad enough perspective.\n\n(01:02:55):\nWhen you're busy and in the moment, it's so easy to say, \"I just got to do this one thing that's probably not great to get this thing done. And once I do it, it's going to suck. But once I do it, it'll be fine.\" And then you find yourself doing it again and again and again and again and before you know it, you've lost who you want to be and you're now a husk of yourself. And so I think those two pieces lean into where you find energy, where you specifically find energy, your superpower, the thing that you intrinsically enjoy doing, and just make sure it's something that you are actively proud of and that helped make sure you don't take a bunch of shortcuts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:29):\nAlong those same lines, I think a lot of people have heard a version of this quote, which is, \"New things that give you energy.\" So one, I love the additional piece of it is, \"and that you're proud of.\" Two, you have another quote that I love that makes you think deeply about stuff, which is, \"The secrets of life is things you've heard a million times already, you just weren't ready to hear them.\" Talk about that insight.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:03:53):\nSo this I call the Hallmark card fallacy, which is you discover at great effort some deep insight that resonates with you and makes you see the world differently, and you want to share it. Insights are naturally viral. You want to share them",

Insights are naturally viral. You want to share them and you go tell someone, it's like, \"Guys, guys, the point of life is the friends we made along the way.\" And people go, \"That's from a Hallmark card, man.\" And to you, it is you now possess the knowledge, the emotional intelligence to understand why that phrase has been shared so many times. Before, you heard it when you weren't ready and now it becomes a trite, \"Duh, everyone says that. That can't possibly be a meaningful statement.\"\n\n(01:04:30):\nThe reason people keep on saying it is because it's meaningful. And so I think that having that space of recognizing it, that when you have these epiphanies that come from different leaps in vertical development or the ability to, when you stare into the abyss and make it through the other side, you realize and learn a bunch of amazing things that you want to pass on others, and it's just really hard to get them to find it.\n\n(01:04:53):\nI find that that's one of the reasons I try to write things that are or share ideas that are like little seeds that you can shoot into someone's brain even if the soil's not ready for it, it's rocky or craggy, at some point in the future, if something goes through there and opens up a crack, that's sitting there to grow into an idea. One of the things that makes me the happiest is when someone I've mentored years and the years in the past, they go search me out years later and say, \"Alex, I just want to let you know, you probably don't even remember talking to me, but that Tuesday at the building, the no-name cafe or whatever, on Google campus, you said something I was frustrated to hear in the moment I didn't understand it. And I just want to tell you, thank you because I finally understand what you were trying to tell me. And I realized that that influenced me in the decisions.\" That to me is one of those meaningful things I can hear.\n\n(01:05:41):\nAnd so I just find that you can't force it before people are ready to hear certain topics.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:48):\nMan, that must feel so good to hear those sorts of closing the loop on something long ago. The point you make about cliches that you've heard a million times actually finally feeling right and profound, I had this very experience. I did a psychedelic trip with some friends a while ago, and at the end of it I was just like, \"Man, love is all you need. Love is all you need.\" I felt that so deeply through the experience and I was telling people, they're like, \"Shut up.\"\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:06:16):\nYou telling, oh, do you just do psychedelics? Yeah, it's funny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:19):\nYeah.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:06:19):\nI have a lot of folks in my broader space who obviously have used it. So I never personally have myself, but I find there's various ways. The transcendent mindset is this feeling of being part of something much, much, much larger than yourself and losing your ego in this thing. There's different ways of doing it. Some people will find it in hiking and being out in the wilderness alone. Some people find it being at a concert and thousands of people perfectly in sync to this thing. Some people find it in religious experience. Some people find it using psychedelics and others to help get there. But a lot of it, it's that same just being willing to be in awe.\n\n(01:06:53):\nThere's so many times that people feel the feeling of awe or wonder or curiosity is treated as a not very serious or childlike thing. And I just don't get that because that is how you are open to disconfirming evidence. It's how you see beyond the current limits of what you... Your ego gets hurt when you get disconfirming evidence. You don't want to hear it. And so you'll construct the world around yourself to not get that disconfirming evidence. But disconfirming evidence is what makes systems strong. It's what makes you strong. And so how do you put yourself in the situation to get that information and really receive it?\n\n(01:07:28):\nAnd part of it is just coming in terms of the fact of early in my career, someone called me kooky a bit. Oh, man. I must be embarrassed. I'm like, \"Okay, fine. Yeah, I'm kooky, whatever.\" I'm totally at peace with the idea that some people track me as kooky and not particularly serious. I think people who watch the work that I do and the indirect impact it has realize that I'm doing something that is working even if they don't fully understand how it works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:53):\nTo start to close our conversation, I want to throw out one more seed that might land with someone in the right time. You have this concept of the adjacent possible, which I think is a really powerful concept. And it's basically argues that a lot of people jump to big bold ideas, and instead the better approach is think about what's a constraint you have and lean into the constraints and use that as a guide.

And it's basically argues that a lot of people jump to big bold ideas, and instead the better approach is think about what's a constraint you have and lean into the constraints and use that as a guide. Can you just talk about this and how this might inform how people think about product and strategy?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:08:20):\nSure, yeah. The frame is the adjacent possible, which is I believe comes from design thinking. I've found it from designers in my life who are the ones who would just speak to it. And the adjacent possible is a set of actions that you do, that you can do. They are right in front of you that if you do them, they would work, almost certainly work. And in the tech industry in particular, we default assume that the adjacent possible is like this and then flying leap to something. And in reality, the adjacent possible is quite small. It's within arm's reach. And people will say, \"Oh, you're being nihilist. You're limiting your potential. You're saying don't do big things.\" But when you recognize that your adjacent possible is relatively small, you realize that you actually have full agency to pick within the subset that is within your reach, and your actions matter because you take an action and now the world reconfigures and now you get a next set of actions and it's based partially on the action you just took.\n\n(01:09:11):\nAnd so if you slice this thing up and you have a coherent worldview and you have a principled approach, you can arc to wildly different outcomes than look like they were possible while at each point, each individual action is safe and reasonable. And so you can combine both of these things. I think so many times we try to jump and we jump to the end state of the thing. And actually you don't need to make that decision. If you can slice up your decisions into smaller and smaller decisions, I'm like, \"This next step definitely makes sense.\" It will almost certainly pay for itself or the very least won't be too expensive. And then it might allow these other things to happen and you take it. And if those other things don't happen, okay, don't take another step on that path. That's fine. Go in other directions for a while. If it does, then take another step and another and another and another.\n\n(01:09:50):\nAnd this allows you to get rid of a lot of the risk and still be exposed to all the upside. And so the risk comes from trying to jump too far ahead in an unknown environment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:02):\nIs the general advice if someone's working on trying to figure out the roadmap, trying to think about what products to build is the advice, don't be scared to go a little incremental versus what people are always pushed, to do bigger.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:10:13):\nYou need both. So if you only do incremental, you will follow the shortest, the steepest gradient in front of you. So UXR says a user wants to do this and you'll do exactly that and you'll end up random walking through the thing. So you need coherence about where you're going and the way you get that is by creating a North Star for yourself. It should be in three to five years in the future, it should be very low resolution. It should describe a thing that every single person who reads it who has any kind of knowledge that might be useful or relevant agrees that it is plausible. If this happens, I would not say, \"Well, a miracle happened.\" It'd say, \"I could see how that could work.\" And lawyers say, \"I could see how that could work.\" And someone who's worked on this 30 years ago at a similar product that Microsoft says, \"I can see how that could work.\"\n\n(01:10:51):\nAnd that if you got to the end point, everyone would high five because if it's going to be a thing, they're like, \"I guess that could work.\" At the end we'd be like, \"Oh yeah, neat.\" That's not worth it. You want another story would be like, \"Yeah, great. Wow, we kick off. We changed the way this entire industry works,\" or whatever. And now this is your North Star. North Star should update, but it's because it's far off in the distance. It will update. It will slide up across the sky a little bit. It won't be jerking around. You'll be arcing slightly differently. And then what you do is you look in your adjacent possible and you look for the thing that has the steepest gradient that pulls you towards your North Star. So you just want to go in that direction and you want to go in this direction. This one is second most in demand from what you think, but it's pulling you the direction that you believe will pull you there. Go in that one.\n\n(01:11:31):\nAnd then they keep on repeating. That's it. But you need both. Because if you only do incremental, then you'll end up random walking into a corner. And if you only do the long-term, you end up dreaming big and designing castles in the sky that are impossible to actually manifest.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:45):\nTo give you a metaphor from an experience I had, I did this silent meditation retreat once, and a big part of Buddhism is to not cling to a specific outcome and not have a plan in mind and be sad if it doesn't work out.

Just point your card in that direction, essentially in your example of North Star, and just start walking. Don't figure out this is exactly the path I'm going to take to get to this end destination.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:12:19):\nYeah. And you'll know after the fact, you'll say, \"Oh, I curved a little bit or I had this little jog than there.\" And you'll say, \"Ah, it would've been more efficient.\" But we're so focused on efficiency of not wasting effort that we ended up doing nothing at all or doing very dangerous things that don't work. So I'm much sure that I have a path that's slightly inefficient because we're navigating unknowns and we couldn't know no point. I think I've seen the number of times I find where people say, \"I need to know for this strategy,\" that someone was trying to get me to look at and then say, \"is this number in five years, is it going to be 93 or 95?\" And it's like, I don't know. And it doesn't matter either if it's going to be that order of magnitude.\n\n(01:12:56):\nIt doesn't matter, and we don't have to do that analysis if we believe that the order of magnitude is of that thing. It'd actually be we had spent all the time to get the illusion of precision, which at great expense, and then it's the people say, \"Oh, I'm data-driven. I want to really run the analysis to ground.\" There's tons of stuff you can't know ahead of time. So if you're getting a false precision at the beginner, that's a comfort blanket. That's just helping you feel like there isn't uncertainty. There's uncertainty everywhere all the time. And trying to ignore it by trying to pin it down with fake numbers that you just made up for yourself at great expense is a really bad idea. And that's why if the ideas are strong enough, things that have a compounding return don't give you, \"Oh, we'll either get 93 or 95.\" It's like, \"We'll either get zero or we'll get 1,000.\" Great. It doesn't really matter if it's 1,000 or 1,001, who cares? It orders a magnitude larger than the alternative, and so it is better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:48):\nThat's really freeing. I noticed again, you were writing something. I'm again curious which you wrote down that you thought was insightful.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:13:54):\nI actually this time I was not writing did something down. I was checking a thing I thought you might say that was going to reference was Tim Urban's, \"Happiness is the reality minus expectations.\" I always get that backwards, but have you heard this frame, that happiness-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:07):\nLet's get into it. Yeah, we're not going to get this. This is great.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:14:09):\n\"Happiness is reality minus expectations,\" and this is Tim Urban. It was from Wait But Why. And I think it's a very simple distillation of it, of if you set your expectations super high and it comes in and it's amazing, but it's below it, then it's a net negative. So the easiest thing, reality is hard to change. It's not impossible. It's hard to change. Your expectations are super easy. So just change your expectations. Hold it lightly and don't say, \"Oh my gosh, this is going to be my kid's birthday. She's going to remember it. It's going to be the best birthday that she ever had and we're all it's going to be perfect.\" Because then when it doesn't go perfect and it starts raining that day, you're like, \"Gosh.\" You get all worked up. Just say, \"No, I want spend this day in a way that I can look back on and remember fondly.\" And that will include, yeah, it changed.\n\n(01:14:54):\nOne other piece of advice someone gave me that I really like is try to feel the emotion about the story that'll make you feel in 10 years. So if it's funny in 10 years, try to see the humor in it now. And this one in particular was a friend, their newborn would, every time you changed her diaper, would poop. That was only... And when they did it, it would often be projectile. And so it was like a trap. You change the diaper. And it was like, what are you going to do in that situation? And then they're just like, \"It's going to be a funny story in a few years, so let's see the humor in it now.\" Even though, God, I really wish this year-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):\nThat's funny.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:15:29):\n... you're not spraying poop on her. And I think that that kind of perspective is really, people sometimes hear this as, \"Oh, you're saying don't dream big. Don't set high expectations. Don't expect more and be okay with mediocrity.\" That is not what I'm saying. I'm saying hold those expectations lightly. Allow them to change. Be willing to be convinced by",

Be willing to be convinced by different things, and seek something great. Seek something that you can be truly proud of and that feel very authentic to yourself if you achieved.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:57):\nAlex, I feel like I could talk to you for hours. I can't believe it's already been almost an hour and a half. So just to wrap things up, is there anything else that you thought would be fun to share or maybe a piece of wisdom you want to leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:16:13):\nI think we covered it. I think we covered a lot of that. And again, we could go on for hours and hours and hours and hours. I could just do a random... I can feature The Compendium where I can pull up a random idea, and let's not do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:24):\nOkay, amazing. Well, Alex, with that, we've reached the very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:16:28):\nI am ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:30):\nFirst question, what are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:16:33):\nOrigin of Wealth by Eric Beinhocker, which is great. It's about a complexity economics, why the traditional economic model doesn't work, and also why it takes an evolutionary lens on what kinds of business plans work and how companies execute them. That I found my entree into a lot of the systems thinking and I thought it was just absolutely brilliant. And the other one is The Elements of Thinking in Systems, which is short, easy to read, very approachable. In fact, if anything, people think of it as not serious enough because it's too easy to read. It's one of those books that when you read at the beginning you'll say, \"This sounds right.\" And then later, years later, if you read it again you'll go, \"Oh my God, that was so... I wasn't ready for that yet, but that is totally the way.\" So she's one of the people who talks about dancing the systems. Let go and dance with the system is one of her lines, and I think it's just a phenomenal book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:21):\nNext question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:17:24):\nFor me, I was thinking about this, it's The Green Knight, which I watched I think a few years old. It's about the Arthurian legend. It's a challenging movie. In fact, when I watched it, I was like, \"I dislike this. I do not find this interesting.\" And then I couldn't stop thinking about it and it helped me. I think this is one of the reasons I like to write in parable is a parable is open-ended. It encourages and requires the listener to engage into the idea and play with it and see how it affects them and how they affect it. And so for me, The Green Knight, again, I'm not excited to watch it again, but I found it to be the most impactful movie I've seen in the last couple of years in terms of amount of thinking that it caused me to do afterwards.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:04):\nWow, that says a lot. Next question, do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:18:10):\nTo me, I think the answer for me is WebSim. It's the one that I like playing around with a lot. And I've said it before, I use Claude 20 times a day. I find that it's almost impossible for me to imagine doing work. I mean of course now I've got to use Strawberry and see how that feels, but yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:28):\nOne use case of WebSim that I found really fun that I used with Dylan is if you do Gmail, if you give it gmail.com/someone's name, it just comes up with what their email looks like. And could do it for famous people, like for Patrick Allison or whoever, and it's like, \"Wow, that's really good.\"\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:18:45):\nThe elements are really good. One of the things we played around with is having a thing that generates fake data of arbitrary schemas, and I just write a short backstory of a person and then have it generate data that fits in this fictional user person's world. And it's just amazing the kinds of stuff, the coherence it has with, it's weird and it's very specific to that story, but elements are just so, they're like these little holograms of all this information of humanity is interesting informational package, this little thing. And all kinds, it's like a mirror that different things reflect back out of it at you. And it's shocking sometimes to see humanity reflected back at you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:29):\nIt's like a zip file of all human knowledge.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:19:31):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:32):\nAmazing. And it's because it's trained on",

You have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:19:43):\nI guess I've said too, this is cheating, but I said too, the do things that give you energy that you're proud of, and the happiness is reality minus expectations I think are really simple clarifying words to look like.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:56):\nAll right. Final question. You can go in one of two directions. One is what's something that you are going to add to this week's Bits and Bobs that you're thinking about right now that we haven't talked about? Or just go to your Compendium and pick a random thing and see what comes up and share.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:20:11):\nOkay, so this is the... I'll just read this off.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:14):\nGreat.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:20:16):\nThis is written a year ago.\n\n(01:20:18):\n\"We've forgotten a world without aggregators. Non-aggregator ecosystems make it so participants don't have to fear empowering their overlord, where that you have to worry about each bit of action you're doing, the aggregator is getting it more and more powerful. MySpace was the Wild West. Facebook made it so you can't change the CSS, which was better for users, containing some freedom. Aggregators make sense in the late stage of an era. At the beginning, they curtail too much exploration.\"\n\n(01:20:42):\nThat's just my random reflections. I don't even remember what conversation that came from originally, but of the power of... I am just so obsessed with the idea that we are in the late stage of this current technical paradigm that we're in and so many things we feel like we figured them all out and nothing can be any different, and I don't love this outcome that we're in, the idea of you're... Just one quick framing. To me, if you ask somebody on the street to tell you what the canonical piece of software is, the answer they'll give you is something like Instagram, which is to say an app, which I think is a shame because an app is monolithic. It's one size fits all. It's not decomposable. It doesn't meaningfully interact with anything else in the broader ecosystem. And it's also only allowed to exist if some of the largest companies in the world say it may exist, which is insane to me.\n\n(01:21:26):\nTo me, software is alchemy. It's the ability to extend human agency beyond ourselves to create something that can then combine with what others have created in unexpected and unforeseen ways to create this commentary of possibility of human agency. And somehow in the past decade, we've become convinced that all of this potential should be squeezed into about a dozen little boxes on your phone. And now with the power of AI, everyone just is default assuming that what's going to happen is we're all going to be locked inside of a box with a super God AI Clippy. And the only thing that people disagree about is which Clippy is it going to be? Whose Clippy is it going to be?\n\n(01:21:57):\nThat to me is bonkers. I don't want that world at all. I want a world where we use this magical duct tape to escape the box, to allow software and humans using it to lean into their agency. And I think aggregators are amazing in an environment where you have a safe environment to have all kinds of interesting stuff that can't be fully open-ended because the aggregator can't allow it to escape the possibility of that ecosystem. And so for me, one of the reasons I'm excited about LLMs being a disruptive technology is I think that it allows us to get out of this monolithic sense of whatever. We're all just beholden to a decreasing number, very powerful organizations, and lean into everybody being able to be creative and collaborative and exercise their agency in a pro-social way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:41):\nWow. Well, you blew our mind as a final element of this conversation. Alex, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online? Where do they find stuff you're working on if they want to read more and follow the stuff you're thinking about? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:22:58):\nKomoroske.com is where. My husband gives me so much shit for it because it looks like it was designed in the early 2000s, which it was. I link to all the different posts there. If you click, there's a Google group, but now where you can subscribe to my updates whenever I post in the Bits and Bobs or any medium article, that's a good way of taking touch as I publish stuff.\n\n(01:23:16):\nAnd then the way that Google can be useful to me is I have office hours on my site that are open to anybody to join in. I am continually, they're booked off in a few weeks in advance, but if you find something that",

And I love, love, love talking to people, interesting people especially who have life experiences and backgrounds that are different from mine. At one point, a magician showed up in my office hours and described and said, \"Hey, this tactic you're talking about in your Bits and Bobs, that's actually cold reading.

And so people just reaching out and sharing ideas and I love.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:59):\nAlex, you're awesome. This conversation was exactly what I was hoping it'd be.

We think of Codex as just the beginning of a software engineering teammate. It's a bit like this really smart intern that refuses to read Slack, doesn't check Datadog unless you ask it to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):\nI remember Karpathy tweeted the gnarliest bugs that he runs into that he just spends hours trying to figure out nothing else has solved, he gives it to Codex, lets it run for an hour and it solves it.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:00:21):\nStarting to see glimpses of the future where we're actually starting to have Codex be on call for its own training. Codex writes a lot of the code that helps manage its training run, the key infrastructure. So we have a Codex code review that's catching a lot of mistakes. It's actually caught some pretty interesting configuration mistakes. One of the most mind-blowing examples of acceleration, the Sora Android app, like a fully new app, we built it in 18 days and then 10 days later, so 28 days total, we went to the public.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):\nHow do you think you win in this space?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:00:47):\nOne of our major goals with Codex is to get to proactivity. If we're going to build a super system, has to be able to do things. One of the learnings over the past year is that for models to do stuff, they're much more effective when they can use a computer. It turns out the best way for models to use computers is simply to write code. And so we're kind of getting to this idea where if you want to build any agent, maybe you should be building a coding agent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):\nWhen you think about progress on Codex, I imagine you have a bunch of evals and there's all these public benchmarks.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:01:10):\nA few of us are constantly on Reddit. There's praise up there and there's a lot of complaints. What we can do is as a product team just try to always think about how are we building a tool so that it feels like we're maximally accelerating people rather than building a tool that makes it more unclear what you should do as the human?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:24):\nBeing at OpenAI, I can't not ask about how far you think we are from AGI.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:01:28):\nThe current underappreciated limiting factor is literally human typing speed or human multitasking speed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):\nToday, my guest is Alexander Embiricos, product lead for Codex, OpenAI's incredibly popular and powerful coding agent. In the words of Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT and former podcast guest, \"Alex is one of my all time favorite humans I've ever worked with, and bringing him and his company into OpenAI ended up being one of the best decisions we've ever made.\" Similarly, Kevin Weil, OpenAI's CPO, said, \"Alex is simply the best.\"\n\n(00:01:59):\nIn our conversation, we chat about what it's truly like to build product at OpenAI, how Codex allowed the Sora team to ship the Sora app, which became the number one app in the app store in under one month. Also, the 20x growth Codex is seeing right now and what they did to make it so good at coding, why his team is now focused on making it easier to review code, not just write code, his AGI timelines, his thoughts on when AI agents will actually be really useful, and so much more.

I've been following for ages and I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:21):\nI'm even more excited. I really appreciate that. I want to start with your time at OpenAI. So you joined OpenAI about a year ago. Before that, you had your own startup for about five years. Before that, you were a product manager at Dropbox. I imagine OpenAI is very different from every other place you've worked. Let me just ask you this, what is most different about how OpenAI operates and what's something that you've learned there that you think you're going to take with you wherever you go, assuming you ever leave?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:05:49):\nBy far, I would say the speed and ambition of working at OpenAI are just dramatically more than what I can imagine. And I guess it's kind of an embarrassing thing to say because everyone who's a startup founder thinks like, \"Oh yeah, my startup moves super fast and the talent bar is super high and we're super ambitious.\" But I have to say, working in OpenAI just made me reimagine what that even means.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:11):\nWe hear this a lot about feels like every AI company is just like, \"Oh my God, I can't believe how fast they're moving.\" Is there an example of just like, \"Wow, that wouldn't have happened this quickly anywhere else\"?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:06:20):\nThe most obvious thing that comes to mind is just the explosive growth of Codex itself. I think it's a while since we bumped our external number, but it's like the 10x-ing of Codex's scale was just super fast in a matter of months and it's well more since then. And once you've lived through that, or at least speaking for myself, having lived through that now, I feel like anytime I'm going to spend my time on building tech product, there's that speed and scale that I now need to meet.\n\n(00:06:52):\nIf I think of what I was doing in my startup, it moved way slower and there's always this balance with startups of how much do you commit to an idea that you have versus find out that it's not working and then pivot. But I think one thing I've realized at OpenAI is the amount of impact that we can have and, in fact, need to have to do a good job is so high that I have to be way more ruthless with how I spend my time now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:15):\nBefore we get to Codex, is there a way that they've structured the org or, I don't know, the way that OpenAI operates that allows the team to move this quickly? Because everyone wants to move super fast. I imagine there's a structural approach to allowing this to happen.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:07:29):\nI mean, so one thing is just the technology that we're building with has just transformed so many things from both how we build, but also what kinds of things we can enable for users. And we spend most of our time talking about the sort of improvements within the foundation models, but I believe that even if we had no more progress today with models, which is absolutely not the case, but even if we had no more progress, we are way behind on product. There's so much more product to build. So I think just the moment is ripe, if that makes sense.\n\n(00:08:01):\nBut I think there's a lot of counterintuitive things that surprised me when I arrived as far as how things are structured. One example that comes to mind is when I was working on my startup and before that, when I was at Dropbox, it was very important, especially as a PM to always rally the ship and it was like make sure you're pointed",

One example that comes to mind is when I was working on my startup and before that, when I was at Dropbox, it was very important, especially as a PM to always rally the ship and it was like make sure you're pointed in the right direction and then you can accelerate in that direction. But here, I think because we don't exactly know what capabilities will even come up soon and we don't know what's going to work technically, and then we also don't know what's going to land even if it works technically, it's much more important for us to be very humble and learn a lot more empirically and just try things quickly. And the org is set up in that way to be incredibly bottoms up.\n\n(00:08:45):\nThis is, again, one of those things that, as you were saying, everyone wants to move fast. I think everyone likes to say that they're bottoms up, or at least a lot of people do, but OpenAI is truly, truly bottoms up. And that's been a learning experience for me that now it'll be interesting if I ever work at... I don't think it'll even make sense to work at a non-AI company in the future. I don't even know what that means. But if I were to imagine it or go back in time, I think I would run things totally new.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:10):\nWhat I'm hearing is this ready, fire, aim is the approach more than ready, aim, fire. And there's something, and as you process that, because that may not come across well, but I actually have heard this a lot at AI companies is because you don't know, and Nick Turley shared I think the same sentiment, because you don't know how people will use it it doesn't make sense to spend a lot of time making it perfect. It's better to just get it out there in a primordial way, see how people use it, and then go big on that use case.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:09:39):\nYeah. Okay, to use this analogy a little bit, I feel like there is an aim component, but the aim component is much fuzzier. It's kind of like, roughly what do we think can happen? Someone I've learned a ton from working here is a research lead, and he likes to say that at OpenAI, we can have really good conversations about something that's a year plus from now, and there's a lot of ambiguity in what will happen, but that's a right sort of timeline. And then we can have really good conversations about what's happening in low months or weeks. But there's this awkward middle ground, which was as you start approaching a year, but you're not at a year where it's very difficult to reason about, right?\n\n(00:10:18):\nAnd so as far as aiming, I think we want to know, \"Okay, what are some of the futures that we're trying to build towards?\" And a lot of the problems we're dealing with in AI, such as alignment are problems you need to be thinking out really far out into the future. So we're kind of aiming fuzzily there, but when it comes down to the more tactically like, \"Oh yeah, what product will we build and therefore how will people use that product?\" That's the place where we're much more like, \"Let's find out empirically.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:41):\nThat's a good way of putting it. Something else that when people hear this, people sometimes hear companies like yours saying, \"Okay, we're going to be bottoms up. We're going to try a bunch of stuff. We're not going to have exactly a plan of where it's going in the next few months.\" The key is you all hire the best people in the world. And so that feels like a really key ingredient in order to be this successful at bottoms up work.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:11:02):\nIt just super resonates with me. I was just, again, surprised or even shocked when I arrived at the level of individual drive and autonomy that everyone here has. So I think the way that OpenAI runs, you can't read this or listen to a podcast and be like, \"I'm just going to deploy this to my company.\" Maybe this is a harsh thing to say, but I think very few companies have the talent caliber to be able to do that. So it might need to be adjusted if you were going to implement this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:34):\nOkay. So let's talk Codex. You lead work on Codex. How's Codex going? What numbers can you share? Is there anything you can share there? Also, just not everyone knows exactly what Codex is, explain what Codex is.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:11:45):\nTotally, yeah. So I had the very lucky job of living in the future and leading products on Codex. And Codex is OpenAI's coding agent. So super concretely, that means it's an IDE extension, a VS code extension that you can install or a terminal tool that you can install. And when you do so, you can then basically pair with Codex to answer questions about code, write code, run tests, execute code, and do a bunch of the work in that thick middle section of the software development lifecycle, which is all about writing code that you're going to get into production.\n\n(00:12:21):\nMore broadly, we think of Codex as what it currently is just the beginning of a software engineering teammate. So when we use a big word like teammate,",

So when we use a big word like teammate, some of the things we're imagining are that it's not only able to write code, but actually it participates early on in the ideation and planning phases of writing software and then further downstream in terms of validation, deploying and maintaining code.\n\n(00:12:46):\nTo make that a little more fun, one thing I like to imagine is if you think of what Codex is today, it's a bit like this really smart intern that refuses to read Slack and doesn't check Datadog or Century unless you ask it to. And so no matter how smart it is, how much are you going to trust it to write code without you also working with it? So that's how people use it mostly today is they pair with it. But we want to get to the point where it can work just like a new intern that you hire, you don't only ask them to write code, but you ask them to participate across the cycle. So you know that even if they don't get something right the first try, they're eventually going to be able to iterate their rate there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:21):\nI thought the point about not reading Slack and Datadog was it's just not distracted, it's just constantly focused and is always in flow. But I get what you're saying there is it doesn't have all the context on everything that's going on.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:13:31):\nYeah. And that's not only true when it's performing a task, but again, if you think of the best team and teammates, you don't tell them what to do. Maybe when you first hire them, you have a couple meetings and you're like, \"Hey,\" you learn, \"Okay, these prompts work for this teammate, these prompts don't. This is how to communicate with this person.\" Then eventually you give them some starter tasks, you delegate a few tasks. But then eventually you just say like, \"Hey, great. Okay, you're working with this set of people in this area of the code base. Feel free to work with other people on other parts of the code base too, even. And yeah, you tell me what you think makes sense to be done.\" And so we think of this as proactivity and one of our major goals with Codex is to get to proactivity.\n\n(00:14:09):\nI think this is critically important to achieve the mission of OpenAI, which is to deliver the benefits of AGI to all humanity. I like to joke today that AI products, and it's a half joke, they're actually really hard to use because you have to be very thoughtful about when it could help you. And if you're not prompting a model to help you, it's probably not helping you at that time. And if you think of how many times the average user is prompting AI today, it's probably tens of times. But if you think of how many times people could actually get benefit from a really intelligent entity, it's thousands of times per day. And so a large part of our goal with Codex is to figure out what is the shape of an actual teammate agent that is helpful by default.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:54):\nWhen people think about Cursor and even Cloud Code, it's like a IDE that helps you code and auto completes code and maybe does some agentic work. What I'm hearing here is the vision is different, which is it's a teammate. It's like a remote teammate, a building code for you that you talk to and ask to do things. And that also does IDE, auto complete and things like that. Is that a kind of a differentiator in the way you think about Codex?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:15:18):\nIt's basically this idea that if you're a developer and you're trying to get something done, we want you to just feel like you have superpowers and you're able to move much, much faster. But we don't think that in order for you to reap those benefits, you need to be sitting there constantly thinking about, \"How can I invoke AI at this point to do this thing?\" We want you to be able to plug it in to the way that you work and have it just start to do stuff without you having to think about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:44):\nOkay. I have a lot of questions along those lines, but just how's it going? Is there any stats, any numbers you can share about how Codex is doing?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:15:49):\nYeah, Codex has been growing absolutely explosively since the launch of GPT-5 back in August. There's definitely some interesting product insights to talk about as to how we unlock that growth, if you're interested. But again, the last stat we shared there was we were well over 10x since August. In fact, it's been 20x since then. Also, the Codex models are serving many trillions of tokens a week now, and it's basically our most served coding model. One of the really cool things that we've seen is that the way that we decided to set up the Codex team was to build a really tightly integrated product and research team that are iterating on the model and the harness together. And it turns out that lets you just do a lot more and try many more experiments as to how these things will work together.\n\n(00:16:35",

And it turns out that lets you just do a lot more and try many more experiments as to how these things will work together.\n\n(00:16:35):\nAnd so we were just training these models for use in our first party harness that we were very opinionated about. And then what we've started to see more recently actually is that other major API coding customers are now starting to adopt these models as well. And so we've reached a point where actually the Codex model is the most served coding model in the API as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:55):\nYou hinted at this, what unlocked this growth, I'm extremely interested in hearing that. It felt like before, I don't know, maybe this was before you joined the team, it just felt like Cloud Code was killing it. Just everyone was sitting on top of Cloud Code. It was by far the best way to code. And then all of a sudden Codex comes around. I remember Karpathy tweeted that he just has never seen a model like this. I think the tweet was the gnarliest bugs that he runs into that he just spends hours trying to figure out nothing else has solved, he gives it to Codex, lets it run for an hour and it solves it. What'd you guys do?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:17:30):\nWe have this strong sort of mission here at OpenAI basically to build AGI. And so we think a lot about how can we shape the product so that it can scale. Earlier I was mentioning like, \"Hey, if you're an engineer, you should be getting help from AI thousands of times per day,\" and so we thought a lot about the primitives for that when we launched our first version of Codex, which was Codex Cloud. And that was basically a product that had its own computer, lived in the cloud, you could delegate to it. And the coolest part about that is you could run many, many tasks in parallel. But some of the challenges that we saw are that it's a little bit harder to set that up, both in terms of environment configuration, like giving the model the tools it needs to validate its changes and to learn how to prompt in that way.\n\n(00:18:20):\nMy analogy for this is, going back to this teammate analogy, it's like if you hired a teammate, but you're never allowed to get on a call with them and you can only go back and forth asynchronously over time. That works for some teammates and eventually that's actually how you want to spend most of your time. So that's still the future, but it's hard to initially adopt. And so we still have that vision of like, that's what we're trying to get you to, a teammate that you delegate to and then is proactive, and we're seeing that growing. But the key unlock is actually first you need to land with users in a way that's much more intuitive and trivial to get value from.\n\n(00:18:54):\nSo the way that most people discover, the vast majority of users discover Codex today is either they download an IDE extension or they run it in their CLI and the agent works there with you on your computer interactively. And it works within a sandbox, which is actually a really cool piece of tech to help that be safe and secure, but it has access to all those dependencies. So if the agent needs to do something, it needs to run a command, it can do so within the sandbox. We don't have to set up any environment. And if it's a command that doesn't work in the sandbox, it can just ask you. And so you can get into this really strong feedback loop using the model. And then over time, our team's job is to help turn that feedback loop into you as a byproduct of using the product, configuring it so that you can then be delegating to it down the line.\n\n(00:19:38):\nAnd again, analogy, keep coming back to it, but if you hire a teammate and you ask them to do work, but you just give them a fresh computer from the store, it's going to be hard for them to do their job. But if as you work with them side by side, you could be like, \"Oh, you don't have a password for this service we use, here's the password for this service. Yeah, don't worry, feel free to run this command,\" then it's much easier for them to then go off and do work for hours without you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:01):\nSo what I'm hearing is the initial version of Codex was almost too far in the future. It's like a remote in the cloud agent that's coding for you asynchronously. And what you did is, \"Okay, let's actually come back a little bit, let's integrate into the way engineers already integrate into IDs and locally and help them on ramp to this new world,\"\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:20:21):\nTotally. And it was quite interesting because we dogfood product a ton at OpenAI. So dogfood as in we use our own product. And so Codex has been accelerating OpenAI over the course of the entire year, and the cloud product was a massive accelerant to the company as well. It just turns out that this was one of those places where the signal we got from dogfooding is a little bit different from the signal you get from the general market because at OpenAI, we train reasoning models all day and so we're very used to this kind of prompting and think upfront",

And so now when we build, we still get a ton of signal from dogfooding internally, but we're also very cognizant of the different ways that different audiences use the product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):\nThat's really funny. It's like live in the future, but maybe not too far in the future. And I could see how everyone at OpenAI is living very far in the future, and sometimes that won't work for everyone.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:21:23):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:23):\nWhat about just intelligence training data? I don't know, is there something else that helped Codex accelerate its ability to actually code? Is it better, cleaner data? Is it more just models advancing? Is there anything else that really helped accelerate?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:21:38):\nYeah, so there's a few components here. I guess you were mentioning models and the models have improved a ton. In fact, just last Wednesday, we shipped GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, a very accurately named model, that is awesome. It is awesome both because it is for any given task that you were using GPT-5.1-Codex for, it's roughly 30% faster at accomplishing that task. But also it unlocks a ton of intelligence. So if you use it at our higher reasoning levels, it's just even smarter. And that tweet you were saying Karpathy made about, \"Hey, give this your gnarliest bugs,\" obviously there's a ton going on in the market right now, but Codex-Max is definitely carrying that mantle of us tackling the hardest bugs. So that is super cool.\n\n(00:22:28):\nBut I will say it's like some of how we're thinking about this is evolving a little bit from being like, \"Yeah, we're just going to think about the model and let's just train the best model,\" to really thinking about what is an agent actually overall? And I'm not going to try to define agent exactly, but at least the stack that we think of it as having is it's like you have this model, really smart reasoning model that knows how to do a specific kind of task really well, so we can talk about how we make that possible. But then actually we need to serve that model through an API into a harness, and both of those things also have a really big role here.\n\n(00:23:02):\nSo for instance, one of the things that we're really proud of is you can have GPT-5.1-Codex-Max work for really long periods of time. That's not normal, but you can set it up to do that or that might happen. But now routinely we'll hear about people saying, \"Yeah, it ran overnight or it ran for 24 hours.\" And so for a model to work continuously for that amount of time, it's going to exceed its context window. And so we have a solution for that, which we call compaction.\n\n(00:23:28):\nBut compaction is actually a feature that uses all three layers of that stack. So you need to have a model that has a concept of compaction and knows like, \"Okay, as I start to approach this context window, I might be asked to prepare to be run in a new context window.\" And then at the API layer, you need an API that understands this concept and has an endpoint that you can hit to do this change. And at the harness layer, you need a harness that can prepare the payload for this to be done. So shipping this compaction feature that now just made this behavior possible to anyone using Codex actually meant working across all three things. And I think that's increasingly going to be true.\n\n(00:24:02):\nAnother maybe underappreciated version of this is if you think about all the different coding products out there, they all have very different tool harnesses with very different opinions on how the model should work. So if you want to train a model to be good at all the different ways it could work, maybe you have a strong opinion that it should work using semantic search. Maybe you have a strong opinion that it should call bespoke tools or maybe you have, in our case, a strong opinion that it should just use the shell and work in the terminal, you can move much faster if you're just optimizing for one of those worlds. So the way that we built Codex is that it just uses the shell, but in order to make that safer and secure, we have a sandbox that the model is used to operating in.\n\n(00:24:45):\nSo I think one of the biggest accelerants, to go all the way back to answer to your question, is just we're building all three things in parallel and tuning each one and constantly experimenting with how those things work with a tightly integrated product and research team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:59):\nDo you think you win in this space? Do you think it'll always be this kind of race with other models constantly leapfrogging each other? Do you think there's a world where someone just runs away with it and no one else can ever catch up? Is there a path to just, \"We win\"?",

Do you think there's a world where someone just runs away with it and no one else can ever catch up? Is there a path to just, \"We win\"?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:25:15):\nAgain, comes back to this idea of building a teammate, and not just a teammate that participates in team planning and prioritization, not just a teammate that really tests its code and helps you maintain and deploy it. But even a teammate... If you think, again, an engineering teammate, they can also schedule a calendar invite or move standup or do whatever, right? And so in my mind, if we just imagine that every day or every week some crazy new capability is just going to be deployed by a research lab, it's just impossible for us as humans to keep up and use all this technology. So I think we need to get to this world where you kind of just have an AI teammate or super assistant that you just talk to and it just knows how to be helpful on its own. So you don't have to be reading the latest tips for how to use it, you've plugged it in and it just provides help.\n\n(00:26:10):\nSo that's kind of the shape of what I think we're building. And I think that will be a very sticky winning product if we can do so. So the shape that in my head, at least I have, is that we build... Maybe a fun topic is like, \"Is Chat the right interface for AI?\" I actually think Chat is a very good interface when you don't know what you're supposed to use it for. In the same way that if I think of I'm on MS Teams or in Slack with a teammate, Chat is pretty good. I can ask for whatever I want. It's kind of the common denominator for everything. So you can chat with a super assistant about whatever topic you want, whether it be coding or not. And then if you are a functional expert in a specific domain such as coding, there's a GUI that you can pull up to go really deep and look at the code and work with the code.\n\n(00:26:54):\nSo I think what we need to build as OpenAI is basically this idea of you have Chat, ChatGPT and not as a tool that's ubiquitously available to everyone, you start using it even outside of work to just help you. You become very comfortable with the idea of being accelerated with AI. So then you get to work and you just can naturally just, \"Yeah, I'm just going to ask it for this and I don't need to know about all the connectors or all the different features. I'm just going to ask it for help and it'll surface to me the best way that it can help at this point in time and maybe even chime in when I didn't ask it for help.\" So in my mind, if we can get to that, I think that's how we really build the winning product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:32):\nThis is so interesting because with my chat with Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT, I think he shared that the original name for ChatGPT was Super Assistant or something like that. And it's interesting that there's that approach to the super assistant and then there's this Codex approach. It's almost like the B2C version and the B2B version. And what I'm hearing is the idea here is, okay, you start with coding and building and then it's doing all this other stuff for you, scheduling meetings, I don't know, probably posting in Slack, I don't know, shipping designs. I don't know, is the idea that this is the business version of ChatGPT in a sense, or is there something else there?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:28:08):\nYeah. So we're getting to the one-year time horizon conversation. A lot of this might happen sooner, but in terms of fuzziness, I think we're at the one year. So I'll give you a contention and a plausible way we get there, but as for how it happens, who knows? So basically, if we're going to build a super assistant, it has to be able to do things. So we're going to have a model and it's going to be able to do stuff affecting your world. And one of the learnings I think we've seen over the past year or so is that for models to do stuff, they're much more effective when they can use a computer.\n\n(00:28:41):\nRight, okay, so now we're like, okay, we need the super assistant that can use a computer, or many computers. And now the question is, okay, well, how should it use the computer? And there's lots of ways to use a computer. You could try to hack the OS and use accessibility APIs, maybe a bit easier as you could point and click. That's a little slow and unpredictable sometimes. And another way, it turns out the best way for models to use computers is simply to write code. So we're kind of getting to this idea where, well, if you want to build any agent, maybe you should be building a coding agent and maybe to the user, a non-technical user, they won't even know they're using a coding agent, the same way that no one thinks about are they using the internet or not, which is they're more just like, \"Is WiFi on?\"\n\n(00:29:23):\nSo I think that what we're doing with Codex is we're building a software engineering teammate, and as part of that, we're kind of building an agent that can use a",

And so we're already seeing some pull for this. It's quite early, but we're starting to see people who are using Codex for coding adjacent product purposes. And so as that develops, I think we'll just naturally see that, oh, it turns out we should just always have the agent write code if there is a coding way to solve a problem instead of... Even if you're doing a financial analysis, maybe write some code for that.\n\n(00:29:55):\nSo basically like you were like, \"Hey, is this the two ends of this product for the super assistant of ChatGPT?\" In my mind, just coding is a core competency of any agent including ChatGPT. And so really what we think we're building is that competency. So here's the really cool thing about agents writing code is that you can import code. Code is composable, interoperable. Because one very reductive view we could have for an agent is it's just going to be given a computer and it's just going to point and click and go around. But that is the future. And then how we get there is difficult to chart a path because a lot of the questions around building agents aren't like, \"Can the agent do it?\" But it's more about, \"Well, how can we help the agent understand the context that it's working in?\" And the team that's using it probably has a way that they like to do things. They have guidelines. They probably want certain deterministic guarantees about what the agent can or cannot do. Or they want to know that the agent understands this detail.\n\n(00:30:57):\nAn example would be if we're looking at a crash reporting tool, hitting a connector for it, every sub-team probably has a different meta prompt for how they want the crashes to be analyzed. And so we start to get to this thing where, yeah, we have this agent sitting in front of a computer, but we need to make that configurable for the team or for the user and let them... Stuff that the agent does often, we probably just want to build in as a competency that this agent has that it can do.\n\n(00:31:24):\nSo I think we end up with this generalizable thing, that you were saying, of an agent that can just write its own scripts for whatever it wants to do. But I think that the really key part here is can we make it so that everything that the agent has to do often or that it does well, we can just remember and store so that the agent doesn't have to write a script for that again? Or maybe if I just joined a team and you are already on the same team as me, I can just use all those scripts that the agents had written already.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:53):\nYeah, it's like if this is our teammate, they can share things that it's learned from working with other people at the company. It just makes sense as a metaphor.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:32:01):\nRight. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):\nIt feels like you're in the Karpathy camp of, \"Agents today are not that great and mostly slop and maybe in the future they'll be awesome.\" Does that resonate?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:32:11):\nSo I think coding agents are pretty great. I think we're seeing a ton of value there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:11):\nYeah, that feels right. That feels right, yeah.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:32:17):\nAnd then I think agents outside of coding, it's still very early. And this is just my opinion, but I think they're going to get a whole lot better once they can use coding too in a composable way. It's kind of the fun part of when you're building for software engineers, at my startup, we were building for software engineers too for a lot of that journey, and they're just such a fun audience to build for because they also like building for themselves and are often even more creative than we are in thinking about how to use the technology. So by building for software engineers, you get to just observe a ton of emergent behaviors and things that you should do and build into the product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:54):\nI love how you say that because a lot of people building for engineers get really annoyed because the engineers they're just always complaining about stuff. They're like, \"Ah, that sucks. Why'd you build it this way?\" I love that you enjoy it, but I think it's probably because you're building such an amazing tool for engineers that can actually solve problems and just code for them.\n\n(00:33:12):\nKind of along those lines, there's always this talk of what will happen with jobs, engineers, coding, do you have to learn coding? All these things. Clearly the way you're describing it is it's a teammate, it's going to work with you, make you more superhuman, it's not going to replace you. What's the way you just think about the impact on the field of engineering, having this super intelligent engineering teammate?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:33:33):\nI think there's two sides to it, but the one we were just talking about is this idea that maybe every agent should actually use code and be a coding agent.

What's the way you just think about the impact on the field of engineering, having this super intelligent engineering teammate?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:33:33):\nI think there's two sides to it, but the one we were just talking about is this idea that maybe every agent should actually use code and be a coding agent. And in my mind, that's just a small part of this broader idea that, hey, as we make code even more ubiquitous... I mean, you could probably claim it's ubiquitous today, even pre AI, right? But as we make code even more ubiquitous, it's actually just going to be used for many more purposes. And so there's just going to be a ton more need for humans with this competency.\n\n(00:34:01):\nSo that's my view. I think this is quite a complex topic. So it's something we talk about a lot and we have to see how it pans out. But I think what we can do basically as a product team building in the space is just try to always think about how are we building a tool so that it feels like we're maximally accelerating people rather than building a tool that makes it more unclear what you should do as the human?\n\n(00:34:27):\nI think, to give an example right now, nowadays when you work with a coding agent, it writes a ton of code, but it turns out writing code is actually one of the most fun parts of software engineering for many software engineers. So then you end up reviewing AI code. And that's often a less fun part of the job for many software engineers. So I actually think we see that this plays out all the time in a ton of micro decisions. So we as a product team, we're always thinking about, \"Okay, how do we make this more fun? How do we make you feel more empowered? Where is this not working?\" And I would argue that reviewing agent written code is a place that today is less fun.\n\n(00:35:04):\nSo then I think, \"Okay, what can we do about that?\" Well, we can ship a code review feature that helps you build confidence in the AI written code. Okay, cool. Another thing we could do is we can make it so that the agent's better able to validate its work. And it gets all the way down into micro decisions. If you're going to have an agent capability to validate work, and let's say you have... I'm thinking of Codex Web right now, you have a pain that sort of reflects the work the agent did, what do you see first? Do you see the diff or do you see the image preview of the code it wrote? And I think if you're thinking about this from perspective, \"How do I empower the human? How do I make them feel as accelerated as possible?\" You obviously see the image first. You shouldn't be reviewing the code unless first you've seen the image, unless maybe it's been reviewed by an AI and now it's time for you to take a look.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:49):\nWhen I had Michael Truell, the CEO of Cursor on the podcast, he had this kind of vision of us moving to something beyond code. And I've seen this rise of something called spec-driven development where you just write the spec and then the AI writes code for you. So you start working at this higher abstraction level. Is that something you see where we're going, just like engineers not having to actually write code or look at code and there's going to be this higher level of abstraction that we focus on?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:36:16):\nYeah. I mean, I think there's constantly these levels of abstraction and they're actually already played out today. Today, coding agents, mostly it's prompt to patch. We're starting to see people doing spec-driven development or planned and driven development. That's actually one of the ways when people ask, \"Hey, how do you run Codex on a really long task?\" Well, it's like often collaborate with it first to write a plan.md, like a markdown file that's your plan. And once you're happy with that, then you ask it to go off and do work. And if that plan has verifiable steps, it'll work for much longer. So we're totally seeing that.\n\n(00:36:50):\nI think spec-driven development is an interesting idea. It's not clear to me that it'll work out that way because a lot of people don't like writing specs either, but it seems plausible that some people will work that way. A bit of a joke idea though is if you think of the way that many teams work today, they often don't necessarily have specs, but the team is just really self-driven and so stuff just gets done. And so almost that it's like, I'm coming up with this on the spot, so it's not a good name, but chatter-driven development where it's just like stuff is happening on social media and in your team communications tools. And then as a result, code gets written and deployed.\n\n(00:37:29):\nSo yeah, I think I'm a little bit more oriented in that way of I don't even necessarily want to have to write a spec. Sometimes I want to, only if I like writing specs. Other times I might just want to say like, \"Hey, here's the customer service channel and tell me what's interesting to know, but if it's a small bug, just fix it.\" I don't want to have to write a spec for that, right?\n\n(00:37:51):\nI have this sort of hypothetical future that I like to share sometimes with people as a provocation, which is in a world where we have truly amazing agents, what does it look like to be a solopreneur",

And one terrible idea for how it could look is that actually there's a mobile app and every idea that the agent has to do is just vertical video on your phone and then you can swipe left if you think it's a bad idea and you can swipe right if it's a good idea. And you can press and hold and speak to your phone if you want to give feedback on the idea before you swipe. And in this world, basically what your job is is just to plug in this app into every single signal system or system of record, and then you just sit back and swipe. I don't know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:39):\nI love this. So this is like Tinder meets TikTok meets Codex.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:38:42):\nIt's pretty terrible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:43):\nNo, this is great. So the idea here is this agent is watching and listening to you, paying attention to the market, your users, and it's like, \"Cool, here's something I should do.\" It's like a proactive engineer just like, \"Here, we should build this feature, fix this thing.\"\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:38:56):\nExactly. Exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:58):\nI think it's a really good idea.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:39:00):\nCommunicating with you in the lowest effort way for your consumers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:02):\nYeah, yeah, the modern way we communicate, swipe left to right and vertical feed. And then the Sora video, okay, so I see how this all connects now. I see.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:39:11):\nYeah. To be clear, we're not building that, but it's a fun idea. I mean, in this example though, one of the things that it's doing is it's consuming external signals, right? I think the other really interesting thing is if we think about what is the most successful AI product to date, I would argue, it's funny actually not to confuse things at all, but the first time we used the brand Codex at OpenAI was actually the model powering GitHub Copilot. This is way back in the day, years ago. And so we decided to reuse that brand recently because it's just so good, Codex, code execution.\n\n(00:39:46):\nBut I think actually auto completion and IDEs is one of the most successful AI products today. And part of what's so magical about it is that when it can surface ideas for helping you really rapidly, when it's right, you're accelerated. When it's wrong, it's not that annoying. It can be annoying, but it's not that annoying. So you can create this mixed initiative system that's contextually responding to what you're attempting to do.So in my mind, this is a really interesting thing for us as OpenAI as we're building.\n\n(00:40:22):\nSo for instance, when I think about launching a browser, which we did with Atlas, in my mind, one of the really interesting things we can then do is we can then contextually surface ways that we can help you as you're going about your day. And so we break out of this, we're just looking at code or we're just in your terminal into this idea that, \"Hey, a real teammate is dealing with a lot more than just code. They're dealing with a lot of things that are web content. So how can we help you with that?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:51):\nMan, there's so much there. I love this. Okay, so auto complete on web with the browser. That's so interesting. Just like, \"Here's all the things that we can help you with as you're browsing and going about your day.\"\n\n(00:41:01):\nI want to talk about Atlas. I'll come back to that. Codex, code execution, did not know that. That's really clever. I get it now. Okay, and then this chatter, what is a chatter-driven development? No, this is a really good idea, but it reminds me, I had Dhanji on the podcast, CTO of Block, and they have this product called Goose, which is their own internal agent thing. And he talked about an engineer at Block just has Goose watch him with his screen and listens to every meeting and proactively does work that he should probably want to do. So ships to PR, sends an email, drafts a Slack message. So he's doing exactly what you're describing in kind of a very early way.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:41:45):\nYeah, that's super interesting. And I bet you, so if we went and asked them what the bottleneck to that productivity is, did they share what it is?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:54):\nProbably looking at it and just making sure this is the right thing to do, yeah.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:41:58):\nYeah. So we see this now. We have a Slack integration for Codex. People love if there's something that you need to do quickly, people will just @ mention Codex, \"Why do you think this bug is happening?\" It doesn't have to be an engineer. Even maybe data scientists often here are using Codex",

People love if there's something that you need to do quickly, people will just @ mention Codex, \"Why do you think this bug is happening?\" It doesn't have to be an engineer. Even maybe data scientists often here are using Codex a ton to just answer questions like, \"Why do you think this metric moved? What happened?\" So questions, you get the answer right back in Slack. It's amazing, super useful. But as for when it's writing code, then you have to go back and look at the code.\n\n(00:42:25):\nSo the real, I think, bottleneck right now is validating that the code worked and writing code review. So in my mind, if we wanted to get to something like the friend you were talking about's world, I think we really need to figure out how to get people to configure their coding agents to be much more autonomous on those later stages of the work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:46):\nIt makes sense. Like you said, writing code, I used to be an engineer, I was an engineer for 10 years, really fun to write code, really fun to just get in the flow, build architect, test. Not so fun to look at everyone else's code and just have to go through and be on the hook if it's doing something dumb that's going to take down production. And now that building has become easier, what I've always heard from companies that are really at the cutting edge of this is the bottleneck is now figuring out what to build. And then it's at the end of like, \"Okay, we have all this, all 100 PRs to review. Who's going to go through all that?\"\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:43:14):\nRight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:15):\nYeah.\n\n(00:43:17):\nThis episode is brought to you by Jira Product Discovery. The hardest part of building products isn't actually building products. It's everything else. It's proving that the work matters, managing stakeholders, trying to plan ahead. Most teams spend more time reacting than learning, chasing updates, justifying roadmaps, and constantly unblocking work to keep things moving. Jira Product Discovery puts you back in control. With Jira Product Discovery, you can capture insights and prioritize high impact ideas. It's flexible so it adapts to the way your team works and helps you build a roadmap that drives alignment, not questions. And because it's built on Jira, you can track ideas from strategy to delivery all in one place. Less chasing, more time to think, learn, and build the right thing. Get Jira Product Discovery for free at atlassian.com/lenny. That's atlassian.com/lenny.\n\n(00:44:08):\nWhat has the impact of Codex been on the way you operate as a product person as a PM? It's clear how engineering is impacted, code is written for you. What has it done to the way you operate and the way PMs operate at OpenAI?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:44:24):\nYeah, I mean, I think mostly I just feel much more empowered. I've always been sort of more technical leaning PM, and especially when I'm working on products for engineers, I feel like it's necessary to dogfood the product. But even beyond that, I just feel like I can do much, much more as a PM. And Scott Belsky talks about this idea of compressing the talent stack. I'm not sure if I've phrased that right. But it's basically this idea that maybe the boundaries between these roles are a little bit less needed than before because people can just do much more. And every time someone can do more, you can skip one communication boundary and make the team that much more efficient.\n\n(00:45:03):\nSo I think we see it in a bunch of functions now, but I guess since you asked about products specifically, now answering questions much, much easier. You can just ask Codex for thoughts on that. A lot of PM type work, understanding what's changing. Again, just ask Codex for help with that. Prototyping is often faster than writing specs. This is something that a lot of people have talked about.\n\n(00:45:29):\nI think something that, I don't think it's super surprising, but something that's slightly surprising is we see... We're mostly building Codex to write code that's going to be deployed to production, but actually we see a lot of throwaway code written with Codex now. It's kind of going back to this idea of ubiquitous code. So you'll see someone wants to do an analysis. If I want to understand something, it's like, okay, just give Codex a bunch of data, but then ask it to build an interactive data viewer for this data. That's just too annoying to do in the past, but now it's just totally worth the time of just getting an agent to go do something.\n\n(00:46:02):\nSimilarly, I've seen some pretty cool prototypes on our design team about if you want to... Well, a designer basically wanted to build an animation, and this is the Coin Animation Codex, and it was like normally it'd be too annoying to program this animation. So they just vibe coded a animation editor and then they use the animation editor to build the animation, which they then check into their repo.\n\n(00:46:24):\nActually, our designers, there's a ton of acceleration there. And speaking of compressing the talent stack, I think our designers are very PME. So they do a ton of product work and they actually have an entire",

    "content": "this is the Coin Animation Codex, and it was like normally it'd be too annoying to program this animation. So they just vibe coded a animation editor and then they use the animation editor to build the animation, which they then check into their repo.\n\n(00:46:24):\nActually, our designers, there's a ton of acceleration there. And speaking of compressing the talent stack, I think our designers are very PME. So they do a ton of product work and they actually have an entire vibe coded side prototype of the Codex app. And so a lot of how we talk about things is we'll have a really quick jam because there's 10,000 things going on, and then the designer will go think about how this should work. But instead of talking about it again, they'll just vibe code a prototype of that in their standalone prototype. We'll play with it. If we like it, they'll vibe engineer that prototype into an actual PR to land. And then depending on their comfort with the code base, like Codex utilizing Rust is a little harder, maybe they'll land it themselves or they'll get close and then an engineer can help them land the PR.\n\n(00:47:11):\nWe recently shipped the Sora Android app, and that was one of the most mind-blowing examples of acceleration, actually, because usage of Codex internally at OpenAI is obviously really, really high, but it's been growing over the course of the year, both in terms of now it's basically all technical staff use it, but even the intensity and know how of how to make the most of coding agents has gone up by a ton. And so the Sora Android app, a fully new app, we built it in 18 days. It went from zero to launch to employees, and then 10 days later, so 28 days total, we went to just GA, to the public, and that was done just with the help of Codex. So pretty insane velocity.\n\n(00:47:55):\nI would say it was a little bit... I don't want to say easy mode, but there is one thing that Codex is really good at if you're a company that's building software on multiple platforms, so you've already figured out some of the underlying APIs or systems, asking Codex to port things over is really effective because it has something you can go look at. And so the engineers on that team were basically having Codex go look at the iOS app, produce plans of work that needed to be done, and then go implement those. And it was looking at iOS and Android at the same time. And so basically it was two weeks to launch to employees, four weeks total. Insanely fast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:31):\nWhat makes that even more insane is it became the number one app in the app store. This just boggles the mind. Okay, so 28 days?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:48:39):\nYeah, so imagine number one app in the app store with a handful of engineers. I think it was two or three possibly in a handful of weeks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:51):\nYeah, this is absurd. Wow.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:48:56):\nYeah, so that's a really fun example of acceleration. And then Atlas was the other one that I think Ben did a podcast, the engine lead on Atlas, sharing a little bit about how we built there. Atlas is actually... I mean, it's a browser, and building a browser is really hard. So we had to build a lot of difficult systems in order to do that. And basically we got to the point where that team has a ton of power users of Codex right now, and it got to the point they where basically... We were talking to them about it, because a lot of those engineers are people I used to work with before at my startup. And so they'd say, \"Before this would've taken us two to three weeks for two to three engineers, and now it's like one engineer, one week.\" So massive acceleration there as well.\n\n(00:49:49):\nAnd what's quite cool is that we shipped Atlas on Mac first, but now we're working on the Windows version. So the team now is ramping up on Windows and they're helping us make Codex better on Windows too, which is admittedly earlier, just the model we shipped last week is the first model that natively understands PowerShell. So PowerShell being the native Shell language on Windows. So yeah, it's been really awesome to see the whole company getting accelerated by Codex from... And most obviously, also research and improving how quickly we train models and how well we do it. And then even design, as we talked about, and marketing. Actually, we're at this point now where my product marketer is often also making string changes just directly from Slack or updating docs directly from Slack.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):\nThese are amazing examples. You guys are living at the bleeding edge of what is possible, and this is how other companies are going to work. Just shipping, again, what became the number one app in the app store and just beloved all over the... It just took over, I don't know, the world for at least a week. Built, you said, in 28 days and I don't know, 10 days, 18 days just to get the core of it working.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:51:00):\nYeah, so it was like 18 days we had a thing that employees were playing with, and then 10 days later we were out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:05):\nAnd you said just a couple engineers.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:51:07):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00",

Okay. And then Atlas you said took a week to build?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:51:12):\nNo, no, no. So Atlas, not the whole week, but Atlas was a really meaty project. And so I was talking to one of the engineers on Atlas about just what they use Codex for. And it's basically like, \"We use Codex for absolutely everything.\" And I was like, \"Okay, well, how would you measure the acceleration?\" And so basically the answer I got back was, \"Previously would've taken two to three weeks for two to three engineers, and now it's like one engineer, one week.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:36):\nDo you think this eventually moves to non-engineers doing this sort of thing? Does it have to be an engineer building this thing? Could Sora have been built by, I don't know, a PM or designer?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:51:45):\nI think we will very much get to the point, well, basically where the boundaries are a little bit blurred. I think you're going to want someone who understands the details of what they're building, but what details those are will evolve. Kind of like how now if you're writing Swift, you don't have to speak assembly. There's a handful of people in the world, and it's really important that they exist and speak assembly, maybe more than a handful, but that's a specialized function that most companies don't need to have.\n\n(00:52:14):\nSo I think we're just going to naturally see an increase in layers of abstraction. And then the cool thing is now we're entering the language layer of abstraction, like natural language, and then natural language itself is really flexible. You could have engineers talking about a plan and then you could have engineers talking about a spec, and then you could have engineers talking about just a product or an idea. So I think we can also start moving up those layers of abstraction as well.\n\n(00:52:39):\nBut I do think this is going to be gradual. I don't think it's going to go off to all of a sudden nobody ever writes anything, any code and it's just specs. I think it's going to be much more like, \"Okay, we've set up our coding agent to be really good at previewing the build or at running tests,\" maybe that's the first part that most people have set up. And it's like, \"Okay, now we've set it up so they can execute the build and it can see the results of its own changes, but we haven't yet built a good integration harness so that it can,\" in the case of Atlas... By the way, I don't know if they've done any of this or not. I think they've done a lot of this. But maybe the next stage is enable it to load a few sample pages to see how well those work. So then, okay, now we're going to set it up to do that.\n\n(00:53:18):\nAnd I think for some time at least, we're going to have humans curating which of these connectors or systems or components that the agent needs to be good at talking to. And then in the future, there will be an even greater unlock where Codex tells you how to set it up or maybe sets itself up in a repo.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:34):\nWhat a wild time to be alive. Wow. I'm curious just the second order effects of this sort of thing, just how quickly it is to build stuff. What does that do? Does that mean distribution becomes much, much more important? Does it mean ideas are just worth a lot more? It's interesting to think about how quick how that changes.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:53:51):\nI'm curious what you think. I still don't think ideas are worth as much as maybe a lot of people think. I still think execution is really hard. You can build something fast, but you still need to execute well on it, still needs to make sense and be a coherent thing overall, yeah, and distribution is massive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):\nYeah. Just feels like everything else is now more important. Everything that isn't the building piece, which is coming up with an idea, getting to market, profit, all that kind of stuff.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:54:18):\nYeah. I think we might've been in this weird temporary phase where, for a while, it was so hard to build product that you mostly just had to be really good at building product and it maybe didn't matter if you had an intimate understanding of a specific customer. But now I think we're getting to this point where actually if I could only choose one thing to understand, it would be really meaningful understanding of the problems that a certain customer has. If I could only go in with one core competency.\n\n(00:54:52):\nSo I think that's ultimately still what's going to matter most. If you're starting a new company today and you have a really good understanding and network of customers that are currently underserved by AI tools, I think you're set. Whereas if you're good at building websites, but you don't have any specific customer to build for, I think you're in for a much harder time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55",

Whereas if you're good at building websites, but you don't have any specific customer to build for, I think you're in for a much harder time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:14):\nBullish on vertical AI startups is what I'm hearing. Yeah, I completely agree. There's the general thing that can solve a lot of problems and then there's like, \"We're going to solve presentations incredibly well and we're going to understand the presentation problem better than anyone and we're going to plug into your workflows and all these other things that matter for a very specific problem.\" Okay, incredible.\n\n(00:55:36):\nWhen you think about progress on Codex, I imagine you have a bunch of evals and there's all these public benchmarks. What's something you look at to tell you, \"Okay, we're making really good progress,\" I imagine it's not going to be the one thing, but what do you focus on? What's something you're trying to push? What's a KPI or two?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:55:51):\nOne of the things that I'm constantly reminding myself of is that a tool like Codex naturally is a tool that you would become a power user of. So we can accidentally spend a lot of our time thinking about features that are very deep in the user adoption journey. And so we can kind of end up oversolving for that. And so I think it's just critically important to go look at your D7 retention. Just go try the product, sign up from scratch again. I have a few too many ChatGPT Pro accounts that I've, in order to maximally correctly dogfood, signed up for on my Gmail and they charge me 200 bucks a month. I need to expense those. But I think just the feeling of being end user and the early retention stats are still super important for us because as much as this category is taking off, I think we're still in the very early days of people using them.\n\n(00:56:44):\nAnother thing that we do that I think we might be the most user feedback/social media pilled team out there in this space is like a few of us are constantly on Reddit and Twitter, and there's praise up there and there's a lot of complaints, but we take the complaints very seriously and look at them. And I think that, again, because you can use a coding agent for so many different things, it often is kind of broken in many sort of ways for specific behaviors. So we actually monitor a lot just what the vibes are on social media pretty often, especially I think for Twitter/X, it's a little bit more hypey and then Reddit is a little more negative but real actually. So I've started increasingly paying attention to how people are talking about using Codex on Reddit actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:39):\nThis is important for people to know. Which of the subreddits do you check most? Is there like an r/Codex or?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:57:44):\nI mean, the algorithm's pretty good at surfacing stuff, but r/Codex is there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:48):\nOkay. I'll take. Very interesting. And then if people tag you on Twitter, you still see that, but maybe not as powerful as seeing it on Reddit.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:57:56):\nWell, yeah. Well, the thing with Twitter is it's a little bit more one-to-one, even if it's in public. Whereas with Reddit, those are really good upvoting mechanics and maybe most people are still not bots, unclear. So you get good signal on what matters and what other people think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:09):\nSo interestingly, Atlas, I want to talk about that briefly. You guys launched Atlas. I tweeted actually that I tried Atlas and then I don't love the AI only search experience. I was just like, \"I just want Google sometimes,\" or whatever. Just waiting for AI to give me an answer, I'm like, \"I don't want to... \" And there was no way to switch. I just tweeted, \"Hey, I'm switching back. It's not great.\" And I feel like I made some PMs at OpenAI sad. And I saw someone tweet, \"Okay, we have Atlas now,\" which I imagine was always part of the plan. It's probably an example of just, \"We got to ship stuff, see how people use it and then we figure it out.\" So I guess one is that, I don't know, is there anything there? And two, I'm just curious, why are you guys building a web browser?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:58:48):\nSo I worked on Atlas for a bit. I don't work on it now. But a bit of the narrative here for me just to tell my story a bit was I was working on this screen sharing, pair programming startup, and then we joined OpenAI. And so the idea was really to build a contextual desktop assistant. And the reason I believe that's so important is because I think that it's really annoying to have to give all your context to an assistant and then to figure out how it can help you. So if it could just understand what you are trying to do, then it could maximally accelerate you. So I still think of Codex actually as a contextual assistant from a little bit of a different angle, starting with coding tasks.\n\n(00:59:30):\nBut some of the thinking, at least for me personally,",

So I still think of Codex actually as a contextual assistant from a little bit of a different angle, starting with coding tasks.\n\n(00:59:30):\nBut some of the thinking, at least for me personally, I can't speak for the whole project, was that a lot of work is done in the web. And if we could build a browser, then we could be contextual for you, but in a much more first class way. We weren't hacking other desktop software which have very varied support for what content they're rendering to the accessibility tree. We wouldn't be relying on screenshots, which are a little bit slower and unreliable. Instead, we could be In the rendering engine and extract whatever we needed to help you. And also I like to think of video games, I don't know if you've played, I don't know, say Halo, you walk up to an object, I mean, this is true for many games, you press... Man, it's been a long time, this is embarrassing. Press X and it just does the right thing. And I was one of those guys who always read the instruction manual for every video game that I bought.\n\n(01:00:24):\nAnd I remember the first time I read about a contextual action and I just thought it was this really cool idea. And the thing about a contextual action is we need to know what you are attempting to do. We have a little bit of context and then we can help. And I think this is critically important because imagine this world that we reach where we have agents that are helping you thousands of times per day.\n\n(01:00:49):\nImagine if the only way we could tell you that we helped you was if we could push notify you. So you get a thousand push notifications a day of an AI saying like, \"Hey, I did this thing. Do you like it? \" It'd be super annoying, right? Whereas imagine, going back to software engineering, I was looking at a dashboard and I noticed some key metric had gone down. And at that point in time, an AI could maybe go take a look and then surface the fact that it has an opinion on why this metric went down and maybe a fix right there right when I'm looking at the dashboard. That would much more keep me in flow and enable the agent to take action on many more things.\n\n(01:01:26):\nSo in my mind, part of why I'm excited for us to have a browser is that I think we have then much more context around what we should help with. Users have much more control over what they want us to look at. It's like, \"Hey, if you want us to take action on something, you can open it in your AI browser. If you don't, then you can open it in your other browser.\" So really clear control and boundaries. And then we have the ability to build UX that's mixed initiatives so that we can surface contextual actions to you at the time that they're helpful as opposed to just randomly notifying you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:58):\nHearing the vision for Codex being the super assistant, it's not just there to code for you. It's trying to do a lot for you as a teammate, as this kind of super teammate, and that makes you awesome at work. So I get this. Speaking of that, are there other non-engineering common use cases for Codex? Just ways that non-engineers... We talked about designers prototyping and building stuff, are there any fun or unexpected ways people are using Codex that aren't engineers?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:02:24):\nI mean, there's a load of unexpected ways, but I think most of where we're seeing real traction with people using things are still for now very, I would say, coding adjacent or tech-oriented, places where there's a mature ecosystem or maybe you're doing data analysis or something like that. I personally am expecting that we're going to see a lot more of that over time. But for now, we're keeping the team very focused on just coding for now because there's so much more work to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:54):\nFor people that are thinking about trying out Codex, does it work for all kinds of code bases? What code does it support? If you're like, I don't know, SAP, can you add Codex and start building things? What's the sweet spot? Where does it start to not be amazing yet?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:03:11):\nI'm really glad you asked this question actually because the best way to try Codex is to give it your hardest tasks, which is a little different than some of the other coding agents. Some tools you might think, \"Okay, let me start easy or just vibe code something random and decide if I like the tool.\" Whereas we're really building Codex to be the professional tool that you can give your hardest problems to. And that writes high quality code in your enormous code base that is in fact not perfect right now. So yeah, I think if you're going to try Codex, you want to try it on a real task that you have and not necessarily dumb that task down to something that's trivial, but actually a good one would be you have a hard bug and you don't know what's causing that bug and you ask Codex to help figure that out or to implement that the fix.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:00):\nI love that answer. Just give it to your hardest problem.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:04:03):\nI will say if you're like,",

Just give it to your hardest problem.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:04:03):\nI will say if you're like, \"Hey, okay, well, the hardest problem I have is that I need to build a new unicorn business,\" obviously that's not going to work. Not yet. So I think it's like give it the hardest problem, but something that is still one question or one task to start. That's if you're testing and then over time you can learn how to use it for bigger things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:25):\nYeah. What languages does it support?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:04:27):\nBasically, the way we've trained Codex is there's a distribution of languages that we support and it's fairly aligned with the frequency of these languages in the world. So unless you're writing some very esoteric language or some private language, it should do fine in your language.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:41):\nIf someone was just getting started, is there a tip you could share to help them be successful? If you could just whisper a little tip into someone just setting up Codex for the first time to help them have a really good time, what's something you would whisper?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:04:54):\nI might say try a few things in parallel. So you could try giving it a hard task, maybe ask it to understand the code base, formulate a plan with it around an idea that you have and kind of build your way up from there. And the meta idea here is, again, it's like you're building trust with a new teammate. And so you wouldn't go to a new teammate and just give them like, \"Hey, do this thing. Here's zero context.\" You would start by first making sure they understand the code base and then you would maybe align on an approach and then you would have them go off and do bit by bit. And I think if you use Codex in that way, you'll just naturally start to understand the different ways of prompting it because it's a super powerful agent and model, but it is a little bit different to prompt Codex than other models.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:38):\nJust a couple more questions. One, we touched on this a little bit, as AI does more and more coding, there's always this question of, \"Should I learn to code and why should I spend time doing this sort of thing?\" For people that are trying to figure out what to do with their career, especially if they're into software engineering computer science, do you think there's specific elements of computer science that are more and more important to lean into, maybe things they don't need to worry about? What do you think people should be leaning into skill-wise as this becomes more and more of a thing in our workplace?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:06:11):\nI think there's a couple angles you could go at this from. Well, the easiest one to think of at least is just be a doer of things. I think that with coding agents getting better and better over time, it's just what you can do as even someone in college or a new grad is just so much more than what that was before. And so I think you just want to be taking advantage of that. And definitely when I'm looking at hiring folks who are earlier career, it's definitely something that I think about is how productive are they using the latest tools? They should be super productive. And if you think of it in that way, they actually have less of a handicap than before versus a more senior career person because the divide is actually getting smaller because they've got these amazing coding agents now. So that's one thing, which is, I guess the advice is just learn about whatever you want, but just make sure you spend time doing things, not just fulfilling homework assignments, I guess.\n\n(01:07:11):\nI think the other side of it though is that it's still deeply worth understanding what makes a good overall software system. So I still think that skills, like really strong systems engineering skills, or even really effective communication and collaboration with your team, skills like that I think are important or are going to continue to matter for quite some time. I don't think it's going to be all of a sudden the AI coding agents are just able to build perfect systems without your help. I think it's going to look much more gradual where it's like, okay, we have these AI coding agents, they're able to validate their work. It's still important.\n\n(01:07:51):\nFor example, I'm thinking of an engineer who was working on Atlas, since we were talking about it, he set up Codex so that it can verify its own work, which is a little bit non-trivial because of the nature of the Atlas project. So the way that he did that was he actually prompted Codex like, \"Hey, why can't you verify your work? Fix it,\" and did that on a loop. And so you still, at various phases, are going to want a human in the loop to help configure the coding agent to be effective. So I think you still want to be able to reason about that. So maybe it's less important that you can type really fast and you understand exactly how to write... Not that anyone writes a 4H loop or something, or you don't need to know how to implement a specific algorithm. But I think you need to be able to reason about the different systems and what makes a software engineering team",

But I think you need to be able to reason about the different systems and what makes a software engineering team effective. So I think that's the other really important thing.\n\n(01:08:40):\nThen maybe the last angle that you could take is, I think if you're on the frontier of knowledge for a given thing, I still think that's deeply interesting to go down, partially because that knowledge is still going to be... Agents aren't going to be as good at that, but also partially because I think that by trying to advance the frontier of a specific thing, you'll actually end up being forced to take advantage of coding agents and using them to accelerate your own workflow as you go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:09):\nWhat's an example that when you talk about being at the frontier of something?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:09:12):\nCodex writes a lot of the code that helps manage its training runs, the key infrastructure. We move pretty fast and so we have a Codex code review is catching a lot of mistakes. It's actually cause some pretty interesting configuration mistakes. And we're starting to see glimpses of the future where we're actually starting to have Codex even be on call for its own training, which is pretty interesting. So there's lots there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:38):\nWait, what does that mean to be on call for its own training? So it's running, it's training and it's like, \"Oh, something broke, someone needs...\" And does it alert people or it's like, \"Here, I'm going to fix the problem and restart\"?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:09:47):\nThis is an early idea that we're figuring out. But the basic idea is that during a training run, there's a bunch of graphs that today humans are looking at and it's really important to look at those. We call this babysitting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:59):\nBecause it's very expensive to train, I imagine, and very important to move fast and-\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:10:03):\nExactly. And there's a lot of systems underlying the training run. And so a system could go down or there could be an error somewhere that gets introduced. And so we might need to fix it or pause things or, I don't know, there's lots of actions we might need to take. And so basically having Codex run on a loop to evaluate how those charts are moving over time is this idea that we have to how to enable us to train way more efficiently.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:26):\nI love that. And this is very much along the lines of this is the future of agents. Codex isn't just for building code, it's a lot more than that.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:10:34):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):\nOkay, last question. Being at OpenAI, I can't not ask about your AGI timeline and how far you think we are from AGI. I know this isn't what you work on, but there's a lot of opinions, a lot of, I don't know, timelines. How far do you think we are from a humanly human version of AI, whatever that means to you?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:10:56):\nFor me, I think that it's a little bit about when do we see the acceleration curves go like this? Or I don't know which way I'm mirrored here. When do we see the hockey stick? And I think that the current limiting factor, I mean, there's many, but I think a current underappreciated limiting factor is literally human typing speed or human multitasking speed on writing prompts. And like you were talking about, it's like you can have an agent watch all the work you're doing, but if you don't have the agent also validating its work, then you're still bottlenecked on can you go review all that code?\n\n(01:11:29):\nSo my view is that we need to unblock those productivity loops from humans having to prompt and humans having to manually validate all the work. So if we can rebuild systems to let the agent be default useful, we'll start unlocking hockey sticks. Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to be binary. I think it's going to be very dependent on what you're building. So I would imagine that next year, if you're a startup and you're building new pieces, like some new app or something, it'll be possible for you to set it up on a stack where agents are much more self-sufficient than not. But now let's say, I don't know, you mentioned SAP, let's say you work in SAP, they have many complex systems and they're not going to be able to just get the agent to be self-sufficient overnight in those systems. So they're going to have to slowly maybe replace systems or update systems to allow the agent to handle more of the work end to end.\n\n(01:12:22):\nSo basically my long answer to your question, maybe boring answer is that I think starting next year, we're going to see early adopters starting to hockey stick their productivity. And then over the years that follow, we're going to see larger and larger companies like hockey stick that productivity. And then somewhere in that fuzzy middle is when that hockey sticking will be flowing back into the AI labs and that's when we'll basically be at the AGI tier.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:48",

It's very practical and it's something that comes up a lot on this podcast. Just like the time to reveal all the things AI is doing is really annoying and a big bottleneck. I love that you're working on this because it's one thing to just make coding much more efficient and do that for people. It's another to take care of that final step of, \"Okay, is this actually great?\" And that's so interesting that your sense is that's the limiting factor. It comes back to your earlier point of even if AI did not advance anymore, we have so much more potential to unlock as we learn to use it more effectively. So that is a really unique answer. I haven't heard that perspective on what is the big unlock. Human typing speed to review basically what AI is doing for us. So good.\n\n(01:13:31):\nOkay, Alexander, we covered a lot of ground. Is there anything that we haven't covered? Is there anything you wanted to share, maybe double down on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:13:43):\nI think one thing is that the Codex team is growing. And as I was just saying, we're still somewhat limited by human thinking speed and human typing speed. We're working on it. So if you're an engineer or a salesperson, or I'm hiring a product person, please hit us up. I'm not sure the best way to give contact info, but I guess you can go to our jobs page, or do they have contact for you actually? Do listeners have contact for you?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:10):\nWhere they send me like, \"Hey, I want to apply to Codex\"? I do have a contact form at lennyrachitsky.com. I'm afraid of all the amazing people that are going to ping me. But there we go, we could try that. Let's see how that goes.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:14:20):\nOkay. Or maybe an easier version, we can edit all that out or up to you. Yeah, or I would just say you can drop us a DM. For example, I'm Embirico on Twitter, and hit me up if you're interested in joining the team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:33):\nWhat a dream job for so many people. What's a sign they... I don't know, what's a way to filter people a little bit so they're not flooding your inbox?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:14:42):\nSo specifically if you want to join the Codex team, then you need to be a technical person who uses these tools. And I think I would just ask yourself the question, \"Hey, let's say I were to join OpenAI and work on Codex over the next six months and crush it, what does the life of a software engineer look like then?\" And I think if you have an opinion on that, you should apply. And if you don't have an opinion on that and have to think about it first, depending on how long you have to think about it, I guess that would be the filter. I think there's a lot of people thinking about this space. So we're very interested in folks who have already been thinking about what the future should look like with agents. And we don't have to agree on where we're going, but I think we want people who are very passionate about the topic, I guess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):\nIt's very rare to be working on a product that has this much impact and is at such a bleeding edge of where it's possible. What a cool role for the right person. So it's awesome that you have an opening and this audience is a really good fit potentially for that role. So I hope we find someone, that would be incredible. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you, Alexander. Are you ready?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:15:54):\nI don't know what these are, but I'm excited. Let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:57):\nThey're the same questions I ask everyone except for the last one. So probably not a surprise. I should probably make them more often a surprise. Okay, first question, what are a couple of books that you recommend most to other people, two or three books that come to mind?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:16:12):\nI have been reading a lot of science fiction recently, and I'm sure this has been recommended before, but The Culture, I think it's Ian Banks is the name of the author. Part of why I love it is because it's basically relatively recent writing about a future with AI, but it's an optimistic future with AI. And I think a lot of sci-fi is fairly dystopian. But the joke, at least on The Culture subreddit is that, let me see if I can get this right, it is a space communist utopia, or I think it's a gay space communist utopia. And I just think it's really fun to think about, to use The Culture as a way to think about what kind of world can we usher in and what decisions can we make today to help usher in that world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:02):\nWow. I don't think anyone's recommended",

I don't think anyone's recommended that. I know you're reading, you've mentioned before I start recording, Lord of the Rings right now. If you want another AI-ish sci-fi book, have you read Fire Upon the Deep?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:17:15):\nNo, I haven't.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:15):\nOkay, it's incredibly good. It's like a sci-fi space opera sort of epic tale with super intelligence.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:17:25):\nCool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:25):\nYeah. Mostly not optimistic, but somewhat optimistic.\n\n(01:17:30):\nOkay, next question. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:17:36):\nYeah, there's an anime called Jujutsu Kaisen, which I really like. Again, it's got a slightly dark topic of demons. But what I love about it is that the hero is really nice. And I think there's this new wave of anime and cartoons where the protagonists are really friendly and people who care about the world rather than being sort of, if you look at some older anime that started the genre, there's Evangelion or Akita and those characters, the protagonists are deeply flawed, quite unhappy. They didn't start the genre, but it was a trend for a while to poke fun at the idea that in these cartoons the protagonist was very young, but being given a ridiculous amount of responsibility to save the world. So there was kind of a wave of content that was critiquing this by making the character basically go through serious mental issues in the middle of the show. And I'm not saying this is better, but at least it's quite fun to have these really positive protagonists are just trying to help everyone around them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:43):\nI love how much we're learning about your personality hearing these recommendations. Nice protagonists, optimistic futures. I like the [inaudible 01:18:53].\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:18:53):\nI think if you don't believe it, you can't will it into existence. So you need a balance.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:57):\nThis is your training data.\n\n(01:18:59):\nIs there a product you recently discovered you really love? Could be an app, could be some clothing, could be some kitchen gadget, tech gadget, a hat.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:19:09):\nYeah, so I have been quite into combustion engines and cars. Actually, the reason I came to America initially was because I wanted to work on US aircraft, but now I work in software. And so for the longest time, I've basically only had quite old sports cars, old just because they were more affordable. And then recently we got a Tesla instead. And I have to say that I find the Tesla software quite inspiring. In particular, it has the self-driving feature. And I've mentioned a few times today, I think it's really interesting to think about how to build mixed initiative software that makes you feel maximally empowered as a human, maximally in control, but yet you're getting a lot of help. And I think they did a really good job with enabling the car to drive itself, but all these different ways that you can adjust what it's doing without turning off the self-driving. So you can accelerate, it'll listen to that. You can turn a knob to change its speed. You can steer slightly. I think it's actually a masterclass in building an agent that still leaves the human in control.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:21):\nThis reminds me Nick Turley's whole mantra is, \"Are we maximally accelerated?\"\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:20:26):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):\nFeels like it's completely infiltrated everything at OpenAI, which makes sense, that tracks.\n\n(01:20:32):\nTwo more questions. Do you have a life motto that you often think about and come back to in work or in life that's been helpful?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:20:39):\nI don't know if I have a life motto, but maybe I can tell you about the number one company value from my startup.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:45):\nLove it.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:20:46):\nWhich is still something that sticks with me, which is to be kind and candid.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:51):\nThat tracks. Kind and candid. Wow, that's a great combo.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:20:54):\nYeah. And we had to put them together because we, as founders, realized that we often would be nice and it wasn't actually the right thing to do. We would delay the difficult conversations and we were not candid. And so every time we would remind ourselves of this motto and then we would become more candid. And then six months later, we would realize that we were in fact not candid six months ago and we needed to be even more candid. So then the question is like, \"Okay, how should we be candid?\" It's like, \"Okay, well, let's think of being candid as an act of kindness,\" but also think of that both",

What's the book about challenge directly but care deeply? Radical Candor.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:21:43):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:44):\nSo it's like another way of thinking about Radical Candor.\n\n(01:21:46):\nOkay, last question. I was looking up your last name just like, \"Hey, what's the story here?\" So your last name is Embiricos, and I was talking at ChatGPT and it told me the most famous individuals with the surname are the influential Greek poet and psychoanalyst Andreas Embiricos and his relative, the wealthy shipping magnate and art collector, George Embiricos. So the question is, which of these two do you most identify with, the Greek poet and psychoanalyst or the wealthy shipping magnate and art collector?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:22:19):\nI think it's going to have to be the poet because he loved the island that our family's from.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:27):\nWait, you know those people? Okay, this is not news to you. Okay.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:22:30):\nWell, I mean, it's an enormous family. But it's like Greek, so these big families, everyone's your uncle.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:30):\nLove this. Okay.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:22:36):\nYou know what I mean? My mother's Malaysian and also everyone is my uncle or aunt in Malaysia too, if that makes sense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:42):\nYeah.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:22:43):\nBut yeah, he loved this island that the family initiated from. I believe, I don't actually know where that's shipping magnate lived, I think it was New York or something. But anyway, we all came from this island called Andros, which is a really beautiful place. And it's like there's more livestock there than humans. Not too many tourists go there. But I think part of what I think is really cool is he published a lot and a lot of his writing is about the beauty of that island, which I think is super cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:12):\nWow, that was an amazing answer.\n\n(01:23:14):\nTwo more questions, where can folks find you if they want to follow you online and maybe reach out? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:23:20):\nI'm one of those people who has social media only for the purposes of having work. My phone turns black and white at 9:00 PM at night. But yeah, so Twitter or X, @Embirico. And yeah, if you post in r/Codex, I'll probably see it. So you can go there.\n\n(01:23:40):\nHow can listeners be useful? I would say please try Codex, please share feedback, let us know what to improve. We pay a ton of attention to feedback. I think, honestly, the growth has been amazing, but it's still very early times, so we still pay a lot of attention and hope to do so forever. And also, I would say if you're interested in working on the future of coding agents and then agents generally, then please apply to our job site and/or message me in those social media places.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:10):\nAlexander, this was awesome. I always love meeting people working on AI because it always feels like this very, I don't know, sterile, scary, mysterious thing. And then you meet the people building these tools and they're always just so awesome, and you especially, just so nice. And like the examples you shared, optimism and kindness, this is what we want to be. These are the kinds of people we want to be building these tools that are going to drive the future. So I'm really thankful that you did this. I'm grateful to have met you, and thank you so much for being here.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:24:45):\nYeah, thanks so much for having me. This was fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:48):\nThank you so much for listening.

It's really important to me that you're able to succeed in your career here, and so I want to continue to help you find opportunities to build your skills and to advance.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):\nYou're big on helping leaders understand that their job is not to make employees happy.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:00:29):\nThey're trying now to be the leader who everyone loves, but what really needs to happen very often is, we need to drive towards results. This employee continuing to not really do a great job at their job, you don't want to push them because you don't want to upset them. You don't want to give them difficult feedback, so you're just going to keep hoping it works out. Ultimately, that leads to the demise of your company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):\nYou have some cool advice on just how to make meetings more effective and how to especially end the meeting.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:00:54):\nMy three questions to end the meeting are...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):\nToday my guest is Alisa Cohn. Alisa is an executive coach who has worked with C-suite execs at both startups like Etsy, Wirecutter, Venmo, and DraftKings, along with Fortune 500 companies like Microsoft, Google, Pfizer, and the New York Times. She was named one of the top 50 coaches in the world by Thinkers50 and the number one startup coach for the past four years by Global Gurus. What I love about Alisa is that she gives her clients very specific and actionable advice. In her conversation, Alisa shares specific language and phrases that you can use when having a difficult conversation with your reports to make these conversations go much smoother and be less difficult. Also, three questions you should ask at the end of every meeting to make the most possible forward progress after each meeting. Plus, why your job as a leader isn't to make people happy and what you should be focused on instead, and a set of questions that she calls the founder prenup that you should talk through with potential founders to make sure that these are the people that you want to be working with for a long, long time.\n\n(00:01:59):\nThere's also so much more advice.

Alisa, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:04:54):\nLenny, it's so great to be here and thanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):\nI want to dive right into talking about your advice on having difficult conversations. I personally dread difficult conversations. I feel like I practice ahead of these things. I'm like, \"I'm going to say these things. It's going to go like this,\" and it never goes as well as I hope. I always say the wrong thing. I feel like this is very relatable. They're called difficult conversations for a reason.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:05:18):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:19):\nI know you work with a lot of execs on this specifically, and what I love is you've actually come up with a bunch of scripts that help people make these conversations less difficult. So how about we talk through some of these scripts that people can actually start applying?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:05:32):\nLet's do that. I love that idea. And also Lenny, as you just said, very relatable and also, so you're not alone. If I could ask you a question, if you're picturing a difficult conversation that you have had, should have, might have, and you're nervous about, it's hard for you, can you sum it up? What's hard about it? Because it's helpful to clarify what is hard about it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:56):\nGreat question. I just don't want to make people sad and upset, and I worry about their reaction, how to deal with that, and them just getting really upset and mad and just like, \"Oh, man. This really made things worse.\" So I worry about the reaction, I guess.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:06:11):\nOkay, about making things worse or about their reaction?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:13):\nThe reaction, just making someone upset and sad. I don't want to do that.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:06:17):\nMaking someone upset. Okay, good. And again, you're not alone about that. Just one more question on that. What's the problem if they're sad and upset? What does that mean to you?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:26):\nOh, I love this life coaching we're doing. Yeah, so it's like what happens if they get sad and upset?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:06:33):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:36):\nI feel like it's stuff that I'm going to have to deal with. It's like this drama all of a sudden, this new fire I have to think about. And yeah, it's like the additional work it creates and also just, I don't know. Yeah, it's a good question.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:06:48):\nYou can think about it some more, right? I'm not going to put you on the spot right now, but just to say for all of us, the reason they're difficult, to your point, they're difficult. But we're putting meaning on things all the time, every day, all the time, and I think it's important, it's actually helpful in motivating you to have difficult conversations, but also in helping them go well. If you can get to the bottom of what you're putting on top of it, what you're weighting it with, because I can understand that again, you are not alone. I don't want to make people upset. Totally.\n\n(00:07:20):\nAnd also, I would just say on the other hand, when you're enlightening someone or you're working out a situation with someone and it's difficult, if you don't give them the opportunity to hear what you have to say, if you don't bring this up, then you're never going to have the opportunity to help them see something differently or help them improve or help you improve the relationship or whatever it is you're trying to do. And so, I can understand it's a natural thing. I don't want to make them upset.\n\n(00:07:51):\nNo one wants to make anybody upset, but through that upset on the other side of that, can often be a whole new possibility and a whole new revelation, and actually a lot of joy and freedom. I think that we forget about all the other possibilities that come out of difficult conversations and we just land on these really uncomfortable parts about like, \"oh, it's going to be a lot of extra work\" or like, \"They're going to get uncomfortable or even maybe cry.\" And I think it's just really helpful to tap into what you make it mean and then also what other possibilities it could mean.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:23):\nI love that. And it's one thing to hear that and say that, it's another to actually feel that deeply and feel like I shouldn't be as worried as I am. I think part of it is doing these enough times where you're like, \"Okay, it's actually not so hard.\" And the other is having some of this support. To make this even more real, let's give some examples of what we say when we say difficult conversations. There's like, \"You're not getting a promotion that you thought you would, we're going to let you go.\" What other examples or common difficult conversations that",

To make this even more real, let's give some examples of what we say when we say difficult conversations. There's like, \"You're not getting a promotion that you thought you would, we're going to let you go.\" What other examples or common difficult conversations that you run across?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:08:50):\nThose are two very common ones. And then of course, the most common one is just difficult performance feedback. Or [inaudible 00:08:56] what we say, quote unquote, \"constructive performance feedback,\" which we never made positive. It only is the sort of things that you're not doing well. I think there are two flavors of that. One is, \"You're screwing up\" and the other is, \"Developmentally, I'd like to see you add something or change something.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:12):\nYes. And as you say that, one of the other fears I have is them just disagreeing and me feeling like maybe it's not right, maybe I'm wrong and feeling shit maybe. I didn't see something and then just looking worse after the whole thing.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:09:27):\nYeah. And so then I think what's also really helpful to, and part of the process that we can talk about this for sure is getting a difficult conversation is number one, tapping into what's uncomfortable for it, for you, about it. And then number two, also getting your mindset right. So to say the obvious, are you doing this to hurt someone's feelings? No, never, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:49):\nThe opposite.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:09:50):\nThat's not the reason that anyone's doing it. Sometimes people are giving the performance feedback or talking about something that's been bothering them in order to express themselves and vent. And actually, that is very helpful to identify for yourself, that's why I'm doing it. And then, maybe not do it then, until you can transform your reasoning. But at the end of the day, the hope is as a manager, the reason that you're giving someone this so-called constructive feedback is because you're helping them get better. You need them to change the behavior. They'll never get promoted if they keep doing that. They'll never be successful if they keep doing that. And so, it's your job as a leader and as a manager, to help them out of that problem and help them do something different.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:33):\nThe best story I've heard to make that really real for me, I think it was Kim Scott when she came on the podcast. She told a story of, I think it was Bob, where everyone just knew he was terrible and it was like, everyone's was just like knew he was not good and eventually, the boss had a conversation with him eight months into it and told him, \"It's not going to work out. You're just doing a bad job.\" And he's like, \"Why didn't anyone tell me? I didn't realize that. If you told me, I would've changed.\" And everyone assumed he knew. And so I think to your point, this is to help the person. It's not not to hurt them.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:11:05):\nYeah, a hundred percent. One of my clients, he was running a division and one of his people was not doing it right, not doing it right, not getting the right kind of data, not having to do the right kind of analysis, whatever it was. We were talking about it and I said, \"Well, how come you have another feedback with her?\" And he said, \"You know, she's just going to cry. She's just going to cry. She's older, whatever, she's just going to cry. It's going to be too uncomfortable, whatever.\" So we worked, we talked and talked and talked. I gave him a script. We really worked it out and he agreed that he would go in and have that conversation with her, which he did.\n\n(00:11:40):\nAnd he reported back to me and he was shaken. She cried. Of course she did. She cried. That's what he knew she was going to do. And so she was upset and she went home early and the whole thing. The next day she came in and she said, \"Thank you so much for telling me that. I wish someone had told me that 15 years ago. I think I could have had a different career.\" And I think that is so meaningful for all leaders and people who are responsible for other people to understand that you're uncomfortable when they start crying, of course, or they have this difficult reaction or whatever. But honestly, the only way you're going to be able to help someone grow in their career and become the best person they can be is by leaning into these tough conversations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:23):\nWhat I love about the scripts we're going to talk about, which we probably should transition to, is it's again, one thing to hear that and be like, \"Yes, okay, I need to do this. I need to get better at typical conversations. I need to have that talk without someone that we should let go.\" It's another when it's like tomorrow is the meeting and you're like, \"Oh, my God. I have to have this conversation now.\" And so, I love that you actually give people a really simple approach to how to lay this stuff out in various different contexts. So let's talk through some of these approaches and scripts you've come up with",

I have to have this conversation now.\" And so, I love that you actually give people a really simple approach to how to lay this stuff out in various different contexts. So let's talk through some of these approaches and scripts you've come up with. What do you think would be a good one to start with?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:12:55):\nWell, we can start with performance feedback and we can just sort of take a typical example. So first of all, once you've done your work to get your mindset right to kind of know what you're doing it, and then you just really want to really be able to wrap your mouth around the words. So what that looks like is practicing, and the script could be, \"You know, Matilda, I want to chat with you about the way you're interacting with your peers. So what I'm hearing from them is that you're missing deadlines on a regular basis and not letting them know you're missing the deadlines, and that also you're not fully keeping your team up to speed.\n\n(00:13:27):\nAnd so they're kind of confused running around. Now, we both know that the most important way you can be successful here and also achieve your goals is to make sure that you are working with your peers in a way that's consistent and that they can count on you and you can count on them. So I wanted to let you know about this. I want to certainly hear what you have to say, but the most important thing is that we leave this discussion knowing how you're going to make sure that you're keeping your peers in the loop and also your team in the loop.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:55):\nYeah, there's so many elements there that are really interesting. Just focusing on what I'm hearing versus just coming from you or something you've done wrong. It's, here's what I'm hearing from multiple sources. I think that helps people. Okay, it's not just you and just like, \"Oh, my manager hates me.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:13:56):\nRight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:14):\nIt's like, \"Okay, other people are saying this.\" And then I love this phrase of, we both know where it's not just me telling you this. It's like, \"You also know this. I know you're smart and you also know that this is, something is wrong here.\" And then this goal of, here's what we need to [inaudible 00:14:31]. You're like very clear call to action, almost action item, like leave this meeting with, \"Let's just be aligned on this thing.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:14:36):\nYeah, thanks for calling those out. I hope, and again, what I'm trying to convey in my tone is also, \"You know what? It's Tuesday. We got to have this conversation. I'm sure it's going to end well. I'm not mad.\" The whole point about my manager hates me, right? \"I'm not yelling at you.\" The more even keeled and even matter of fact you can be about something that's kind of just run-of-the-mill feedback, the better. And I think it's just also what I didn't say before, and I think it's also important is that, as you are recognizing that one of your jobs is to give this feedback, is that you have to build a relationship with people so they can hear you through the lens of, \"Oh, Alisa wants to help me.\" Not, \"Oh, Alisa hates me. It's always a problem.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:21):\nHow did you start that phrase again? Because the starting is always the hardest part for me. How do you kick off the conversation? What was the couple sentences used?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:15:28):\nI wanted to have a conversation with you about some things I've been hearing from your peers about the way that you all are interacting together.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):\nAwesome. So there's an element of, don't make it feel like a huge deal. Just like, \"I want to have this conversation with you about something.\" And it's just like, \"Let's have this conversation and here's what we want to leave this conversation with.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:15:46):\nYes. And I can't stress enough that it's actually really helpful to also have spent some time with Matilda or whoever saying, \"Great job on the way that project landed.\" Or, \"Hey, launches, when they happen on time and they're smooth, sometimes we don't notice anything. I want you to notice, we didn't notice anything. That's fantastic. You did a good job in that launch,\" or whatever it is. Because then, you've had the conversation with them to give them positive feedback and point out what's working, that builds the relationship so that you have the lens of, \"Oh, yeah. When something's working, they tell me. When something's not working, they tell me, too.\" That's how you build trust as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:23):\nThey want to be criticizing them [inaudible 00:16:25]. We need to have another conversation what we're hearing about, problems [inaudible 00:16:28].\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:16:27):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:29):\nObviously, if you say it the same way every single time, they're going to feel like this is weird. Do you recommend it's this",

Do you recommend it's this kind of Mad Libs approach or is it make it your own as much as you can? What are kind of the key? Or is it like, here's actually how you want to say it every time?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:16:42):\nIn my book and when I work with my clients, I give specific scripts and what I will regularly say when I'm working with my clients is, \"Okay, so this is how I would do it,\" and then I'll land it for them. But they have to make it their own. You always have to make it your own and I don't think it's a problem of doing it the same way every time. It's not like people are going to notice you because you're talking about different topics, theoretically. If you have a formula that can work for you, that's going to motivate you to do it, that is what's important. And what's important is that it's neutral, not loading on or not venting on someone and not unloading on someone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:19):\nI love that we started with this one because it feels like the most common one of just your employee is underperforming and you want to make sure they understand and adjust. What if you're not hearing something from a bunch of people? What if it's just your perception of their writing? You need to work on your writing skills or you're coming in late. Is there another way you phrase it where it's not, \"I'm hearing it from other people?\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:17:43):\nOh, absolutely. Absolutely. So I'll talk about writing. I think it would be something like, okay, \"Matilda, part of your job is to be able to create these documents and I appreciate that you do them on time. What I've observed is that they can often be not as structured as I'd like them to be and they also lack a conclusion. So what I'd love you to do is look at these three or four examples of some folks who are doing them really well and see if you can model your writing on theirs. If you need to take additional classes or if you need help in any way, let me know. But ultimately, I want to get your writing to the level where everybody is appreciating what you bring to the table because the level of your writing really reflects the level of your thinking.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:27):\nMm-hmm. Wow, I like that. I'd want to follow your advice if I got that. So the way you started that is what I've observed, which also is not like, \"Here's what I think\" or \"Here's what you just need to do.\" It's more like, \"Here's what I've noticed, here's what I've seen, here's what I've observed about what you're doing.\" And then it reminds me of, what is it, nonviolent communication, that whole framework of just focus on what you see, not what is wrong with them, not what they've done. I guess, is there anything there you want to say of just the importance of focusing on what you've heard from people or what you've observed versus maybe what people often do instead?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:19:05):\nYeah, I mean you just really said it and I think it's such an important point, observable facts. The idea that this is not a judgment. This is not... Sort of as less judgy as possible is also very helpful. It makes it neutral. It's observable facts and it's also sort of based on expectations, right? So the writing is, we expect it to be at a certain level and it's not that way. And here are the reasons it's not, the specific reasons, it's not.\n\n(00:19:35):\nThe way you interact with your peers, it's important to be at a certain standard, and here's why. Because when we all work together, we're going to be able to execute and when we don't, unfortunately we won't be able to. So you staying in sync with them is important and the observation is that they don't feel fully in sync with you.\n\n(00:19:52):\nAnd so every time we talk about this, it doesn't become this, \"Oh, I don't know. I just feel...\" By the way, some things you have to give feedback on and they are kind of a feeling and those are more difficult, but so many things if you do the work to really think about what is the observable data, I always ask my clients, what's my evidence that this is happening? And you have to spend some time thinking about it, but it's really worth it because it makes the feedback easier for you to give and easier for them to hear.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:20):\nIs there anything else along the lines of this specific type of feedback that is worth sharing before we move on to a different type of feedback?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:20:29):\nWell, I think just that the reason, one of the many reasons that people have gone uncomfortable giving feedback is that somebody might get defensive or they might start crying as we talked about. And so I have a script also, which is if someone gets defensive, which is it's like I'm giving you this feedback and you're getting defensive and I say, \"Well, let's pause for a second. First of all, I want you to know that I'm telling you this actually",

And so I have a script also, which is if someone gets defensive, which is it's like I'm giving you this feedback and you're getting defensive and I say, \"Well, let's pause for a second. First of all, I want you to know that I'm telling you this actually, just to make you better because I know how important your career is to you. I know how important the success is to you and it's important to me too as your leader. The second thing is, my observation is that you're getting a little bit emotional. I want to know if we can continue having this conversation now or if we need to kind of pause it. At the end of the day, we really have to have this conversation and I really want to see you make changes, but I understand you might need a few moments to digest it.\"\n\n(00:21:18):\nThe importance of that for you is not even what you say, but that you have prepared and you are prepared for if someone has that kind of reaction and that you don't have to, yourself, react to it. You know, \"No, I'm not doing that. No, no, no, no, whatever.\" And you can say, \"Yes, you are.\" Now we're in a fight and that is not cool for anybody. It's certainly not cool for you as a leader. So it gives you the opportunity to recognize that you have another tool in your toolkit rather than just react.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:48):\nSo if you find yourself feeling defensive or they are just not hearing and just fighting back, the tool is just pause. Let's just pause for a moment and it feels like there's kind of two parts to which you just shared. One is, remind them why this is important to them and why you're talking about this. And then two is, if there's just emotions kind of taking over, give them a chance to like, \"Let's just pause and maybe come back to this because maybe you're not in the right state right now to listen.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:22:18):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:20):\nSometimes people get upset when you mention like, \"You're getting emotional,\" or I don't know. Is that a thing that you deal with of just like, \"How dare you say I'm feeling emotional?\" I'm just...\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:22:29):\nI'm not emotional. Why do you think [inaudible 00:22:31] emotional? Right, exactly. Yes, of course. Now, when someone's crying, they're obviously getting emotional. When they're defensive, it's possible that you might want to use a different word. I can see that this is really upsetting you or this is really triggering you, or I can see that the temperature between us has just changed. You could say something like that. I do think also it's helpful to know your people because sometimes you could realize that actually they can deal with that, but then sometimes you have to really [inaudible 00:23:00] the delicate words that you need to use to pause the conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:05):\nYeah. And I find, to your point, it's helpful to you too as the person giving it. And I feel like sometimes, you may be feeling like I should just pull back and maybe I'm wrong, maybe they're right, maybe I should stop and instead this gives you a chance to know I'm actually, I can't. I need to stay strong about what I believe because I... You put so much thought and effort into this already, it's unlikely you're just like, oh, totally wrong about what you're saying.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:23:30):\nYeah, exactly. There's something going on. There's something going on. And then also, the whole point about it being a conversation is that actually it's a conversation. Actually, Lenny, if you have a different point of view, I would like to hear it. Let's talk about it, but we can't keep going on like this, where I don't feel I can count on you for whatever it is that we're talking about. So we need to have this conversation and recreate a set of expectations between ourselves. Ultimately, that kind of conversation has the potential to really build the relationship and build trust, and that's another reason I encourage everybody to get over their discomfort and to lean into having these conversations because on the other side of that, is a much better, stronger connection.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):\nAnd especially if you do them well.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:24:11):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:12):\nFollowing this advice. So okay, so again, if somebody's feeling defensive, can you again say how you start that, if you notice that? And then I'll highlight the two elements again of the...\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:24:25):\nSo the way to pause is to actually say, \"Let's just pause for a second because I'm feeling the energy has changed and I can see that you're getting a little bit heated by what I'm saying and I want you to know that I have no intention of upsetting you. I just want to be able to talk to you about the things that are going to help you in your career.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:45):\nAwesome. And I love, again, just the reminder of here's why this is important to you, here's the benefit to you and why this will help you. And then it's like, \"Okay, let's just maybe",

And I love, again, just the reminder of here's why this is important to you, here's the benefit to you and why this will help you. And then it's like, \"Okay, let's just maybe take a pause and come back to this conversation if you're feeling like this isn't the best time.\" Awesome. Anything else along that line before we go to another type of a hard conversation?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:25:02):\nI mean, I can talk all day about this [inaudible 00:25:06], but I'm happy to move on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:07):\nWell, let's pick another topic. I know you have kind of five buckets and types of conversation. Maybe the promotion one. That feels like I think we're in performance review season. It feels like these are happening a bunch. What do you suggest when someone's being told they're not going to get the promotion they expected or wanted?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:25:24):\nOf course that's challenging. So again, getting your mindset right, recognizing they're disappointed, they're going to be disappointed, recognizing how you felt, the time that when you didn't get a promotion or whatever. And so kind of coming to it with some compassion. And also, you have to get your reasoning right. So sometimes people think they should get a promotion because they were here for a year or whatever. Sometimes people think they should get a promotion because they're the only internal candidate who's qualified for this or they might have a sense of themselves succeeding or achieving that is more inflated maybe than you see them. So trying to think about where they're coming from.\n\n(00:25:56):\nAnd then the conversation is just, \"Matilda, I know this is going to be challenging for you to hear. I know you were hoping to get that promotion, but I want to let you know that we are going to actually be looking for an external candidate. I want to give you a few thoughts about why. First of all, in discussing this with my peers, I'm realizing that we need someone who has done this role multiple times in the past and has that experience. Number two, I think it's really important that they have an expertise in a specific realm that we've identified as really important. So for those reasons, we're going to bring someone in from the outside, not going to promote you, but I want you to know this. Number one, it's really important to me that you're able to succeed in your career here. And so I want to continue to help you find opportunities to build your skills and to advance. And then number two, when we bring this person in, I'm committed to finding someone who's a great people leader, who is going to help you build those skills.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:54):\nSo a few elements there that stood out to me. One is just being very upfront and not bearing the lead. Telling them very early, \"Here's what I've decided.\" As you said it, I could see my heart sinking immediately when I feel that. So at least that's over and then it's, here's why. And that starts to help you feel like, \"Okay, I get it. I understand at least how you thought about this.\" And then there's the hope for the future, your painting of, here's how I can get there eventually.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:27:21):\nYes, that hope for the future is so important and I think sometimes we're such in a rush to kind of deliver the bad news that we forget there's a human being over there who needs hope for the future. And hopefully. If they're a good employee, hopefully they have hope for the future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):\nI love that. Is there anything else to that script that you think is really highlighting or do you think I touched on the key elements?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:27:41):\nI think you touched on the key elements.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:43):\nOkay. And again, the way you started is, I have some bad news for you or I have some disappointing news for you.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:27:48):\nYes, because it's just [inaudible 00:27:50].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:48):\nJust get right into it. Yeah.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:27:51):\nYeah, just get right into it. Yeah. By the way, the other piece on that might be, if it's appropriate, I'd love you to digest this information and then let's talk about it again next week to see what you've come up with or see how you feel about it because you want to send, this is not the script, this is for me to you. You want to send the, I care about you message because that's the other thing. In the workplace, people, they're going through all their feelings, all their emotions, disappointments. They're going to go home and tell their spouse, didn't get the promotion or whatever. It's going to loom large. It's going to be demoralizing.\n\n(00:28:24):\nWhen you, as a leader signal a lot, I care about you, I care about your feelings, I care that you're disappointed, I care about your career, you are always going to be able to help people stay resilient in the face of setbacks and ultimately, do extra work, do the right work for you and be engaged in your company because you've spent the time",

I guess, that's the defensiveness stuff.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:29:06):\nYeah, that's the defensiveness stuff. And again, I hope you've done your homework to identify that actually that person doesn't have those skills and if there is a [inaudible 00:29:16] for example, but I do have those skills or sometimes people, I think more, even more often, they don't respond to what you just said. They will instead explain to you that they've been here for a year or they're the only internal candidate or their peer got promoted.\n\n(00:29:31):\nRight, they'll sort of explain to you things which are not part of your decision-making process and then it's helpful for you to say something like, \"Yeah, listen, Matilda, I really understand that you were thinking that after a year, you'd get promoted around here. And in the past, I do think because of the stage of our company, probably people have been promoted at that period. That's not the place we're at right now. As we scale, we really need to think about not just what we need for today and tomorrow, but for the future. And that's why I want these specialized skills in here. I think it's going to help the entire company.\"\n\n(00:30:02):\nSo that's an example of a discussion that you could have. I do have the skills. That's kind of interesting. I'd love to hear what you see as those skills. And it's not a problem to have the conversation right there then, but if there's a \"Yes, I do, no, I don't, yes, I do, no, you don't,\" that pushback is never productive. And so, that's where you want to probably again take a pause and say, \"Listen, I totally hear you. You and I have a different point of view about this. I'm not sure if it's productive to continue to discussing right now. Let's talk about it again in a week. But I also want you to know this is a decision that I've made.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:39):\nI love though, when they come back to you and like, \"But here's X, Y, Z.\" And you're like, \"That's not what I was saying necessarily.\" I love that you basically mirror back. I hear what, I understand you believe, I understand you've been here for a year. I understand you're the only internal candidate,\" like making them feel very heard. That's a really powerful mechanic there. That is a good tool. Is there another script that you think might be helpful to talk through that is a common hard conversation people have?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:31:05):\nWell, the hardest conversation is firing someone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:09):\nLet's do it. Let's get into it.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:31:13):\n[inaudible 00:31:13]. I'm willing to get into it. I just want to say two things about that. First of all, when you're firing someone, the hope is that it's not a surprise to them. You've had multiple conversations with them that they're not living up to your expectations. It's essential because the truth is, you want to create a culture where people are not surprised by being fired. And that's not even true for this one person you're dealing with. That's true for the entire company. So just kind of getting in the mindset of recognizing that if you shied away from those conversations, kind of like, \"You're the problem here and you have some catch up to do.\"\n\n(00:31:43):\nThe second thing is that before you fire someone, I think it's helpful to have the conversation before the firing conversation because something you said Lenny is like, \"Oh, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm not sure.\" And that bleeds into, \"Maybe I haven't been clear with this person.\" Regularly with my clients, I'll say, \"Okay, have you been crystal clear about what you need from this person?\" And what they always do is the hand motion like well, sort of, but well, maybe. Which means no, which means no. You've not been crystal clear or you don't perceive even crystal clear. The way to make sure that you're crystal clear is by having the conversation before it comes to that.\n\n(00:32:23):\nWhat that looks like is, \"Listen, Matilda, we have to have a difficult conversation right now. I've talked to you multiple times about coordinating with your peers and not having them surprised about missed deadlines, and I've talked to you multiple times about keeping your team in the loop on different things. After six months of these conversations, I want you to know that the peers continue to feel like that you're operating on your own without coordinating with them. And I continue to hear from your team that they're not fully on the same page. I need you to know that this is very important. I need you to fix this within the next",

I value all you bring to the table, but if you don't fix these things, we're not going to have a future together.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:19):\nThat is very crystal clear.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:33:20):\nYes, crystal clear.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:22):\nYeah. Okay.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:33:22):\nWhat do you think of that?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:24):\nYeah, that was great. So it starts with being upfront. This is a difficult conversation, just to set expectations. They're like, \"Oh, shit.\" And then it seems like you come back to, again, multiple times this happened, observing here's what's happening. It's happened multiple times. I keep hearing from multiple people, [inaudible 00:33:44] be a problem. And so it's just like, \"I need you to know,\" and you're just very clear. \"Here's what will happen if this doesn't change.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:33:52):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:52):\nYeah. And I love that you also give them a little, there's always that hope for who they are and how you see them as. They're not worthless. It's just like, \"You are great at a lot of things. You have these skills. You're great at blah, blah, blah, but still this is a big problem.\" And it's communicating how critical this is. [inaudible 00:34:08].\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:34:08):\nYeah, and it's a deal breaker. It's a deal breaker. Right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:10):\nYeah.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:34:12):\nIf you have so many talents, but if you can't do these two things, then it's a deal breaker for all of us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:16):\nYeah.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:34:16):\nAnd I think it's important to really sort of see that both. Sometimes people think, \"Well, but I'm so talented.\" Yeah, but your talents are not going to make up for these two deal breakers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:25):\nYeah. And I feel like I know we were going to talk about the firing conversation, but I think this is even more important than that because hopefully, this addresses the problem and you don't need to fire them, which is more valuable.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:34:36):\nYes. Yeah, hopefully. But even if you do, it's actually easier because you've already had the conversation. Right? They're not surprised. It's clear. We've had the discussion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:46):\nYeah. So basically the script is like, \"There's going to be a difficult conversation. I've seen multiple times this thing and we've talked multiple times and it's still not fixed and here's what I just want to be very clear about.\" Is there also a script you have for just actually doing the firing or is that less scriptable?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:35:05):\nWell, the script for doing the firing is again, please everybody, talk to your HR professional. Talk to your lawyer. Okay, I'm not a lawyer, I'm afraid. So you have to make sure that you're all buttoned up on what you're going to do. But the conversation is actually very simple, which is just, \"Matilda, we talked about this multiple times. The last time we had this conversation, I told you I needed you to make these changes. You haven't made these changes and we're going to part ways. So I have here, Sarah from HR or whatever, and we're going to talk through the logistics of that. I'm happy to have a longer conversation with you, but I want you to know we've made the decision to terminate you.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:42):\nFeels very reasonable to me. Is there anything else along these lines?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:35:46):\nI think what I want to say is that the conversations you need to have at work are not just difficult conversations. What I call them is sort of delicate conversations because what I think people also shy away from is just simple praise, specific praise. And I think it's really important to get in the habit of pointing out what your people are doing well as carefully as you need to prepare for pointing out what they need to improve. And sometimes leaders feel like, \"Yeah, it's all working. It's all working. I don't have to tell you.\" Or if I do tell you, it's kind of like \"Good job.\" Right? One time a leader or a manager I was doing in a training program, she said, \"I don't like getting positive feedback. I only like getting negative feedback.\" And I said, \"How come?\" And she said, \"Oh, positive feedback is just like, oh, good job. Negative feedback, you can learn",

You get something from it.\"\n\n(00:36:40):\nSo the positive feedback should have the same standard, which is, \"I saw the way you ran that launch, it was fantastic. All these different benefits came from it. You're so organized, keep doing that.\" Or \"The way you're keeping your peers in the loop, considering you've only been here three months is extraordinary. I've never seen someone so communicative. It's fantastic. Keep doing that. That's really working for you.\" If you do that often enough, you do get in the... First of all, it's positive, obviously. You become in the habit of getting better at positive feedback, which is extremely motivating to people at work. It helps them see their progress because that person I just mentioned, she's barely keeping her head above water and she's having trouble fitting in or whatever, but you come around and point out the things that are working. Again, it's very morale boosting. She knows where she stands, and then one day, if you have to give her these difficult messages, you've already sort of laid the reservoir of goodwill.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:37):\nI love giving positive feedback. It's obviously so much easier, but to your point, it's like you have to really think about how to do it well. It's not just a, it's not that easy if you do it well, which is a really good point. And [inaudible 00:37:49] needs scripts for how to give really good positive feedback and have great conversations.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:37:53):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:53):\nThat's interesting. There's less demand for that. How do I have better great conversations or compliments?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:37:59):\nRight, right. True.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:59):\nNo man.

I want to go on a little bit of a tangent, something that it's kind of touches on all the things we've been talking about, which is, you're big on helping leaders understand that their job is not to make employees happy. What is your job instead? Why do people think this is their job to make their employees happy and what should they be thinking instead is their job as a leader?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:39:09):\n[inaudible 00:39:09], I work with a lot of founders and so, don't forget that the entry-level position for a founder is leader, and they have it, they often not had a lot of other experiences being a leader or a manager, and so they're just doing the best they can. It makes sense, right? And they kind of get all this information from other people and their HR leader wants to have a happy engaged workforce and they don't want to upset people for all the reasons we talked about, why you don't want to upset people. Nobody wants to upset people.\n\n(00:39:40):\nAnd so there's this idea of, they're trying to now be now be the leader who everyone loves and makes people happy. So they would often bend over backwards to make people happy, to keep people, their morale up. But what really needs to happen very often is, we need to drive towards results. And the way this system is working is not going to drive us towards results or this employee continuing to not really do a great job at their job and not really pushing themselves. And you don't want to push them because you don't want to upset them, you don't want to give them difficult feedback, so you're just going to keep hoping it works out.\n\n(00:40:23):\nUltimately, that leads to the demise of your company. I mean, ultimately right, as you're a startup? If you're not in a startup and you're a large company, it still is very subpar performance, obviously. And you're dancing around hoping and praying they're going to get there and they don't really know there's a problem. And so, I think it's very misguided for leaders to have this notion that their most important role is to keep people happy, is to create this high engagement workforce. High engagement workforce is great.\n\n(00:40:56):\nI think what that comes from is winning culture, which means we're set up for success. We've got the structure for success, we have the culture for success, everyone understands their role, they know the impact of their role. So doing the work to figure out and help them figure out the impact of their role and that when they work together and achieve these milestones, they win and then we celebrate the wins and then we do it all over again",

So doing the work to figure out and help them figure out the impact of their role and that when they work together and achieve these milestones, they win and then we celebrate the wins and then we do it all over again. And when you create that kind of a workforce, I think it's much more dynamic, even though sometimes in doing that, you have to redirect people and ruffle their feathers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:26):\nEssentially, the way I think about it is you think making people happy is not having hard conversations, not pushing them, when really, it's almost working backwards from, if we win and are killing it, people will be happy and what does it take to do that?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:41:40):\nA hundred percent. And then the right people are going to want to join your team, people who like to win and like to get results.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:48):\nIs there a story, an example of a founder you worked with or that comes to mind of this kind of where they thought this was their approach and then they shifted? Or is there kind of a pattern you see often?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:41:57):\nOne company comes to mind. One leader I worked with. Sometimes I think to myself, if I'm writing a book, the book would start with, \"It all started with the avocado toast,\" because he wants to do right by his workforce. And so they have avocado toast at 10 AM, like tea time kind of a thing. And it became this great ritual where people would kind of hang out together and that was great. And then that turned into other longer periods of just hanging out together. Again, these are good things. And that turned into evening socials and everybody was enjoying spending time together, but they continued to be not fully clear on what they were actually supposed to do. And there began to be kind of a cliquey, gossipy culture of who's in and who's out. And that would take up a lot of the socialization time discussions. So rather than talk about expectations about the work and about results, and again, the results were not showing. So it wasn't a lot to celebrate.\n\n(00:43:05):\nThey started at a culture committee. So they had a culture committee to talk about how we can make people happier around here. And you can imagine there's now layers and layers of things where we're trying to focus on engagement and we're trying to focus on the employees having a great experience. And the leader I'm working with is completely sincere. It actually want to have a great workplace. But I think the misguidedness was that he hadn't done a great job setting expectations. He had not done a great job of quote unquote \"codifying their culture\" because culture is not just avocado toast and working together and having socials, culture is things like, we go the extra mile or culture is we make sure, or it could be, we measure twice and cut once. Those are kinds of things that are really about the way we get work done around here. And certainly, a focus on results is like, are we following the process to then get the revenue and to then build a profitable company or are we just kind of hanging out together?\n\n(00:44:07):\nSo he had to come to terms with his own discomfort of addressing this with employees and his own discomfort in being a corporate drone of, \"Oh, expectations and in the workplace and how we do things.\" And it turned out that's the whole thing with coaching and with working with people is that you kind of see what their underlying assumptions and beliefs are and there's a reason everyone does what they do. So there's a reason he's doing what he's doing. We had to come to terms with that and then he had to really courageously make some changes about the way he was operating. And ultimately, they had to part ways with one or two really toxic people who were creating this gossipy culture and making people feel not included and not focused on results. And then when they all got on the same page, they were able to gain a lot more traction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:56):\nI feel like a lot of leaders and founders can relate to this, of wanting to create a great culture and keep it nice and friendly and everyone's a family and then things don't quite work out often in those cases. And there's a shift to, \"Okay, we actually need to make a business that works.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:44:56):\nRight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:12):\nIt always reminds me, Sheryl Sandberg came to talk at Airbnb once and people are asking, \"What do you do with all this...? We're just constantly in chaos. Things are always reorging or changing, just never... I'm on different teams every six months. Our goals are shifting. What do you do with all this... Our culture's changing as we grow.\" And she's like, \"That is a sign of hyper growth and success. And the opposite is even worse when you are not growing and you don't want that. And so you should be happy this is the challenge you're running into.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:45:40):\nI love that. It's so true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:42):\nSo along these lines, you talk about how a lot of founders have to come to terms, and it's not just founders, it's just execs and leaders you work with",

It's so true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:42):\nSo along these lines, you talk about how a lot of founders have to come to terms, and it's not just founders, it's just execs and leaders you work with, have to come to terms with, \"Here's what I thought leadership was going to be and how to be a great leader, and here's what it really is.\" Is there anything more there that you find is commonly what they're wrong about or what they miss and what they have to realize?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:46:01):\nYeah. And I think as we grow as leaders, we all have to realize our own blind spots and the difference between what we thought and what is actually going on. So I worked with a founder who she wanted to be was a visionary leader, which is fantastic. I would love that. And she was an incredibly visionary person, very inspirational. But what she didn't see is that what her company needed was somebody to structure and hold people accountable and help them create goals and achieve milestones and course correct when they got off course. And she'd be very frustrated when all those things happened. People got off course, people didn't have goals, people weren't structured to work together. But what she didn't realize was that was, in one way or the other, her job to make that happen.\n\n(00:46:49):\nNow, maybe she needed to have, and I would talk to her a lot about this, a partner, like a COO or somebody else who could be the person who would be sort of managing the internal while she got to be more visionary, inspirational, but ultimately, it was her job to make sure that that was in place. And she didn't sort of see that and she did not adjust her style. And so there's a lot of wheel spinning that happens from that. Even though, by the way, she was an incredibly inspirational person and incredibly inspirational leader and she meant so well. There was nothing malicious about it. It's just that she didn't see the situation for what it was and then adjust.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:30):\nIt reminds me, we had this coach on the podcast, Joe Hudson, and he had this phrase that I think a lot of people use, but it just stuck with me. What you resist, persists. So if you hate confrontation, you're going to have much more confrontation. If you hate structure... Actually, this reminds me, Joe Gebbia at Airbnb. He was very anti-process at the beginning of Airbnb. He's like, \"We're not going to have a process. I hate process. We're going to run... That's the big company stuff.\" And then it just chaos constantly. And then eventually it's like, \"Okay, we need to have some process to how we build things.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:48:02):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:03):\nAnd so it's interesting. A lot of people have to realize the thing they think was bad is actually, I see why people do it this way.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:48:10):\nYeah, totally. Actually, I'd like to say something about that because so many... Founders are kind of mavericks and they come into a situation or they start at this company and they want to do things their own way and that's fantastic. Otherwise, they wouldn't be a founder. That's actually fantastic. And so many of the founders I've worked with want to reinvent leadership. Right? They want to have it with no process, they want to have no hierarchy, they want to have autonomy, whatever it is.\n\n(00:48:37):\nAnd my feeling is like, \"God bless. You should absolutely try to do that.\" But at the end of the day, what happens is, they kind of invent for themselves the understanding that they need to have process, hierarchy, roles and responsibilities, goals, OKRs, whatever it is. And I think it's helpful sometimes to go through that fire of thinking we can do it a different way. But ultimately, I think that the ways to structure a group of people and get them organized so that they can win, are kind of well trod. And I would say that it's helpful to get through that stage quickly so that you don't have to constantly reinvent the wheels of leadership.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:19):\nSuch an important context. Obviously, one of the... The most successful founders come up with, have first principles thinking into how to do stuff, and oftentimes they find something no one has ever thought about. So it's always this balance of try a bunch of stuff, a lot of it won't [inaudible 00:49:34]. Some of it was, what will help you win. And I think that's a really good point. I want to get into a couple more tactical things that you often work on with founders. One is, running meetings. Meetings come up a lot on this podcast. People hate them, people love them. There's some are great, some are bad, most are bad. You have some cool advice on just how to make meetings more effective and how to especially end a meeting to help you move forward. Talk about what your advice is there and just generally any advice for better meetings.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:50:01):\nYeah. I'm one of the few people that loves meetings. Or I should say I don't love meetings. I love the potential for meetings. We have all this smart people in the room. We have the potential to talk about these great things",

Or I should say I don't love meetings. I love the potential for meetings. We have all this smart people in the room. We have the potential to talk about these great things and make decisions. And unfortunately, they don't go that way. So what happens often, I mean there's so many downfalls with meetings, but one thing that happens is, we keep meeting. Either we make decisions or we don't make decisions, but then we come back to meet again and we don't have any continuity from the last. So then we re-meet, we re-decide, and that is a big problem. So my three questions to end the meeting are, what did we decide here? Who needs to do what by when? And who else needs to know? And if you can capture those, articulate those as deliverables, I promise you, you're going to have better meetings.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:51):\nOkay, so it's, what did we decide here? Who's going to do what by when? So basically, action items with dates. And then, who needs to know about what we decided here? Is that how you put it?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:51:01):\nYes. Who else needs to know? There's so many executive teams that I've worked with and at first, they go into their room, they have their meeting, they make their decisions and then they leave and they don't tell anyone. \"I made this promise for my team that you guys need to kind of go do.\" Or, \"We decided on a policy of some sort and we forgot to tell everybody.\" And again, no, absolutely no maliciousness, just that they forget or they're too busy and there's not part of the protocol and the process inside of the company that encourages and really insists that people share important information, so cascading that down.\n\n(00:51:37):\nBut even the first question, what did we decide here? If you really go around the room at the end of a meeting or six people in the meeting, let's say, and you say to everybody, \"What did we decide here?\" And they all write it down, you will get six different answers, even though we're in the same meeting. I love that it's so powerful, but also, so helpful to really raise that up, to surface that and then to figure out what to do about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:58):\nI love that you highlighted that. I was going to say exactly the same thing, that everyone in their head has the thought of, \"Here, oh yeah. Here's what we decided.\" And to your point, it's often not the same. So is the advice here, is this like a template or something you fill out at the end of a meeting or is it someone's job to make sure these three things happen or how do you operationalize these three questions?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:52:19):\nI like it that it's someone's job, the person that I sort of think of as the meetings are. And typically, that's somebody who enjoys follow-up, who enjoys putting lists together and putting things into boxes and whatnot, and there's usually someone like that on the team. And so then it's kind of exciting for them to be the follower upper. But one way or the other, so you could use a template. I think that actually baking it in as a ritual to the meeting, because the other thing about meetings is that we never have enough time. We go right to the end and we don't leave the five or 10 minutes at the end to make sure that we ask these three questions and make sure that we have an understanding of what the follow through is on these meetings.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:57):\nWhat I'm imagining is, say it's the product managers. Put this doc on the screen in the meeting as the meeting's ending and just have it filled out basically, and just confirm, \"Does this look good to everyone?\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:53:09):\nLove that. That's a great way to do it. By the way, with... Well, I just would say what's interesting about that is that if we ask people what did we decide here, I think there's value in just asking that question in particular because somebody might say, \"We decided,\" I don't know, \"Something.\" And other people would say, \"No, we didn't. But that's actually a good idea. It sort of crystallizes what we did talk about in a more comprehensive way.\" I think there's value in raising the differences and I think there's value in stitching those together. So just putting it up on the board is good, especially if you're running short of time. I worry that somebody might not weigh in and say, \"Actually, I have a very different point of view of what we decided here.\" So maybe it's also about building the culture to break in and say, \"No, that's not what I see. Let's spend some time on that.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:03):\nLet's actually spend more time on this because this is really, I think, really this specific detail I think could be really powerful if you do it right. So say you're the PM in the meeting, who do you ask? Do you say to the room, \"What did we decide here?\" Or do you look at the most senior person? Otherwise, it feels like it could just lead to a whole discussion the last couple of minutes, which I guess could be valuable,",

Otherwise, it feels like it could just lead to a whole discussion the last couple of minutes, which I guess could be valuable, but who do you point this question to?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:54:24):\nYeah. So I picture this for let's say, a six-person executive team meeting, which means everyone go around quickly and say, \"What did we decide here?\" Now, if you're in a meeting with a large executive team, which I do work with sometimes or non-executive team, like a group of some sort, then you probably want to get a few people just to... I would just even say as a facilitator, two or three people, \"Okay, two or three people, what do we decide here?\" And if you can kind of get common, great. That's fantastic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:52):\nGot it. Okay. So if it's a small meeting, go around the room and everyone just shares, here's what we decided here. And they could just be like, \"Yep, he's got it or she's got it.\" Awesome. Okay. This is great. So the advice here is, next time you have a meeting, especially an exec meeting, just at the end of the meeting, you, the listener of this podcast, just ask, \"Okay, everyone. Let's just make sure we're on the same page. What did you decide here? Who needs to do what by when?\" And then everyone chimes in and you're writing this in this doc, and then what else? Who needs to know about what we decided here?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:55:22):\nYeah. Lenny, I love that because also, do you have to be the leader of the meeting to do that? No. You could just be the person in the meeting and just chime in and just start it yourself. And if you do that and everyone kind of picks it up, it can become a ritual just by virtue of your own agency. So I love that you just encouraged everyone to do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:42):\nAnd this is how you become a leader, is you just start doing these things and people are like, \"Oh, Alisa is so helpful. She's just on top of it. Every time she's in a meeting, the meetings go better. We get things done.\" So I think just doing the thing that is useful to everyone is how you move up.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:55:56):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:57):\nAmazing. Okay. Another topic that I know you spend a lot of time on is something you call the founder prenup. And what I love about this is, a lot of the problems that a company trickle down from the founders having their challenges with each other. And I started a company in the past and I don't think people realize how significant this decision is in your life. It's basically, you are marrying someone in a business context and you're stuck with this person for a long time and you basically came up with a prenup, which is a set of questions of just things you need to talk about to make sure you're aligned before you start this company. Is there any context around this thing before we talk through actually the questions that you recommend people talk through?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:56:41):\nWell, I just want to reiterate what you just said. Exactly right. And it turns out that according to Noam, Noam Wasserstein, 65% of startups fail because of conflict with founders or the founding team. So it's really essential to get this right, and I agree that people step into this relationship with a lot less care than they should. And bad things can happen because you haven't done the work of getting to know each other before you decide to co-found.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:12):\nYeah. It's so easy just to like, \"Yeah, I'll start a company. We have this cool idea. Let's just do it. It's going to be so awesome.\" And then you don't realize how much you're committing to and how often things don't work out because of that quick decision. And oftentimes, it's like friends and then it becomes even more challenging because I want to be friends, but we're in business together. So yeah. Let's talk about what you recommend folks talk through as much as we can on this podcast.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:57:36):\nSo I do have kind of an extensive questionnaire, so we just touch on a few things, but one thing I think first and foremost is, what are your values? And I think it's really essential to do some sort of values clarification exercise. You can find a ton of them online. You can find a list of values and just pull out your core values and just compare them with each other because when you are aligned, it's great. Or when you're adjacent, it's also great.\n\n(00:58:01):\nI might care a lot about excellence, Lenny, you might care a lot about learning. Fantastic. Those are great values that we can kind of, go together. I might care about excellence and you might care about work-life balance. Wow, let's talk about that because I think it's going to be really important as we go through our startup journey that we understand both of us, what does work-life balance mean and what does excellence mean? Because those two things can at",

    "content": ":58:01):\nI might care a lot about excellence, Lenny, you might care a lot about learning. Fantastic. Those are great values that we can kind of, go together. I might care about excellence and you might care about work-life balance. Wow, let's talk about that because I think it's going to be really important as we go through our startup journey that we understand both of us, what does work-life balance mean and what does excellence mean? Because those two things can at times be at odds with each other, just as kind of an example.\n\n(00:58:30):\nSo talking through those core values in advance and updating them regularly, even as you go down the path together is so essential. Just so you know where the other person's coming from. Because the other problem is, someone acts in a certain way, you don't know them that well maybe, or maybe you've known them as an eighth grader. A lot of founders do know each other from their youth and they've matured into different kinds of people. And so you think they're acting strangely, but actually, they're acting in accordance with their values. And so getting a handle on that upfront can solve, I would just say, solve a lot of problems before they start.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:08):\nSo signs that your values don't align. It's basically you both can't be true is almost the way I think about it as we talk. It's hard to be the excellent, focus on excellence and also not work long hours, which it's possible, but it's hard. Those are challenging and worth the conversation.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:59:26):\nYeah, worth the conversation because in fact, as you say that, I'm like, \"Well, I guess you can do that. Right. You can do that.\" And so therefore, that's where the conversation has to figure out how you're going to marry these two values, which might be at odds or might be aligned, but let's talk through what work-life balance means to you and let's talk through what excellence means to me, and let's see if we can have a meeting of the minds about it or at least I know where you stand.\n\n(00:59:50):\nOne of the founders I worked with, he would text or Slack his co-founder on weekends and the co-founder wouldn't respond. And that was extremely frustrating to the person, to the co-founder I was talking to. And it turned out, after they finally addressed it, it really was about wanting to have some downtime and some, quote unquote, \"Balance.\" Nothing wrong with that, but because they didn't talk about it, both sides made [inaudible 01:00:20] big assumption about it and then it caused this conflict that didn't have to happen if they'd had the conversation in advance.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:25):\nComes back to where we started of having these conversations is necessary and almost helps the other person because this small issue could become a huge issue over time, if you just start assuming and it keeps happening and it keeps scratching and scratching at you. And letting that person's [inaudible 01:00:45] is screwed up because you're, \"I can't do this with you anymore.\" Right? So it's just another reminder of how it's good for the other person for you to engage in a difficult conversation.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:00:54):\nYes, very true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:55):\nOkay, what else? So values. By the way, is there a values framework you most love that you can point people to or there just a bunch and don't worry too much about which one you go [inaudible 01:01:05]?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:01:04):\nI mean, the one I use is super simple, which is on the thing called the internet. There's a lot of lists of values and I think when you see a list of values, you can pull out the ones that are most meaningful to you, and that's a very simple and helpful and free tool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:19):\nGot it. So you just Google list of values, there's a PDF, and just circle the ones that are most and pick whatever small number, don't... Half of [inaudible 01:01:27]-\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:01:26):\nActually, well, just to give you the process, right? It's helpful to pick 20, for example. Great. And then you winnow them down to, let's say, 10. And then you do the difficult work of winnowing them down to three to five that you feel are core to you. And that's a good exercise for everyone to do actually, every year because things can change. It also forces you to make the difficult decisions about when it comes down to it, what are the things that really are important to me? The more you know your values, the more you can operate in the world with just more clarity for yourself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:58):\nAwesome. All right. So values. What else?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:02:01):\nYeah. So another one is, vision of the company. So when this company is successful, what does that look like? And what that might look like is, we're in control of our destiny and we are able to operate this business independently and we have a lot of freedom. What that might look like is a big venture outcome that we all read about. And if you are both assuming that you both think the same thing but aren't talking about it explicitly or talking about the trade-offs you need to make inherent in that, then what often happens if you have differences is they",

And if you are both assuming that you both think the same thing but aren't talking about it explicitly or talking about the trade-offs you need to make inherent in that, then what often happens if you have differences is they come home to roost while it's too late or when it's too late.\n\n(01:02:40):\nSo an example is the two co-founders I worked with, one of them would said to me wistfully, this is like five or six years into the company, and the company was going well, but it was challenging and they had all their growing pains and like you mentioned about Sheryl said all the chaos. And he said to me, \"Gosh, I don't see why we have to grow. I just wish we could actually have fewer employees. And I used to love it when I knew everybody's name and I would just much prefer an environment where we didn't have to grow.\" Well, unfortunately, they were already venture backed and also, the other co-founder had a very lofty ambition for a very big company. And since they hadn't talked about that, it was way too late to even have that conversation and it was a very painful reckoning for both of them to realize they were not on the same page.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:33):\nTotally, see the value of this one. I could totally see how people would have different goals. I imagine it also changes over time, so there's probably an element of, if something has shifted for you, you should probably also have that conversation. I don't want to build an IPO venture scale business, I just want to build something chill. So basically, a line on what is... How would you phrase that? What does winning look like to you?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:03:52):\nYeah, what does success look like?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:54):\nWhat does success look like to you?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:03:54):\nOr what's the vision for the company when it reaches its full potential?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:01):\nOkay. Great. What else?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:04:01):\nAnother one is, it's sort of a two part question. How do you handle conflict? So how do you handle conflict? But then, you might want to ask your spouse, someone close to you, \"How do I handle conflict?\" Because you might think, \"Oh, I handle conflict with such an enlightened person. I'm so neutral about it. I'm so great at bringing things up.\" But the person who's close to you might say, \"You seethe until you're ready to bring something up and it's really uncomfortable in the seething period.\" So it just gives you a little more self-awareness about how you actually handle conflict.\n\n(01:04:42):\nAnd that's really important because I might be the kind of person who wants to bring up conflict and talk about it immediately. The other person might be a person who totally wants to talk about the conflict but wants to let it settle first and wants to also go through their own thinking process about what's important to them and might actually feel like they've resolved it themselves without having to have a conversation with you. And if you're the person who's like, \"Let's talk about it, let's talk about it, let's talk about it.\" And they're like, \"I'm working through it myself.\" Now you have conflict over the conflict and it just turns into dynamic that's not necessary.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:22):\nAs you go through these questions, it's absurd to imagine people don't do this when they find a co-founder and work through stuff, and I know nobody does. The percentage of people that do this sort of work ahead of time, it's very low. And so I love that we're helping this percentage go up, but it also reminds me of just how crazy it is people don't have these conversations and how it explains why so many founder relationships don't work out. So these are awesome. What else? I know you have a whole list and we'll link to it, right? There's a PDF we can link to?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:05:22):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:53):\nWith the questions or-\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:05:54):\nFor sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:55):\n[inaudible 01:05:55] post. Awesome. Let's do a few more.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:05:57):\nAnother one is, how do we decide when we disagree? And that is a very good thing to explore because there's actually a lot of different ways to decide when you disagree and they're all good. And if you have it sort of upfront and it's just for an ongoing discussion, but if you have it up front like when we disagree, because that's definitely going to happen, let's assume that the person who cares the most can win that argument. That would be a great way to do it. It might be, the person who's got the best perspective and the most expertise can win that argument. It might be, we'll go back and forth when we really disagree. First you win and then I win, like that, back and forth.\n\n(01:06:41):\nThere's so many different ways to handle it and if you talk about it upfront, you'll be much more likely to be able to actually put that into practice when you do disagree because you will definitely disagree. There's no way around that",

There's no way around that. And that's not even a bad thing. You're smart people. You have this dynamic tension in the relationship. You bring different things to the table. You've got different perspectives. Disagreeing is normal. Working through it and having a practice and a process of working through it, will help it be a good conversation rather than this sort of sulky difficult conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:12):\nI love it. Maybe one more?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:07:14):\nYeah. So another one is, what kind of company culture do I think is important? People definitely don't talk about this before they found the company and they assume they're on the same page. So one founder might be, \"I want to have this great company where everyone loves it and we're all loving together and working hard together. And it feels like a...\" To use your word before, \"It feels like a family.\" By the way, that's great. That's fantastic. \"I want to have a get it done, results-focused culture where we're just executing the hell out of everything and that we're just focused on winning.\"\n\n(01:07:52):\nBy the way, those two can actually exist together. But if you're pushing in one direction without the other and your co-founder is pushing the other direction without yours, it really can feel like two different companies. And that's... When I go into a situation at one of my client sites, often I will hear from the employees, \"It feels like we have two different companies and two different cultures depending on whose team you're on.\" And that, of course, leads to lack of coherent working together and certainly even just lack of different standards and expectations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:24):\nAwesome. Okay. To kind of start to wrap our conversation, I want to take us to a recurring segment of this podcast that I call, Fail Corner. We've talked a lot about failure at this point and just all the ways people fail. I'm curious if, in your career or life, there's a story that might be helpful for folks to hear when things didn't go great and you've failed, and if you learn something from that experience. And the reason this is something I do is I feel like people listening to this podcast, everyone's like, \"Sounds so amazing, everything's always going great. They're killing it.\" When in reality, that's not actually how things go. So these end up being really helpful for people like, \"Oh, wow. Even Alisa had a really hard time sometime.\" Is there a story that you could share?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:09:04):\nAbsolutely. I mean, so many examples. I'm going to give two quick examples. One is, when I first started my coaching practice, I just kind of started and so I just did everything I could to get clients, to build a business, to build a practice, to build my brand, all the things. And I was working so hard and I think I'd had this conversation with somebody that didn't go very well. And I just thought, in my mind's eye, I thought, \"Well, what will become of me?\" That was my voice in my head for quite a long time, \"What will become of me?\" And I was living in Boston at the time. I got onto the floor, my hardwood floors in my Brookline condo, and I just balled in the fetal position. I just balled and balled and balled for an hour. It wasn't 10 minutes, it was an hour.\n\n(01:09:50):\nAnd I was so frightened and just upset. Am I going to be able to make this work? And it was a while and I got into the couch and took a little stress nap. And then I got up from my stress nap and I just started making more calls and doing more things. And that was definitely a rock bottom moment for me. And I think what I learned is, you have to literally pick yourself up from the ground and pull yourself forward. And when you keep taking action, action, action, win or lose, win or lose, you'll get where you need to go. And that turned out to be true. But in those moments, I was not thinking that was going to turn out to be true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:32):\nWow. Amazing story. I imagine many people feel those moments and it's empowering to hear that it can all turn out really well, even when you're lying in the floor crying for an hour. An hour is a long time to cry on the floor.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:10:45):\nIt is a long time to cry. It really... I thought about it because most people just cry for 10 or 15 minutes. I was crying for an hour. I'm positive. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:52):\nGreat story. You said you had another story.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:10:56):\nYeah. I'll tell you a second story, which is more focused on actually my work life. So one thing that I do is I do coaching of course and I do off sites. And this was early, early days of my coaching career and I was doing this off site and it wasn't going well. And I was debriefing with my",

So one thing that I do is I do coaching of course and I do off sites. And this was early, early days of my coaching career and I was doing this off site and it wasn't going well. And I was debriefing with my client during the breaks and at one point she said something like, \"I just think we should end this offsite. I just think we should just decide it's over and it's not working.\" And I felt horrible, obviously, humiliated, certainly, and just like that's a failure. That's like, \"Oh, fail.\" And I know that what I took away from it was that I can improve my skills in every aspect of running an offsite.\n\n(01:11:40):\nSo getting aligned with the client in advance, making sure that I had the right activities getting us to our goal, being very goal-oriented and focused, and making sure that I had kind of understood the rhythm of what it takes to bring people together. So I took some training on that. I worked my mentor on that, and I got so great at offsites after that experience. I'll tell you that was a real low because in the moment, in that moment, I'm not thinking, \"I'm going to get great at offsites.\" In that moment I'm thinking, \"Oh, my God. I'm going to get... What will become of me?\" But I turned it into, in my mind's eye, or I should say, I turned it into the ability to build my skills. And I just want to tell everybody, even at your lowest moments, anything that you're learning from that, can then be turned into fuel to build your skills to get great at the thing that you're not great at.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:31):\nWhat I also love about this is there's this feeling of imposter syndrome, is specifically this fear that I do something wrong and it'll all crumble and everyone will see I suck and I never... I don't know anything and everyone will see it. And I love both these stories are like, it doesn't go well and doesn't crumble. You build from there. And no one's like, \"Oh, Alisa's terrible forever.\" No, it's like move on to the next thing. And then you use that as fuel to become really good at this thing that didn't go great.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:12:57):\nYeah, that's really well said.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:00):\nAmazing. Alisa, we covered a lot of stuff. Is there anything that you were hoping to cover or you think might be useful for folks to hear before we move to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:13:10):\nThe only last thing I want to talk about, just sort of circling back to your role as a leader, I was one time working with the CEO who was handling the fact that this launch was not going well, as in the launch wasn't happening. [inaudible 01:13:25] foot off, foot off, foot off. And his point of view was, you need to have patience with it as it goes. And my point of view is, because I've talked to a lot of the people around, was that there was a massive process problem going on that he was not kind of touching into and really investigating because the product manager wasn't experienced, was kind of hiding it because he knew he didn't have the skills, was fighting with engineering, it just wasn't working.\n\n(01:13:53):\nAnd when the CEO was telling me, and we really had a long discussion about this where I kind of enlightened him about some of the issues that he needed to get involved and fix, he kept thinking, \"I need to have patience.\" So what I want to say to everybody is, sometimes you need to have patience and sometimes you need to look at the process. And I think you, as the leader, need to have the wisdom to know the difference, but also your finger on the pulse to recognize, is this an issue with patience or an issue with process?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:22):\nI guess, is there a sign that you're like, it's probably a process thing and you're just ignoring a glaring problem that everyone else sees?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:14:30):\nI think the sign is when, if you search your mind, you don't really know how this thing is going to come together. There's no plan in your mind. You haven't touched in with people or talked to people about what's going on. You kind of hear this uncomfortable silence about it. Those are symptoms that you just need to dive deeper and just be a little more in touch with what's going on and talk to some folks and look at some data. And by the way, it might not be a massive process problem. It might just be one little thing that needs to get unstuck but you, as the leader, need to recognize that and figure out a way to make that unstuck. And if there's, of course, a big problem that needs to somehow be just surfaced.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:09):\nSo if there's this hope this'll work out versus I see a path to this working out, it's probably a problem. Awesome.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:15:16):\nYeah, well said.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:17):\nIs there anything else that you wanted to share or touch on that you think might be helpful?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:15:21):\nWe",

And it helps prompt you to talk about working style together because you may not be co-founders, of course, but you're working on a team with a bunch of people and they all have their different working style.\n\n(01:15:42):\nSo it's kinds of questions like, what communication style do you like the best? How do you like to work? Do you like large uninterrupted blocks? Do you like meetings here and there? When I'm trying to get a hold of you for something important, what's the best way to do that? What is one of your pet peeves or some of your pet peeves? How can I get a gold star with you? Also, this is my favorite. What's your delegation style?\n\n(01:16:10):\nDo you want me to check in with you regularly, like once a week as I'm working down the path of a project? Or do you want me to just let you know when it's done and just tell you at the end that it's been complete? So lots of different ways people assume other people work because it's like your style, but actually it's just your style. So those kinds of conversations can be great for working together and also be a great team activity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:34):\nSo this kind of what goes into these READMEs people put together, here's how to-\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:16:37):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:37):\n... work with me. I really love the gold star concept because I feel like people want to know how do I be super awesome? How do I be really successful working for you? And I like that visual of the gold star and the pet peeves. I feel like a lot of people will identify that. What are my pet peeves so that people don't do these things because they don't know, right? They don't know until you tell them.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:16:55):\nNobody knows what's your operating style until you tell them. And the more you can showcase, the more everybody will be able to do it right for you and you'll be able to do it right for them. And then you'll be able to have better workplace harmony and save your conflict with things that are really important. Not just because like, \"Oh, you didn't text me when I wanted you to text me.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:13):\nBeing clear. What do you know? Is there anything else that you think might be helpful to share before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:17:20):\nNo, just that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:21):\nWell, with that, Alisa, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:17:24):\nI can't wait. I'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:26):\nHere we go. First question, are there two or three books that you find yourself most recommending to other people?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:17:33):\nSo we already talked about Kim Scott, the wonderful, amazing Kim Scott and her book, Radical Candor, is one I recommend a lot to people. It's fantastic. Working Backwards by gosh, Colin Bryar and Bill something, is about sort of the Amazon way of working backwards from the customer. Super geeky and tactical. I love it. I slurp it up like Harry Potter. It's so good. And I definitely recommend to my clients about Amazon's Management Science. And the third is Walt Disney by Neil Gabler because it really shows how Walt Disney, sort of it's everything about his youth and how he turned into a very bad entrepreneur and ultimately into a fantastic inventive entrepreneur. And it shows all the origins of how he invented these different pieces that now make up the Walt Disney Company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:26):\nThe first two recommendations we've had on the podcast, Kim Scott and Bill Carr, is the other-\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:18:29):\nBill Carr.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:30):\n... co-author. He's been on the podcast and people love that episode. I haven't had Walt Disney on. I got to work on that.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:18:37):\nOr the writer, Neil Gabler\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:38):\nOr the writer. Yeah, yeah. Good tip. Okay, next question. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoy?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:18:44):\nYeah, I enjoyed Inside Out 2. I thought it was fantastic, the idea [inaudible 01:18:49].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:48):\nI could see why you love it. I feel like it's for all coaches in the world.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:18:51):\nTotally. Just the",

Just the idea that like, oh yeah, we're all this complex stew of emotions and it's okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:56):\nMm-hmm. I also love that movie. Next question. Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:19:03):\nYes, the Ninja Creami. So good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:07):\nSay more.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:19:09):\nThe Ninja Creami turns anything into ice cream. So you can actually make ice cream. Good, God bless. But I take my protein shake, which is okay, and turn it into ice cream, which is delicious. And it takes 10 minutes and very little prep, and it's simple to use and it works as expected, which so many things do not. The Ninja Creami, go get it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:28):\nThat's the first for the Ninja Creami. And I love, the holidays are coming around, so this is going to be good for people. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to you find useful in work or in life?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:19:41):\nThis quote by Joseph Campbell animates my life, which is, \"If you can see your path all the way through to the end, you are following someone else's path. Your path only becomes clear moment by moment as each foot hits the ground.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:57):\nWow, that's so good. It's so empowering because it helps you realize if you don't see where it's all going, that's normal and that's good. Wow. Great one, good one. I need to do something with all these mottos. They're so good. I need to create a poster or something.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:20:14):\nThat's a great idea. Or your newsletter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:16):\nHere we go.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:20:16):\nSend them out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:18):\nYeah, that's the easy path. Okay. Last question. So I'm curious, and not to create more competition for you, but I feel like a lot of people think about becoming a coach of some kind, like a product coach, exec coach. If someone is thinking about going down that path, is there one piece of advice you could share to help them pursue this path, even explore if it's right for them?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:20:38):\nIf you think you want to become a coach and you immediately want to build up your coaching skills, listen to people more deeply and ask deeper questions, not just respond to what they just said, but why do you think that? Or where is that coming from? And you will see if you enjoy that process of really going deeper with people. I think that would be helpful for everyone to do. But certainly if you want to become a coach, I think that's essential to be able to get really beneath the surface.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:13):\nI love how your energy just changed into coaching mode when you said that. I love that. That was such an interesting thing to see and that was great advice. That's easier said than done. And it's interesting, you could tell people are so good at that specific skill versus not. And so I love that that's the thing to work on, is ask better questions, think deeper about the person and what they're coming from. Alisa, this was incredible. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out, maybe work with you, what kind of people do you work with in case people are interested in that, and finally, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:21:47):\nOh, thank you. Well, I work with executives at startups and also at large public companies, so feel free to reach out if you want to have a conversation about coaching. And you can find me at alisacohn.com. And actually, I'm going to take some resources and put them at a special link, which is alisacohn.com/lenny. If you want to download the Co-Founder Prenup. I also have a Personal Operating Manual and a few other resources I will put there. So alisacohn.com/lenny and you can also join my newsletter from there.\n\n(01:22:20):\nAnd I think in terms of helping me, I guess there's two things I want to say. My life's work genuinely is to make a difference. When I became a coach, it was because the music in my head was to make a difference. And so I hope I've made a difference for all of you today and I would invite you to try one thing that makes you uncomfortable, this week. As soon as you hear this, this week, try something that makes you uncomfortable and feel free to let me know on LinkedIn or even send me an email and let me know what you did that made you uncomfortable.\n\n(01:22:51):\nSo that would be very meaningful to me. And the second thing that would be very meaningful to me is if you would go find",

    "content": "Lenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nBoz, the CTO of Meta, said something about you. \"Working with Ami, she could have the most profound disagreement in the world and she would respond, fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that.\"\n\nAmi Vora (00:00:09):\nI really enjoy being right and then it turns out in the working world, that did not serve me so great. I think the hard part is sublimating your ego a little bit and saying it's more important to get to the outcome than to be right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):\nI love this very tactical piece of advice when you're trying to come up with a metaphor or analogy, think about what you want your users to feel when you're using the product.\n\nAmi Vora (00:00:27):\nIf we all agree that the feeling of something should be, I'm sitting in Dolores Park with my friends on a sunny Saturday, then people will just naturally build something that feels more consistent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):\nThere's also this metaphor about the hill climb.\n\nAmi Vora (00:00:38):\nFor me, the hill climb is all about the difference between a local optimum and a global optimum. You're standing on top of the hill, you're looking down, you can see rolling hills, the sheep, the grass, whatever, but then, way off in the distance you can see a mountain. And the thing that gets me through the valley is remembering what the summit feels like.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:59):\nToday, my guest is Ami Vora. Ami is Chief Product Officer at Faire, which connects independent retailers and brands around the world, and I believe is the most successful and biggest B2B marketplace startup out there. Prior to Faire, Ami was employee 150 at Facebook, where she launched the first Facebook developer platform and was later head of product for the $55 billion global Facebook ads business. She also oversaw the introduction of ads on the Instagram platform and most recently, she led product and design for the largest messaging app in the world, WhatsApp.\n\n(00:01:34):\nIn our conversation we cover a lot of ground, including building your strategy skills, how to disagree with people skillfully, being a successful woman in tech, using metaphors and imagery to rally your team and get your point across, setting up effective goals, plus a bunch of jokes in the lightning round that you don't want to miss. This was a really special and authentic conversation that I'm very excited to bring to you. With that, I bring you, Ami Vora.\n\n(00:02:03):\nAmi, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nAmi Vora (00:02:06):\nOh, thank you. I'm so happy to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:08):\nSo, when I asked you about your goal for our conversation today, you said the most amazing thing, which I love. You said that your goal is to be as authentic as possible and to show that people can be pretty messy and imperfect at times, yet still be very successful. I love that so much. Let's definitely try to do this. Is there anything else you want to add on that?\n\nAmi Vora (00:02:28):\nYeah, I mean, maybe I'll just say a couple more words on that. Actually, I feel like when I was coming up, when I looked at people who were successful, they seemed to have everything figured out, especially the women. They were all super women, where they respond to every email in 10 seconds, they didn't seem to sleep, they always wore high heels. They were just perfect and I was just like, oh, I guess I'm never going to be successful. That is not me. I love to sleep, I waste time doing absurd things all the time.\n\n(00:03:00):\nAnd I'll tell you how glamorous my lifestyle is, I'm currently working out of my bathroom. I'm talking to you from my bathroom, which is where I work from because I love my house, it's a great house, wasn't meant for work from home, three kids, two parents remote work, and it was just the place with the most closing doors between me and my children when the pandemic started. And so it just took me a while to realize that actually, it's all fine. No one's got it fully figured out, you never know how someone else is living. Most of us are winging it and learning as we're going and learning through trial and error and it's all normal. It's all fine and I can do it and you can do it, and everyone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:43):\nI so love hearing this. This is something people often want to hear more of on this podcast, because there's all these stories of here's all these successes, here's all these things I did and everything, it just always seems to work out. And we try to, we have this failure corner on the podcast where people share story failure. So I love just setting that frame for this conversation of just super being real and being clear that there's a lot of things that go wrong behind the scenes that people often don't hear about.\n\nAmi Vora (00:04:08):\nI for a long time felt like I was held back because I don't have a plan, but I realized that probably the most important thing is to just acknowledge that that is true for me. That I'm not going to be a person with a plan, and actually the thing that has consistently served me is to do the thing that feels right, go to the place that feels like home, work with the people who feel like my friends.

Just work where when I put on the code of the job, I feel like, oh, this is a place where I could really be lucky, I could be creative, I'm in the right spot, as opposed to feeling like, oh, there is an end state that I know of and I'm just going to have to work my way to that end state. Whenever I get in that zone of, there's only one outcome and I just have to get there, I'm not my best. I'm not bringing the creativity and the luck and the excitement in the same way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:03):\nLet me tell you about a product called Sidebar. The best way to level up your career is to surround yourself with extraordinary peers. This gives you more than a leg up, it gives you a leap forward. This worked really well for me in my career and this is the Sidebar ethos. When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This was a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group of peers.\n\n(00:05:34):\nSidebar is a private highly vetted leadership program where senior leaders are matched with peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives and raw feedback. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback in every step of your career journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're already committed to growth. Sidebar is the missing piece to catalyze your career. 93% of members say Sidebar helped them achieve a significant positive change in their career. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today? Join thousands of top senior leaders who have taken the first step to career growth, from companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta by visiting sidebar.com/lenny. That's sidebar.com/lenny.\n\n(00:06:26):\nThis episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents, fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams, and the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch. It's time consuming, expensive and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations or you can use an all-in-one document SDK.\n\n(00:07:00):\nMost product managers will tell you, paperwork sucks. Anvil's document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand's style and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features. For your users, paperwork often starts with an AI powered web form styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature.\n\n(00:07:29):\nThe best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides. Non-technical folks love Anvil's drag and drop builder and developers love their flexible APIs and easy to understand documentation. Build documents software fast with Anvil, that's useanvil.com/lenny, to learn more or start a free trial. That's useanvil.com/lenny.\n\n(00:07:55):\nLet's actually spend some more time here. I wasn't planning to go here yet, but this is really great and important advice. I've just, basically you're saying that a lot of your success has come from following people that are awesome. Can you just talk more about that, just what it is you've followed and seen that has helped you land in places that have worked out so well, because clearly you've done incredibly well.\n\nAmi Vora (00:08:14):\nI mean, I think a lot of us are just like, you have a spreadsheet in your head of the axes and certainly when you're choosing between jobs, for me it feels like, oh man, the rest of my career hangs in the balance of making the exact right decision and getting the exact right job. And you work through all of this spreadsheet mass of, if I took this job, here's what it would do for me, here's where I'd be in five years, etc. And I have that engine in my head also, but what I try to do is work through the spreadsheets and then tear it up because none of that stuff is actually going to determine how good I am at the job. The thing that'll determine... In my track record, the thing that has determined it is when I walk through the doors, do I feel like I'm lucky to be there?\n\n(00:09:03):\nSo for me, it's actually a lot more emotional. I try to just put on the coat of the job. When I wake up in the morning, I'm like, what would it be like if I were doing this job? What would I think about on my commute? Who would I have lunch with? Do I like them? What problems am I going to solve today? And that gives me an emotional response, which is just much more telling than the spreadsheets of, here's where I'm going to be in five years.\n\n(00:09:31):\nAnd for me, the thing that has led me",

Can I walk through and feel like these people are going to have my back, they're going to let me take risks, I'm going to enjoy spending time with them? And that's where I feel like I've always just been able to try more things and do better because a big, trust is a big unlock for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:56):\nI love this metaphor of putting on the coat of the job, of just feeling out what it would be to work there. I imagine that was something that you did before you joined Faire, which I want to talk about, but let me transition a bit to talking about Meta and specifically, Boz. The CTO of Meta was on this podcast a few months ago and he said something about you that I want to read.\n\nAmi Vora (00:10:17):\nOh, kind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:18):\nOkay, so you've heard what he said about you?\n\nAmi Vora (00:10:21):\n[inaudible 00:10:21].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:20):\nOkay, cool. So let me read this and then I want to learn from you how to do this. So here's what he said. \"Working with Ami, it was like watching an alien because she could have the most profound disagreement in the world with somebody and they would say something that she thought was not just wrong, but crazy wrong, and she would respond, 'Fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that.' And she meant it from the core of her being. She saw this schism and rather than reacting as if it was a threat, she reacted with the most genuine and profound curiosity. I just watched it absolutely tear down walls between points of view. Embracing curiosity in those moments of challenges completely changed my life and I owe that to Ami Vora.\"\n\nAmi Vora (00:10:58):\nOh man, I love Boz, what a great guy, and so kind of him to say that. I mean, I will say that this did not come naturally to me. I really enjoy being right, I love to be right. I think most of us love being right, and at least in my childhood, part of my identity was built on being the person who was right and being the person who knew everything.\n\n(00:11:22):\nAnd then it turns out that in the working world, that did not serve me so great, it wasn't great to walk into things and be like, all y'all are wrong, I am the only answer, everyone please to listen to me and stop talking. And what really happened was that someone pointed out to me that not only... One of my old managers pointed out to me that not only was I spending a lot of energy trying to think through every possible thing by myself so I could be totally right, I was often not really coming to the right answer. Other people have a bunch of information that I do not have. And so I'm just ignoring that, I was letting my ego overtake my desire to get to the best outcome, which is just, that's a silly trade off and an unnecessary one.\n\n(00:12:12):\nThe thing that changed there is me just saying it's more important for us to get to the outcome and I very selfishly just like to learn more things. And so by deciding that I already knew everything, I was cutting myself off from learning the things that other people were really good at and it's so easy to just open the door instead and say like, hey, you seem to know something that I don't know yet. Why not tell me about it? I'm going to get better. We'll probably come to the right outcome. Maybe you'll have a better time. Why not?\n\n(00:12:45):\nAnd so it was a little bit just accidental evolution in that direction. But it's made work and life so much more interesting to just be like, hey, what does this person know that I don't know yet? It means that every meeting you walk into, you're probably not going to get bored and I get bored a lot, but if you assume that every person there knows something that you don't know, then it's not just wait to get to the right answer, it's like, discover the thing that they know that you don't know and it becomes just a little bit of uncovering.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:18):\nFor people that want to learn to be good at this the way you are, a couple things that I take away from the historian and the way you're talking about this is, one is there's an enthusiasm of, I disagree with you, but I want you to know I really care about what you think. So there's an energy of like, please tell me what I'm missing. There's also this assumption that a lot of disagreement is rooted in, we just have different information, so tell me what I'm missing. Can you talk a bit about just how to, what you've learned about actually do this well?\n\nAmi Vora (00:13:45):\nYeah, I mean, I think the hard part is just sublimating your ego a",

    "content": "I want you to know I really care about what you think. So there's an energy of like, please tell me what I'm missing. There's also this assumption that a lot of disagreement is rooted in, we just have different information, so tell me what I'm missing. Can you talk a bit about just how to, what you've learned about actually do this well?\n\nAmi Vora (00:13:45):\nYeah, I mean, I think the hard part is just sublimating your ego a little bit and saying it's more important to get to the outcome than to be right. And I think all of growth is a battle with yourself, but this is one of the hardest ones because we all want to be right, we all want to protect ourselves and it served us, many of us for so long to be right. I just try to think about the feedback loop of, I think all of life is feedback loops, so I just started to think about the feedback loop I'm creating of like, I was curious about something. I learned something new, we got for a better outcome. Probably the other person felt better as well as I felt better. It's all positive feedback and you do that a couple of times and the positive feedback far outweighs the desire to be right because now we're more right, we're more right together. And so just building that as a practice of just noticing how much better things can get when you can be open to them, has been really fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:43):\nWhat do you think of this phrase that he used that he remembers? Is that a phrase that you find useful? Just fascinating, you have to tell me more why you think that.\n\nAmi Vora (00:14:52):\nI do think that is a word that I say a lot. I do say that a lot, because it's true, it's fascinating that someone to look at the same movie that I was looking at and come away with a totally different understanding of the plot. I could sit in the same meeting as other people and they would leave with just a different retelling of what happened, and that to me is fascinating. Isn't that surprising, that we can all see the same, what we think are the same facts and walk away with a totally different narrative? And when you really go deep into that and you just understand how people see the world, and that is helpful. I'm curious about things, I like to know more things, and so that just helps me know more things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:36):\nI feel like the hardest part of this for people is you hear someone say something, say, okay, so our mutual friend, Dan Hockenmaier, he's in a meeting and he just says something that you are just like, no, because he's got influence. He's a big deal at Faire. Most people have this visceral reaction of like, oh no, I really don't think that's a good idea. Is there something you've learned about controlling that bodily reaction of like, oh, and then just being positive about it?\n\nAmi Vora (00:16:00):\nYeah, I do think it is just that feedback loop. It's not like I don't have the visceral reaction, it's just that instead of interpreting it as this is a visceral reaction, I got to shut something down, it's like, this is a visceral reaction and it's a chance to learn more. Just reinterpreting some of the feelings in ways that are more about opening than about closing stuff down.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:23):\nGot it, so it's kind of like a thinking you do of like, okay, hey, let me frame this and think about this [inaudible 00:16:28].\n\nAmi Vora (00:16:28):\nFor me the most important thing is just taking a pause. I think when you just take a pause, your body calms down, your mind gets a chance to breathe a little bit, and then your response is going to be better, but you got to take the pause because the immediate visceral reaction, is not always... It's going to be primal, it's going to be protective. It's just when you take a pause you're like, this is all fine, let's just learn.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:52):\nI feel like more people are going to start using this phrase, fascinating.\n\nAmi Vora (00:16:55):\nFascinating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:56):\nWhen they hear something [inaudible 00:16:58].\n\nAmi Vora (00:16:57):\nIt's kind of my tagline. There were a few years where I had to be careful about not saying it because whenever I said it, people would be like, she disagrees. So I've had to use a thesaurus and expand my words I use.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:12):\nNo, that's such a good word. Maybe we'll make that the title of this episode.\n\nAmi Vora (00:17:12):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:16):\nWhat a great title that would be. So we've been talking a bit about the bodily reaction to stuff and our lizard brain almost, reacting to things. It reminds me of this metaphor that you called the dinosaur brain and how it applies to product reviews. Talk about what that is.\n\nAmi Vora (00:17:31):\nOkay, so a lot of people on my team, they're coming in to do product reviews and they're worried about it. They're stressed out, they don't exactly know what to show, and the normal temptation is just to show as much information as possible because that way you come in and you think, hey,",

Talk about what that is.\n\nAmi Vora (00:17:31):\nOkay, so a lot of people on my team, they're coming in to do product reviews and they're worried about it. They're stressed out, they don't exactly know what to show, and the normal temptation is just to show as much information as possible because that way you come in and you think, hey, the people in this room are super smart. I'll show them the information, they will come to the right conclusions. They'll probably make a better decision than I'm going to make. So my job is to catalog the information and present it.\n\n(00:17:59):\nAnd one of the first things that I talk to people about is, okay, for the purposes of this conversation, I'm going to put myself in the capitally executive bucket because that makes what I'm about to say less offensive. Assume that executives have a little tiny dinosaur brain. We all have a little brontosaurus brain and we can really only hold three facts at the same time. We will never be able to go deep in the way that you are able to do on everything that crosses our desk. And so the best service you can do is actually do the work of making a recommendation. That's the way we're going to be complimentary. The breadth that I normally have to look across means that I'm going to be better at things like pattern matching or giving you more context or telling you stuff that's happening in the company or the industry. But what I'm not going to be better at is looking at all the information that you looked at and coming up with a meaningful outcome. That's what you're going to do and my little dinosaur brain is going to be like, okay, that sounds like a very reasonable pattern, I've seen other patterns that look like this. Okay, that sounds like an outcome, however, it conflicts with this outcome over here. I can tell you about that. Does that make sense?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:17):\nYeah, and I love that you put yourself in that bucket. You have a dinosaur brain also, it's not other people.\n\nAmi Vora (00:19:22):\nIt's a pretty bad, bad look, but it's really true. As you get more breadth, you are less and less able to go deep on everything that deserves going deep and you just end up doing a different service than the people on your team, and recognizing that as complimentary has been really helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:38):\nYou have this phrase, my manager owns context, I own the recommendation. Kind of along the same lines?\n\nAmi Vora (00:19:42):\nExactly, very similar. And I think the thing that was helpful for me there is that really unlocked what I was looking for from my managers because otherwise I wanted them to be exactly like me. If I assume that I need to bring them information and then they would come to the same conclusion that I would come to, that's very narrow. They have to be able to look at the exact same information and process it in the same way and come out with the same idea. Whereas if what they're doing is complimentary to me, then I can learn from everyone. They're going to just have a different view, they're going to have new information that I don't have, and it gives me a lot more space to take accountability.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:20):\nIs there any other advice that you could share along these lines of just product reviews? So, the big takeaway here is just keep it simple and have a recommendation.\n\nAmi Vora (00:20:30):\nKeep it simple, have a recommendation. I also think that, I think we misuse product reviews sometimes as ways to get decisions and actually, they should be ways to calibrate on principles. So what you don't want is to come to a product review for every single that you want to make. Instead, what you want is to come to a product review with one decision, but the goal of that decision is to walk out with principles about how to make these decisions in the future so that you don't have to come to product review, but you still have this consistent and coherent product that you're building.\n\n(00:21:04):\nAnd so I think when you flip the frame of reviews to being less about, okay, I'm going to bring this information to an exec, my manager, whoever, and they're going to decide every piece, you're not actually building that much more capacity in the system. You're getting fast decision making, but you're not changing who can make really good decisions. And I think you always want to change the org to constantly make better decisions, and a way to do that is when you bring these sorts of questions, what you talk about is, why did you make this decision? What are the trade-offs you have in mind? Who are you optimizing for? What timeline are you thinking about? What's the risk level we're willing to tolerate? And then you don't have to come back. You have enough information that you can take those principles and run with them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:51):\nIs there a framework or a process you use for product reviews that might be helpful for people to hear? Just like a agenda or a way of thinking about just how to set up a product review for success? Because a lot of people are trying to set these up at their companies and they're like, I don't know if we're doing this optimally.\n\nAmi Vora (00:22:05):\nYeah, I think everyone's got... I think there's so many different takes on frameworks. I don't have a single system. I mean, actually I think Boz has written about a bunch of this",

I think there's so many different takes on frameworks. I don't have a single system. I mean, actually I think Boz has written about a bunch of this, and I probably most agree with him. Where there's different kinds of product reviews, it's like, what are you trying to solve? What's the timeline on which you're thinking about for these? Is it a philosophy? Is it a strategic shift? Is it a day-to-day product decision? And then keeping it extremely short and pointed and then making sure you walk away with principles, not answers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:36):\nI think there's a lot of nuance and importance there of what you just said, which is start with the problem you're solving. What are we trying to do here? And the timeline, I think that's also really useful and important for people to hear.\n\nAmi Vora (00:22:47):\nI think the temptation is always to err toward writing more, and what I always really recommend people do is write whatever you need to write and then cut out almost all of it. What you really want to bring to any forum, whether it's a product review or a written inform or anything else, is the minimal amount of information that you need to make a clean recommendation because then you are forced to be opinionated. Otherwise, the opinion can get lost in all of this information. You can hide behind, well, all of these analyses seem to suggest, and instead you should probably just say, looked at all the data, there's three analyses that suggest this. There's one that suggests that, we think that one is inaccurate or worth taking the risk on. Let's go. Any objections? Let me know. Any new context? Let me know. That really forces you to deeply understand and take an opinion on the material.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:43):\nFinal question, who do you like to invite to these product reviews and your thoughts, rules, policy?\n\nAmi Vora (00:23:50):\nYeah, I mean I do think that usually fewer people is better. It leads to a sense of being informal and that is really useful because it lowers the bar on how complete or strong these conversations are and I'd rather have a less formal conversation faster than a formal conversation and lose three weeks in the process when we could have been building. I think it needs to be cross-functional. I think one of the things you want is cross-functional accountability. So we want it cross-functional at the leadership level and cross-functional at the team presenting level. And I think those are normally the groups.\n\n(00:24:25):\nI think the thing that gets hard is you often cut out the middle, where if it's a working team presenting to the senior leaders on something important, it's really hard because it means people's managers are not in the room and can't help the conversation or other things. And so in order to do that, you have to really have a bunch of implicit trust inside the team that everyone will get the context later, that everyone's going to be kind to everyone else and you don't need a ton of air cover, and that the managers trust their team to present in the best possible way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):\nThat is always a stressful place for a manager to be, where their success is riding in that meeting and they're not there and they-\n\nAmi Vora (00:25:07):\nIt's so stressful, it's so stressful. I think anything you do to make it less stressful is useful. But then there've also been times in my career where I would keep the room itself small, but because we were all trying to calibrate on specific principles, I would record or broadcast the reading to anyone who wanted to see it, just so they could all see the principles by which we were decision-making and get calibrated on that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:32):\nSo through your career you've transitioned from being the person pitching the products and being reviewed to the person reviewing and being on the other side. Is there anything being on this side of it that you think is helpful for people earlier in their career to know about that experience, from your angle now?\n\nAmi Vora (00:25:53):\nI mean, I think for what it's worth, I think I still do a fair amount of product pitching in the past few years because there's always someone else to convince.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:59):\nThat's true.\n\nAmi Vora (00:26:01):\nEspecially if you want to do something dramatically different. Really, I think the biggest service for people who are starting out a little earlier is that point around bringing the recommendation, really having the opinion and standing behind it with conviction and doing what they need to do to build that conviction for themselves.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:22):\nAwesome. You've done this a number of times already in this conversation, and so I want to spend a little time here, which is using metaphors and imagery to make your point and get people to understand what you're trying to say. So you have this code of putting on the coat of the job and this dinosaur brain, and so someone told me that this is just a skill you have where you use metaphor and imagery to rally a team, get your point across, get people to understand what you're trying to say. There's also this metaphor, someone told me I need to ask you about the hill climb metaphor. Does that ring",

That sounds very abstract, but I think a lot of the time when we're doing our job, when we're doing life stuff, whatever you're doing, you try to just get better and better and you optimize your current system and then you feel really good about it, and that is great. You're standing on top of the hill, you're looking down, you can see the, I don't know, rolling hills, the sheep, the grass, whatever. But then way off from the distance you can see a mountain, one that's even higher than you can't even see the top of it, and you have to decide, are you going to take the risk of climbing down your hill, crossing an unknown chasm, and then climbing back up, just to get to the same level you started at with more climbing to do to get to that summit? And that is really hard.\n\n(00:27:51):\nI'm thinking of things like, maybe the first time I saw this was like a lot of companies were really good at desktop and you could see the mobile mountain way out over there, but to get there you had to really make a lot of trade-offs in your core desktop business that you were not totally sure were going to pay off when you made it to the mobile mountain, and you had to do a ton of work. You had to fundamentally rewire a lot of what you're doing without a guarantee that you're going to get there. I mean, you can see it in life when you think about new jobs or new moves or new relationships, anything that you think about. You are giving up something that is working pretty well without knowing whether you're going to make it to the top of that next mountain. And that's been really helpful to me just to place where I am on different things, where you get the inkling that there is a much better way to do this, there really is.\n\n(00:28:48):\nIs it going to be worth going down into the valley, climbing up, keeping climbing? Is that going to be worth it? Most of the time the answer is yes, but it's helpful for me to know, boy, this feels like a slog. It is supposed to? Because I'm still in the valley and the thing that gets me through the valley is remembering what the summit feels like. When you're on top of it and you're like, this is great, it was absolutely worth it. My life is better in these ways, we're able to solve these problems in these ways. It was worth it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:19):\nI love that. It feels like a big value of the metaphor, which I love is that to set expectations, it's going to be really hard for a little bit or we will slow down what we're trying to do now, but the idea is there's a bigger hill and a bigger mountain.\n\nAmi Vora (00:29:32):\nIt's a bigger hill and it's worth it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:34):\nOn this kind of broader idea of metaphors and imagery, is there something there that you've learned of just like, this works really well, I'm going to invest in becoming better at this, or is this something that's come natural to you? Anything you can share about that skill and approach?\n\nAmi Vora (00:29:46):\nI think this one came from, I worked for a manager, his name was Eric Antino, and he was just a master of the metaphor and analogies. And so whenever I would bring him something, he would be like, how is this product going to make you feel, and when is the last time that you felt this way? And you can say, oh, I felt this way when I was hanging with my friends in Dolores Park and he'd be like, cool, tell me what it feels like, why that's the analogy, what ramifications come out of that?\n\n(00:30:18):\nAnd one thing I like to do is try to build an emulator for different people in my head, because I've just had the good fortune of working with an amazing number of very different leaders, and so he's one of the people I tried to build an emulator for where I'd be like, okay, I see this thing. I don't know how to solve this problem. How would Eric describe this? I've tried to build one for Boz, which is all about principle of decision making and principle of trade-offs. There's a few other people where I'm like, I don't know how to solve this problem. Can I load this other person into my head and how would they approach it? And that gives me a fresh lens on it.\n\n(00:30:55):\nAnd I really like metaphors and analogies because I think especially as you scale a team, narrative becomes increasingly important. Narrative can carry so much weight and water where otherwise it's similar to the product review point, where either you can tell everybody exactly what to do at every point or you can create a story that we all agree on. And when we all agree on that",

Narrative can carry so much weight and water where otherwise it's similar to the product review point, where either you can tell everybody exactly what to do at every point or you can create a story that we all agree on. And when we all agree on that story, people just know better what to do. If we all agree that the feeling of something should be, I'm sitting in Dolores Park with my friends on a sunny Saturday. You know what the iconography, the designers know what iconography should look like. You know what the communication and join pattern should look like. You're not going to build something cold and corporate, you're not going to build something strobe light, you're not going to build something flashy, but you don't have to go and make all those individual decisions. You can buy into the same story and then people will just naturally build something that feels more consistent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:56):\nThis is such a powerful and important skill. Is there an example that comes to mind where you did this really well, say at WhatsApp or Facebook of the story that carried a lot of water for you and the team?\n\nAmi Vora (00:32:08):\nYeah, I mean I think the product metaphor we arrived at for WhatsApp was face-to-face communication. Our goal there was to make it so that every person in the world could feel connected to the people they cared most about, even when they were separate, even they're distant geographically for whatever reason, we were always going to be apart from the people you cared about. And we really had to build something that would work for literally everyone in the world. People who are carrying these high-end devices in western markets who are very tech comfortable and savvy, and people in the low end markets who were carrying these low end devices, they weren't that familiar with technology, it was maybe their first time online. We had to build something that worked for everyone.\n\n(00:32:57):\nAnd the most universal form of communication is face-to-face. When you talk to someone face-to-face, you're not thinking, how do I present? What tool do I have to learn? You just open your mouth and words come out, and that's the feeling that we wanted to create. And that involved a lot of the app stepping back from communication, creating spaces that felt really intimate so people wouldn't have to think to themselves, what kind of space am I in? They could immediately map where they were in the app to the, okay, I'm sitting around in my kitchen table and people are joining and leaving calls just like they're walking in and out of my living room, but it is a family space and the family is there. Or, in one-on-one disappearing messages, you're like, cool, this is my close friend. We don't need to keep track of everything that we're saying. We're here for a little bit of banter, a little bit of relationship, a little bit of quick, what's your wifi password and stuff, and whatever's really important, that's what we'll hold onto and the rest is just day-to-day, normal intimacy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:58):\nThat is super interesting. WhatsApp, one of the main differentiators and benefits is it's super fast. And I see completely how it connects this idea of you're just like, ideas, we want you to feel like you're talking to someone.\n\nAmi Vora (00:34:09):\nAnd it's all really a small thing. It's like a typing indicator is like someone who's about to take a breath, give them a second to talk, the two check marks lighting up or someone's face lighting up when they hear you, it's just a recognition of being heard. These are all super small things, but I think they add up to a feeling of being there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):\nThat is super interesting. So I love this very tactical piece of advice that you just shared of just when you're trying to come up with a metaphor or analogy, think about what you want your users to feel when you're using the product and when else have they felt that same feeling? So interesting. And then this other point you made of making this emulator of a person in your head.\n\nAmi Vora (00:34:49):\nI mean, it sounds a little wild now that I think about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:51):\nNo.\n\nAmi Vora (00:34:51):\nThat's robotic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:52):\nIt makes total sense.\n\nAmi Vora (00:34:55):\nI get very bored a lot. It's another way to make sure meetings are really interesting where you're like, okay, let me see what that person is going to say next. Let me put myself in their shoes. Let me think about what they're reacting to and why they're going to think that and how they're going to see the world. And again, it just gives me more toolkits because it means when I'm stumped on something, I can be like, what would Rob Goldman say? He'd say, look at the dashboard. Have I looked at the dashboard? No. Okay, let me go look at the dashboard. You can load up these different skillsets that people have been so generous with sharing with me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:28):\nWhat would be the Ami emulator? What are people thinking when they loaded it?\n\nAmi Vora (00:35:33):\nFascinating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:",

Who's the person that like, oh yeah-\n\nAmi Vora (00:35:44):\nI think those are the three. I think it is like Antino's story. Story, metaphor, analogy creation. I think it's like Boz's, if we played this out, what principles are we using? And if we kept on using those principles, what would happen? And it is Rob Goldman, who's an amazing metrics growth product leader being like, look at the dashboard. I mean, look at the dashboard, which is a great central rooting part of my life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:16):\nThis was so fascinating, fascinating.\n\nAmi Vora (00:36:19):\nIt revs up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:20):\nI love this topic of just metaphors and stories and visions and things like that. It's something that a lot of people are wanting to get better at. Is there another example, per chance, that you could share of maybe using a metaphor to rally team, get things done?\n\nAmi Vora (00:36:34):\nI mean, I think taking a sub part of WhatsApp or when we talk about video calling. I really, one the metaphors was sitting around in your family room when you think about how to make calls work, where when you're sitting in a family room, you're not scheduling it, you're not, I don't know, having this cold corporate feeling, the way you do with a conference where there's heavyweight interactions, and instead there's just, you can join and leave. It feels lightweight, it feels like the space exists even when you're not there. And so just creating things like joinable calls, like that feeling of people popping in and just paying attention to whoever's there and letting them leave, but the call can flow on without a super heavyweight action that everyone needs to take. I think that was another one where we were just able to agree on the feeling and then you know what to build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:27):\nI was just using WhatsApp to do video call with my mom. They were traveling to Italy and so-\n\nAmi Vora (00:37:30):\nThat's great, that's exactly [inaudible 00:37:33].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:32):\nI experienced it, it felt great.\n\n(00:37:35):\nLet me go in a slightly different direction. One of my favorite posts of yours is called execution beats strategy every time, and I think another way you phrase it is, execution eats strategy for breakfast. I think you put that somewhere. I'd love to hear about this because I completely agree. I think a lot of people obsess with strategy and vision and got to get this right and forget that most of the work is execution. So yeah, I'd love to hear just your take and insight here.\n\nAmi Vora (00:37:58):\nYeah, I don't know if I coined execution eats strategy for breakfast, I think a lot of things eat other things for breakfast, but I'm a believer. I do think execution eats strategy for breakfast and that's something we used to say a lot at Meta. It was just the most important part and I was well-trained in that. That was one of the key lessons that I learned there, and it's because when you have... Look, strategy is super fun. You get to think about all this pie in the sky stuff. You get to think about if the world operated in rational patterns and you could predict the future, what is going to be the second and third order effect? You get to use your brain in a really fun, philosophical way, but customers don't care. Customers don't care about your fancy strategies and your five-year plan. They care about the product that's in their hands. And so anything that distracts you from thinking about the product in your hands I think, or maybe worse, takes you away from solving customer's problems today, I think is a distraction.\n\n(00:39:03):\nAnd I think one of the things that you learn is if you have great strategy, perfect strategy but poor execution, you don't win because your strategy never makes it to the market. And what's even worse is that you have learned nothing. You don't know whether it was your strategy that was wrong or whether it was your execution that was wrong, all you know is you didn't win. Whereas when you have a pretty good strategy, a good enough strategy, you're in the right direction and you have perfect execution, you still don't win immediately, but you know your execution was great. So then you learn, what do you need to do to improve your strategy? You've got the execution machine, you go back, you update your strategy, you relaunch, and you keep on doing it until your strategy is perfect and then you do win. And that's the lesson I repeatedly learned.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:50):\nIs this advice a reaction to what you",

It's so fun. It's so fun to have the word strategy in your [inaudible 00:40:11]. I don't know, we've built a mythology around strategy being the most important thing. And execution is not glamorous, it is not like white-boarding by yourself and pointing to things and coming out with the grand vision. It is the nuts and bolts and sometimes boring, sometimes grind it out work of like, you got to bring the donuts, you got to look at the dashboards, you got to rewrite the spec. You got to just do a bunch of the grinding, but that is what leads to the customer's outcomes. That is what the customer is eventually going to feel. They're never going to see the whiteboard, they're going to see that someone took the time to fix this bug.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:53):\nThis episode is brought to you by User Testing, transform how you build products and experiences with User Testing.

I guess, how do you think about this when they're trying to move up the ranks, become better product managers? Is this just a common thing that you often share, like yeah, strategy is going to be amazing, important. You got to get good at it, but also make sure this is going great.\n\nAmi Vora (00:41:57):\nYeah, I think about it a little bit in terms of proportion of time you should expect to spend. So I mean, there's no point next being on that strategy, you can't have a bad strategy. So you should spend some time, maybe it's like 20% of your time, but the bulk of your time should be confirming that strategy actually makes sense for the customers. Getting it out there, building the machine to constantly make it better, as opposed to a perfect strategy. You go away, you build it for a year, you ship it, the market has changed. Customers have changed, their needs have changed, competition, just the whole landscape has changed and you probably could have solved those problems more easily had you headed in the right direction, but done it with more ongoing customer feedback.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:39):\nIn terms of this proportion, I imagine what you see is as you get more senior, more of your time spent on strategy, less time on execution, right?\n\nAmi Vora (00:42:46):\nI don't 100% know that that's true. I think again, even at high levels, maybe the strategic directions become more important to get mostly right, but I think still most of your time is making sure they can make it to market. I think you should still be spending your time understanding what's slowing people down and unblocking it. Understanding, how is the market changing? Understanding what the broad customer feedback is, just constantly improving the system that you are building. I think that's, I mean, how much time can you spend thinking about the future, as opposed to actually trying to create it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:29):\nThat is really interesting advice because I think most people imagine as you get more senior, I'm going to have more time thinking about vision and strategy, not have to be in the weeds building things. And I love this point you're making of even as a senior exec, you're still, it's executing in a different way, but it's still execution.\n\nAmi Vora (00:43:44):\nA different way, yeah. You're focusing on the execution of the system a little bit more, but you got to stay connected, I think, to the customer and to what you're bringing to them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:54):\nI love that. Obviously, strategy is also very important. You have this great quote that I'm going to read here. \"For strategy to be useful, it actually has to change our behavior as a team to create better customer outcomes.\" Can you talk about that?\n\nAmi Vora (00:44:08):\nYeah. I mean, I think again, some of the joy of strategy is the philosophy and excitement of thinking about all the long-term stuff that will happen, but I try to always come back to, what's going to change for the customer? If we have all of these conversations and we come out with this shiny five-year plan, but",

If we have all of these conversations and we come out with this shiny five-year plan, but then we change nothing about the products that we're building or how we are building, what was the point of that exercise? It made us feel good, and there's something to making us feel good. That is good, it's important for teams to feel good and connected and this is a good exercise for that, but it's so much more powerful when it's an exercise that translates into us doing something differently, whether that's prioritizing different products, whether that's changing our portfolio allocation, like moving people to the things we think are most important now versus things that are going to be less important right now. What's the change, or coming out with a strategy that'll align people because we have the story, we have the narrative, we have the sequence. What's going to change for our customers as a result of this strategy exercise?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:12):\nMany people want to get better at strategy. Often their performance feedback is become more strategic, think better about strategy. What has helped you become a better strategic thinker? Is it just doing it? Is it a person that influenced you heavily? Is it a book? What has helped you and what do you often recommend to people to get better at this skill?\n\nAmi Vora (00:45:30):\nI think I got that same feedback quite a lot, actually, of needing to think bigger and be more visionary, etc. And I still do, frankly, actually, there's moments where I retrench way too far into execution and worry a little less about long-term strategy. So it's definitely my bias still.\n\n(00:45:49):\nThe biggest thing that held me back from talking about strategy was I didn't feel confident that I knew enough to declare a strategy. It was actually almost like a self-confidence, imposter syndrome thing, where there were people who could just say, I know how the world is going to develop in the next five years, and let me tell you, here's where we're going to be, this is the dot on the map. And I was always like, how could anything could happen? Who would I be to say I know how the world's going to develop and here's where we're heading?\n\n(00:46:21):\nAnd so for me, a lot of it was actually learning the things that made me feel confident in my own opinion. And there's a bunch of things that do make me feel confident in my opinion. When I talk to specific customers and I feel like I can build an emulator for them, like a customer on my shoulder where I can say, oh, I talked to this person working in this job, here's what they would say if I showed them this product or this strategy. So, I think talking to customers is a big unlock for me and feeling like I have unique knowledge of the customer. I think working through different product iterations of, if we thought this was the right outcome, what would it really look like from a product perspective or a product portfolio in three to five years? And which of those seems right or rational or it will go the way I think the world goes. I think asking for other opinions. Sometimes I run surveys to the leadership team where I'm just like, what percentage of our revenue is going to come from small businesses versus big businesses in three years? And if we all agree on that topic, we should just take it as the truth and we should just fill it. If we disagree, then we should talk about it and we should talk about the strategic ramifications if we chose one path or the other path.\n\n(00:47:35):\nSo for me, it was getting more comfortable having an opinion, honestly, about how the world was going to go, and also feeling comfortable that we would be able to change it when we learned that maybe that wasn't exactly right. We would have the machine, the execution machine behind it to try it out and then change and iterate and improve with customer feedback.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:59):\nAt which point in your career was this overcoming this fear and uncertainty? Was it sometime within Facebook?\n\nAmi Vora (00:48:07):\nIt was sometime within Facebook. It was really when I was stepping into the bigger ads jobs, getting to be Head of Product for Facebook ads. I got feedback, I got a lot of feedback over the course of my career and some of the stacking of feedback was basically like, you could be the smartest person in the room, but it doesn't matter if people don't like you, which is very complicated feedback and I wouldn't give that feedback to anyone else, but I took it very seriously. It was coming from so many different places, it was coming from people I'm really trusted. And so I went out of my way to be more likable, which for me ended up being shrinking myself a little bit and not being so aggressive and not being so opinionated, being more unobjectionable.\n\n(00:49:07):\nAnd the weird part is that it worked for a long time. People were more likely to work with me, they were more likely to say nice things. I mean, I take this to extremes. I wore earth tones for two years because I was just like, I got to fade back a little bit. And then at some point I actually had to do a leadership job and my team was like, well, what do you think? What's your opinion? And",

What's your opinion? And I was like, you've been telling me not to have an opinion for so long. And so it took a little bit of work to get back to, oh yeah, I have a lot of opinions, I have a lot of thoughts. It is okay for me to express. It is needed, my team needs me to have these opinions and thoughts and be a leader who can take ownership and be visible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:52):\nThanks for sharing that. Do you think that was the right approach, going and indexing far to the other end and then realizing that maybe that's too far, or do you think you would've done things differently looking back?\n\nAmi Vora (00:50:05):\nYeah, it's one of my Roman empires. I think about this every so often, way too much, I think. Especially because I talked to other senior women who received similar feedback and chose not to act on it or did act on it, and what happened to their paths were different. I think where I landed is I wouldn't give that feedback to someone else. And the way I do give that feedback, actually, because I think there is a lot of really useful information in that. The way I do give that feedback is, you do need to be able to work with a broader range of people and the way to do that is to expand your tool sets. You're not going to make yourself smaller, you're not going to be any less of who you are, but you are going to build new tools, new keys to unlock new different kinds of doors. And that is only going to make you bigger and more powerful and more expansive. But the end outcome is the same, is that you can work with more different styles of people, more different styles of problems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:08):\nI love that framing. There's an episode that's going to come out before this episode with this professor from Stanford, Jeffrey Pfeffer, who teaches a class called The Path to Power, which is how to become powerful in the world. And he actually has a big lesson that many people hate hearing, which is, you don't need to be authentic in the workplace, what you're trying to achieve, you're trying to achieve stuff and you can do... You need to use tools that you need to use to achieve the thing you want to achieve. So sometimes don't be exactly who you are and act in a slightly different way, which is basically what you're describing.\n\nAmi Vora (00:51:42):\nMore tools. I think that's a theme that's coming up, is just like, I'm all about more lenses, more keys, more tools in general because why not? Why not have access to more different styles of things?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:54):\nSomething that you were talking about subtly is the being a woman in tech and being a female leader. I imagine you've gone through some stuff that isn't what something men would've gone through. Is there anything there that you want to share or anything you've learned about just being really successful as a woman in tech?\n\nAmi Vora (00:52:13):\nI think we've talked through some of them. I think one, you get a different style of feedback and a lot of the ways to interpret that feedback. I think to this day, I get feedback that is about walking a very narrow tightrope where not only do you have to change a bunch of things and do a bunch of things that are important, you have to make people feel a certain way about how you do them and the ways that they want you to make you feel are diametrically opposite. Some people are going to be like, be more directive so that way everyone knows your thing. Some people are going to say be less directive so people can come to their own conclusions. Some people are going to say move faster because there's always more you can do. Some people are going to say move less fast because otherwise you're going to end up steamrolling people.\n\n(00:52:57):\nAnd a lot of it is personal, there's a bunch research about how women get a lot more personal feedback that is less about the content of their role and more about their style, I think that is still true and there's often a kernel of truth in it. For me, this is forever work. I do have biases toward execution and being directive and things like that, but I think learning how to interpret and respond to feedback has been a really important point for me and making my choices of, just because I'm getting feedback doesn't mean I immediately need to respond to all of it. There's a step in between where I can choose, is this feedback I want to take action on in this exact way? Am I going to look for more themes, take action in a different way, or am I going to say this is who I am and I understand the trade-offs, I'm going to do a better job of giving people context on the decisions I'm making and why I'm choosing these trade-offs. But actually this is part of how I want to operate and I'm going to keep on operating.\n\n(00:54:01):\nAnd then I think we just give women weird advice. Here's a hot take. I think we tell women things like, you need to find a mentor and you need to find a sponsor, and that's just another set of hoops that we",

I think we tell women things like, you need to find a mentor and you need to find a sponsor, and that's just another set of hoops that we have that we tell women to jump through that I don't think we tell other parts of the population to jump through. I think we tell women to unlock your future success, you've got to find somebody who has made all the same life decisions you have and who you look up to and relate to, but who also had an hour every month to be an oracle to tell you all the things you do in your life. And it feels like yet another burden where you're like, I don't know how to do that.\n\n(00:54:45):\nI had the extreme generosity of so many wonderful leaders who helped me on my way, but I didn't feel like I had this mentor and for a while it was just like, oh man, if I only had a mentor, I would know how to do all of this stuff and it felt like another weight that I needed to carry, which I didn't. I had everything I needed, people were so kind and generous, but I didn't recognize it that way because we talk about it differently.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:09):\nThank you for sharing all that. I wasn't planning on going in this direction, but this is such important advice for say, young women that are just getting started in the same product. Is there any advice you'd want to share to help them get to be the next Ami?\n\nAmi Vora (00:55:23):\nOh, I mean number one, no next Ami, they're going to be their next themselves. That is maybe the most important thing, is everyone will only tell you their own story. That's all anyone can do, but the thing that I tell people is, don't dampen who you are and your strengths, just continue expanding. Whenever you run into a problem, just add more to the things that you can do, the tools that you have, the way you can express yourself. Just keep on adding and growing and don't shrink yourself, ever.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:57):\nI love that. I want to move to a different topic. There's a few things I definitely wanted to touch on while we had our time together. One is that I hear, now this is going to be a total tangent, but I think it's really important and I'm excited to talk about it. I hear you're really good at setting goals and aligning incentives really well for teams. One of your colleagues told me you're best in class at building product orgs and figuring out how product orgs can best work with other teams. I'm curious if there's any tricks or lessons you can share here about what you've learned about how to do this well.\n\nAmi Vora (00:56:27):\nYeah, I mean I think one thing is to try to decouple all the things we're trying to do. Sometimes when you give people direction, you're like, okay, everybody just go get revenue or everybody just go get GMV. And it seems obvious because that's the thing you have to do as a company, but there's only a few places where you are guaranteed to get that and it's measurable and you can do it. And that leads to what I call toddler soccer, where everybody just runs to the same surface or the same customer set or the same exact product where you can do this and it's measurable and you end up, everyone's tripping on each other, everyone's trying, nobody really gets contact on the ball, there's no coordination. I have three kids, I've watched a lot of toddlers play soccer. [inaudible 00:57:18], it's a very fresh, very fresh metaphor.\n\n(00:57:20):\nAnd instead, one of the things I like to do is just detangle, okay, as a company, let's think about our customers. Let's think about all the things they're going to need in their journey. Let's think about how we will know how we will match our own metrics to customer success. Let's play the entire field. What would it look like if we could detangle it so that every team we had internally had a different goal that ladders into a goal framework that's actually the thing that we need to do to solve the full customer impact? And then you don't have the same swim lanes problem. You have plenty of room for people to make progress on their lanes. They all know how they fit into the bigger picture, and it just opens up a lot more growth for every team and it makes sure that we're solving the customer problem end to end.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:11):\nIs there an example that you could share to make this even more concrete from say, WhatsApp or Facebook or Instagram or anything like that, where you can share some of these goals that you've like, oh, this worked out really well? I know it's probably private information and partly-\n\nAmi Vora (00:58:25):\nIt might be trickier. I mean, maybe going back to the GMV example. Maybe instead of motivating everyone on GMV, you motivate them on GMV per surface and you divide up the surfaces, or maybe you motivate them on actually different goals that underlie. When you think about GMV, what are all the various engagements, customer engagements that lead to GMV? Can you goal on those input metrics, can you goal on number of people who visit, number of people who convert, number of people who reorder, number,",

Can you goal on those input metrics, can you goal on number of people who visit, number of people who convert, number of people who reorder, number, etc? Rather than going strictly on the output.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:59):\nSo the core advice here is each team should have different goals that are part of this metrics tree that ladder up to revenue, GMV, something like that?\n\nAmi Vora (00:59:07):\nWhatever, yeah. The thing that best matches the overall customer outcome that mirrors the company outcome as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:14):\nGot it. And there's always this balance between it's actually the best metric versus it's something they can move and understand and it's easy to watch and it's movable and things like that, right?\n\nAmi Vora (00:59:24):\nYeah, and you have to have faith that it is actually connected to that output metric. You don't want to create a metric that's disconnected just to make a team feel good. It really does need to solve the customer problem and that's reflected in company's performance, but you can usually break it down into smaller pieces and I think that breaking down into smaller pieces and assigning those out to teams, that's really helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:46):\nIs there anything else along these lines of things you've learned about helping teams work together and not play toddler soccer, beyond having different goals that all ladder up to the one that really matters?\n\nAmi Vora (00:59:58):\nI think there's value in also acknowledging that teams are going to have different incentives. Even inside a team like cross-functional teams on the same pod or whatever, are going to have different incentives, they're going to come in with different information, they're going to have disagreements. And certainly, different teams inside a company or different pillars inside a company, different products inside, they're all going to have different incentives, and I think sometimes that feels like something is going wrong when people disagree, but actually, that's just a sign of healthy tension and knowledge.\n\n(01:00:34):\nI think the thing that makes tension healthy is one, when you can acknowledge it and say, yeah, of course there's tension. You're bringing different information than I'm bringing. We should be disagreeing. No one's a bad person, no one is coming in with poor intent. Everyone's doing the thing they are supposed to do and that is a useful thing to do. And then you have to agree on an outcome that you're aiming for. If you disagree on what the company outcome is or what the customer outcome is, then you've got some structural stuff you need to work out and normally you just have to escalate it, but if you agree on like, we're all trying to move this metric by changing this customer experience, then all you're doing is having a conversation about the best way to do that using the different information that everyone is bringing. And I think that's super important to just have as a rational, open, explicit discussion, as opposed to trying to hide it or pocket vetoing or something else. Because you assume that when someone disagrees with you that, I don't know, there's something emotional or wrong about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:37):\nBut it's fascinating.\n\nAmi Vora (01:01:40):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:41):\nThere's a piece of advice I once heard from the Head of Product at Airbnb once where we were trying to find, reorg the business and try to figure out the best org and his advice and something he realized is, there's never the best org, there's just the best idea we have at the time with the here's the things we know are not going to be optimal about it and let's build processes around that.\n\nAmi Vora (01:01:59):\nI think that's my take on leadership in general. Especially as you get more senior, you can only make bad decisions. At some point someone can bring you a problem, you can recognize a problem and you can solve it, and there's so much happiness in solving that and tying a bow around it. But as you get senior, the only problems you'll see are ones that are fundamentally unsolvable because otherwise, someone would've solved it before they got to you. And so all you're doing is choosing which branch of suboptimal you're going to put your name on and describing the principles you're using and the context and the fact that it's suboptimal, but it's still the best thing. I think that's a really hard thing, is just to recognize and acknowledge that increasingly people only see you do, make suboptimal decisions and from a distance they're just like, why is that person only making bad decisions? And it's because those are your only options. All you can do is choose the least bad, the best possible for the time, for the problem that's consistent that makes sense with the framework, and that's been a tough thing to learn too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:10):\nYou said somewhere that as you get more senior, you get worse at everything because the problems get harder.\n\nAmi Vora (01:03:14):\nYes, exactly. I mean, it's a kind of dark view of leadership where yeah, you can't fully solve problems, you have to say no a lot people are unhappy with you. I thought as you get more senior, everyone listens to you and they like you and you could just say a thing and then it happens",

I thought as you get more senior, everyone listens to you and they like you and you could just say a thing and then it happens and that is not at all accurate. It really is, most of the decisions you make are not going to be perfect.\n\n(01:03:42):\nAnd I think I'm all about just normalizing and acknowledging those hard truths because otherwise, I feel like I'm failing. And if I just know that something is normal that it's part of the job, then it's not me. It's just like, okay, this is a fact of the job that I have to get accustomed to if I want to have this kind of impact. And there's something about having the impact, being able to serve the customer, being able to be part of this team, there's something about it that is so worthwhile that it's worth being terrible at everything and being visibly terrible at everything because that is the best way that I have to have that kind of impact in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:21):\nI think this is really important for early ICPMs to hear because they see their CPO and founders making all these decisions and they're like, what the hell? That's a terrible idea, why are they doing this? What you're saying is just like it's the best... Options are limited and then-\n\nAmi Vora (01:04:38):\n[inaudible 01:04:38].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:38):\n... nothing's going to be optimal.\n\nAmi Vora (01:04:39):\nYeah, no org is optimal. It's definitely not. You can optimize for the people you have and you can optimize for the products you have, can optimize for the customers you have and you can optimize for the technology you have. Those are the options that you have, and in every one of those you trade off everything else. And so you just have to know, there's not going to be a perfect where all of it works and that's okay. That is part of the fun of it. That's part of getting to do this work, is continuing to improve, but it's hard. It's hard when people, it's hard, especially when you want everyone to think you're so great at everything.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:12):\nThis idea you mentioned of as a senior person solving people's problems, feeling really good, reminds me. Rolling to this, there's this Harvard Business Review article from the '70s or '80s or something about monkeys on your back. Have you read this or heard of this?\n\nAmi Vora (01:05:24):\nOh yeah, yeah, I did.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:26):\nWhere it's basically like as a manager, [inaudible 01:05:28]-\n\nAmi Vora (01:05:28):\nYou're trying to get monkey off of your back on people's backs?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:28):\nExactly.\n\nAmi Vora (01:05:28):\nRight, right, right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:32):\nPeople come to you, Ami, here's my monkey, please take it for me and feed it for me and take care of it. And your job as a leader is to keep the monkeys on people's backs and help them figure out how to feed this monkey themself.\n\nAmi Vora (01:05:43):\nIt's a weird one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:43):\nTo get it off their back. It's very visceral. I want to talk about Faire and your current role as a final section of our chat. First of all, what was it like starting something completely new after 15 years at Meta at the various properties of Meta?\n\nAmi Vora (01:06:00):\nYeah, I mean, I was so lucky. I had such an amazing run at Meta. I got to work with amazing leaders, truly great products. And I came to Faire for the same reason that I've been anywhere, because I believe in the people and I believe in the mission. A lot of my family in India is in wholesale and local retail, which is what Faire does, and so it was also a very personal thing for me too. I felt like I knew those customers. I'm a huge fan of small businesses, I got to work with a bunch of them in previous jobs as well.\n\n(01:06:30):\nI would say coming to Faire, I mean, one of the things I always think about is that especially as you are more senior, ramping on anywhere feels terrible because you expect to be as good at your new job as you were when you left your last job, but you forget that at your last job, you were there for years, you had years to build up the vocabulary and the cultural context and the network and the product knowledge, and then you're stepping in somewhere where you know none of that, but you have the same expectations of yourself of being able to have an impact and improve things and help your team. And so I always just try to remind myself, it's going to take time and what's most important is not for me to try to come in and change everything immediately, but to learn enough to be able to change things like 60 or 90 or 120 days in the future. And so that breathing helps a little bit.\n\n(01:07:29):\nIt",

And so that breathing helps a little bit.\n\n(01:07:29):\nIt was also really interesting because Faire was entirely new to me. It was a new business model, it was a whole new set of people. It was a whole new set of customer problems. And so every interaction I just had to learn so much. I had to learn, who is this person? How do they see the world? What's the problem they're talking to me about? What's the customer impact, I think? So it was just a dramatic learning curve, which I always really love.\n\n(01:07:54):\nMaybe the last thing I'd say is, again, I was super lucky at Meta. I think I always had this maybe deep-seated insecurity that maybe I was only good at Meta. Maybe there was something about that network of people and how great they were and how well I knew those products, and maybe I wouldn't be that successful somewhere without that scaffolding. And so leaving and being able to go somewhere else and lead through change and a new place, a new customer set, a new business model, that's also been really, really affirming for me, honestly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:34):\nWell, you have a lot of fans at Faire from the people I know there.\n\nAmi Vora (01:08:36):\n[inaudible 01:08:36].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:36):\nAnd so clearly, things are going well, at least as far as I can tell. Something that I think is, Faire definitely has, and a lot of companies have, is a very product minded visionary founder. And CPOs classically last a year or two, and then they're like, ah, this sucks. The founder just tells me what to do and what's the point of this role? And it's so frustrating. I'm curious just what you've learned about, at least so far, about working with someone like that as a CPO and not just being this middle person between what the founder wants to do with the team, this building.\n\nAmi Vora (01:09:09):\nYeah, I mean, this is going to sound so naive, but I literally didn't know how important it was for me to have such a great relationship with the CEO, because I always had great relation, I was lucky, I had great relationships with a lot of people at my previous jobs. I was like, oh, of course it's going to be fine, everyone's going to let me do what I want, whatever. And I think I just got really lucky because Max is an amazing CEO, who's also super growth mindset and super open to talking over ideas, even when they involve a lot of change.\n\n(01:09:42):\nSo when I was onboarding, one of the things I always like to do is write a list of observations. I go out and talk to, I have one-on-ones with a lot of people, and I write, here's the themes that I'm hearing. Here's what's going well, here's what's not going well. And that's a way for me to both share what I'm seeing and build some credibility and trust that way, but also for people to give me feedback and be like, oh, you're wrong about this, just so I can correct my starting point of knowledge.\n\n(01:10:10):\nAnd with Max, I also wrote a parallel document of hot takes. So once a quarter or so for the first year, I'd write a document that was just like, hey, for sake of provocation, if we wanted to fundamentally change a few things, here's ideas on what we could fundamentally change. And Max, very, very well could have just been like, hey, can you please just run product? That's you're job, can you please do that? And instead, he and the entire rest of the executive team were like, yeah, let's step through these. Let's talk about which of these we should try, let's talk about maybe context you don't have for why these don't make sense or why we don't do these. And that was such a gift because I was able to build such a great relationship, a trusting and complimentary relationship with Max and the rest of the exec team, and also that he took seriously things that he really didn't have to that I have so much respect for that, and I think I got really lucky in just finding a great CEO and exec team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:18):\nIs there anything you learned about this vetting process? Say you're a founder looking for a head of product, A CPO, any advice for how they might vet this person to make sure they are good fit and will last?\n\nAmi Vora (01:11:32):\nWhat I'd say to everyone else is, make sure you just have a mind meld with a CEO. Before you decide to take the job, spend a day together, understand how they think and how they operate, and whether you're going to work together in a way that feels really high fidelity and high trust and you're going to have room. I mean, I'm not a founder by any stretch and so when founders ask me what should I look for in a head of product or CPO, I say something a little bit different, which is, make sure that you really need the level of seniority that you are hiring. I think that a lot of founders think, I need a C",

They don't need somebody who's going to scale the team or build systems like they've got enough of that. And so that to me is part of building that complimentary relationship where the founder and CEO know what they need and on the CPO side, they know that they can mind meld enough with the CEO to actually have an impact.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:41):\nLast question. You started as an intern in the PR department, I think, at Meta?\n\nAmi Vora (01:12:47):\nOh, I started as a temp, actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:51):\nAt temp, okay, amazing. And then you ended up leading Facebook ads and then WhatsApp and many other things. Can you share that story of just how you joined and how that happened?\n\nAmi Vora (01:12:59):\nWell, I had quit my last job. I knew that what I wanted to do was be involved in all the wild stuff happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 2000s. So I'd quit my last job, I was traveling around the world a little bit. I was living in New York, an extremely blissful lifestyle. I was unemployed, I was doing whatever I wanted. It was some of the best time I've had in my life, and eventually I needed a job, like you do. But it was 2007 and the only place I wanted to work was Facebook. You could hear the way people talked about these products. People would say Facebook is more important than than my car. It's like how I connect with the world. It was such a magical product, and you could hear that.\n\n(01:13:51):\nAnd I knew some people at the company and I convinced one of them to introduce me to everyone at the office. I'd made a trade, I said, I'll buy you a fancy coffee at Coupa Cafe in downtown Palo Alto, and in exchange just introduced me to everyone, everyone you know, take me around the office. So everyone I met, I said, \"Hey, I'm Ami, I really want to work here. I'll do whatever you need.\" And the only call I got back was from the Head of PR, Brandy Barker, who said, \"Look, we can't hire you. We didn't interview you. We don't have headcount. You're not really qualified.\" It was just like 10 reasons. I was like, okay, thank you for calling me. And she said, \"But we need a temp to review our press releases, so if you want to come join a temp agency, we'll tell them to send you here.\" And that's what I did, I moved out to California and I slept on people's couches and eventually they hired me full time and I didn't look back.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:50):\nAnd now you're on Lenny's podcast, what a run. It's interesting, this reminds me of another path to power rule from the Jeffrey PFeffer podcast, of networking is one of the best ways to acquire power in the world. So it's interesting that now that seed has planted in my head. Anyway, just A plug for that other episode also.\n\n(01:15:06):\nAmi, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nAmi Vora (01:15:13):\nSometimes people ask me who are working in product, what's the one thing they should do to be successful at product? And maybe the thing I would say is, especially as an org scale or a company scales, there's just a lot of distractions that get between you and the customer. And so the one thing that I would just advise everyone to do is just think about the customer, talk to the customer, be an advocate for them. It's such a shortcut to everything else you need to do in order to be successful, but it's so easy for that to get lost when you're thinking about, okay, how do I get alignment on my team? How do I figure out my roadmap? How do I convince people to join the company? There's all these different things, but fundamentally, we're here to create value for the customer. And the closer you can get to that, I always found myself the happiest because I'm building that feedback loop with the customer, but also more successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:09):\nWell, let me actually follow up on this because this is really important and interesting. There's a PM part of my brain of like, okay, but we also got to move some metrics and sometimes that metric isn't going to be moved by, we need to do something specifically for the customer, but it's something that will help the business. Is there anything there of just that balance of like, we need to move over this conversion metric, versus, let's focus fully on what does the customer want and need? Any thoughts there?\n\nAmi Vora (01:16:34):\nYeah, I think we often make things adversarial that are not actually adversarial. It is very rare for customer value to be different than a company value on",

It is very rare for customer value to be different than a company value on a long enough time horizon. There might be short-term divergences, but really, to solve, to create value for the customer, you got to be around as a business, otherwise you are creating zero value for the customer. And so I think really, just starting with the, what are the end goals and where does stuff diverge in the very short term versus the medium term versus in the long term? It shouldn't, and really thinking about where you are in the journey and how to place that. That always helps me because our metrics should absolutely be about long-term customer impact. It's very rare if those aren't, and then you're still able to be successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:26):\nIt comes back to our chat about metrics and how to do those well.\n\n(01:17:29):\nWith that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.\n\nAmi Vora (01:17:32):\nCool, I'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:34):\nHere we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nAmi Vora (01:17:39):\nThe Year of Yes, by Shonda Rhimes. I almost never read nonfiction. I love Shonda Rhimes, made an exception for this one. It's about just saying yes to things and finding your voice when you do feel like you're sometimes the first or the only or the different, and what that feels like. And it was very life-changing for me, actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:00):\nThat's an awesome pick. No one has recommended that one yet. Reminds me of an episode of Matthew Dicks, who has a Ted Talk about saying yes to everything.\n\nAmi Vora (01:18:00):\nReally?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:07):\nHe just says, Chris, to say yes to everything and his life is incredibly interesting as a result. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nAmi Vora (01:18:17):\nI watch a lot of witty workplace comedies from the mid 2000s. So I watch a lot of The Office or 30 Rock reruns. Things are just very comfortable that I already know everything, there's no surprises. I'm not great with new stuff right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:33):\nI heard they're bringing back The Office. There's a reboot happening.\n\nAmi Vora (01:18:36):\nOh really? Let's see.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:38):\nYeah, exactly. Is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love, either digital, physical, anything?\n\nAmi Vora (01:18:47):\nMaybe a physical product that I really like. I drink a lot of coffee and tea through the day and it's just, I don't know, a calming ritual. And so I have a Fellow's electric kettle, that was my big work from home upgrade. So I have this life for kettle, I have a pour over kit. I have these lovely colorful mugs that I like, that has actually just made my day-to-day a lot better, is just a little feeling of luxury.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:16):\nI love that. I think we have that same kettle. I also drink tea during every episode I have here.\n\nAmi Vora (01:19:19):\nOh, yeah. You know it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:21):\nSo we're on the same page. Next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about, come back to, share with friends or family, in work or in life?\n\nAmi Vora (01:19:30):\nIt is definitely not a motto. I feel like I know people have mottos and I'm so impressed. I'm like, you know what you are, you know what you need. I am not that person, but I have a piece of advice that someone gave me very early in my career. Actually, it was Chamath, he said, \"You can either have more energy or less ambition.\" And I was like, oh, that's a little harsh, but also really true. And I think about that, it's another of my Roman empires. I think about it all the time where I'm like, okay, if I want to have this kind of impact, I'm going to have to do the work, I'm going to have to try new things, I'm going to have to feel uncomfortable, and sometimes I don't want to do those things. I don't want to do all of that work, and then I can't be mad if I'm not having the impact. Those two just have to go together. I also have to get lucky in all these different ways, but the two have to go together and that's been just a good governor, a little bit, of how I think about what I'm putting in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):\nI love that quote. By the way, if people don't know what you're talking about when you talk about the Roman Empires, there's a meme on TikTok where somebody said that every man thinks about the Roman Empire at least",

By the way, if people don't know what you're talking about when you talk about the Roman Empires, there's a meme on TikTok where somebody said that every man thinks about the Roman Empire at least once a week. Right?\n\nAmi Vora (01:20:39):\nIt's made me think about, what are all the things I think about repeatedly without really having trigger or reason? And there's still a lot. I don't think about the Roman Empire though. That is not one of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:49):\nI also don't think about the Roman Empires, something's wrong with me. Okay, final question. You can blame your colleague Barr for this question. He tells me that you are very good at jokes, you tell very good jokes. Do you have a joke that you want to share by any chance?\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:06):\nI love jokes. There was a year at Facebook where I posted a joke of the week to the company and they're all terrible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:15):\nTo the company.\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:19):\nYeah, exactly. All right. Here's my favorite joke.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:22):\nGreat.\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:24):\nWhy don't sharks eat clowns?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:26):\nWhy?\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:27):\nBecause they taste funny. I'll tell you one more and you can choose one, you can choose which one. All right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:33):\nNo, we're not cutting anything.\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:36):\nWhat did the zero say to the eight?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:38):\nWhat did the zero say to the eight? Something like us. Okay, no, I don't know.\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:43):\nNice belt.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:44):\nNice what?\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:45):\nBelt.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:46):\nBelt. Oh, I got it.\n\nAmi Vora (01:21:51):\n[inaudible 01:21:51].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:53):\nI get it, I get it. I'm going to tell you a joke. I just heard a standup share. How do you turn an egg into a vegetable?\n\nAmi Vora (01:22:02):\nI feel like if you put a letter on it'll turn into a vegetable name, but I can't think of the letter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:06):\nI love that you're really trying to analyze it and get there because I don't know if it's ever possible to actually get the answer. Okay, so how do you turn an egg into a vegetable? Squash.\n\nAmi Vora (01:22:17):\nThat is definitely my level of joke, definitely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:20):\nThey're like, this is for your kid. Go home and do this joke.\n\n(01:22:24):\nAmi, this was everything I hoped it would be. I'm going to read again the goal you had for this podcast, I 100% think we achieved it. To be as authentic as possible and show that people can be pretty messy and imperfect at times, yet still be very successful. I think exactly what this podcast ended up being. Thank you so much for being here.\n\n(01:22:40):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAmi Vora (01:22:46):\nOh, thank you, Lenny. It's been such a pleasure. I write a blog on Substack at amiboard@substack.com. It's called The Hard Parts of Growth, it's just about how even when you're working in great places with great people at great companies, sometimes things are hard and that's normal. And so you can find me there. I do the same, I crosspost to LinkedIn so you can find me there. And how can people be helpful to me? I don't know, just by being great, by being kind and nice and making the world slightly better. Yeah, I think that's what we can all do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:17):\nI love that, and I will link to your Substack in the show notes, so if where people want to check it out, and I'll recommend it. I haven't done it yet, but I'm going to recommend it for my Substack.\n\nAmi Vora (01:23:25):\nThank you, Lenny, so much. This was such a fun conversation. I've really enjoyed it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:29):\nI loved it. Ami, thank you so much for being here.

    "content": "Amjad Masad (00:00:00):\nThe idea behind Replit is that making software today is very difficult. We want to make it easier. People view this as a developer in their pocket essentially. We have 34 million users globally. There's people everywhere learning to code on Replit, building startups, building personal software, personal tools.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):\nFor people building products, say, product managers, founders, what skills do you see will matter more, matter less?\n\nAmjad Masad (00:00:27):\nTypically, you're bottlenecked where your ideas are not fitting in because they need to be made and they need to be made quickly. Now, you open up that bottleneck. So now actually making things is a lot easier. Actually, you become limited by how fast you can generate ideas.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:44):\nI think people are unaware of just how far things have gone.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:00:47):\nI could imagine whatever five years from now, someone running a billion-dollar company with zero employees where it's like the support is handled by AI, the development is handled by AI, and you're just building and creating this thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:01):\nMan, the future is wild. Today, my guest is Amjad Masad. Amjad is the co-founder of Replit, an AI-powered software development and deployment platform for building and shipping software. It's one of the fastest-growing developer communities and AI products in the world. There's a lot of talk these days about how AI is changing, how products will be built, how product teams are going to operate, which functions will be more and less valuable over time. But I feel like very few people have actually seen what modern AI tools can do and have fully grasped how much you can get done with very little technical skill now and in the future. And so I'm going to do an experiment with this podcast where I'm going to do a series of behind the product episodes where we go deep on important products that product builders should be aware of and should probably start playing with.\n\n(00:01:54):\nIn our conversation, Amjad does a demo of what you can do with Replit today, which is going to blow your mind. And then we spend most of the conversation talking about the implications of this on the future of product development, on the future of product management, and on the future of startups and founders. It's a very exciting time. It's also a very scary and destabilizing time for a lot of people, and my thinking is the more you are aware of what's possible today and where things are going, the better position you'll be in to thrive in this very wild and crazy future that is coming very fast. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes, and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Amjad Masad. Amjad, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:02:46):\nIt's my pleasure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:47):\nI thought it'd be great to start with just having you explain what is Replit? What's the vision? Where is this going? What job does it do for people?\n\nAmjad Masad (00:02:56):\nThe idea behind Replit is that making software today is very difficult and we want to make it easier. One of the reasons for the difficulty is that it is very fragmented, so you would need to download what's called an IDE. It's basically a code editor. You need to download the runtime, basically Python or JavaScript, need to figure out a package manager to configure your kind of open source packages, and once you've done all of that, you need to figure out how to deploy it, how to share it. So it's a very hard process, and that's one of the ways where people get stuck and never learn how to code because it just feels like this cumbersome IT process.\n\n(00:03:42):\nAnd so the vision for Replit has always been is like, okay, making software is fun, is great, more people should do it, but so for more people to do it, it needs to be easier to do, it needs to be in one place, and it needs to be learnable. It's easier to learn. So that's the product today. It is I think one of the more easier IDEs/ environment/deployment environment on the internet, and I think we make it really easy for people to just jump in even without prior experience of coding, especially now with the new AI products that we built.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:22):\nThis episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the Fine Grained Authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases.

How large has this gotten? How many people are using it?\n\nAmjad Masad (00:06:55):\nWe have 34 million users globally. We have a large global presence. There's people everywhere learning to code on Replit, building startups, building personal software, personal tools or internal tools of the companies. More recently, we've been expanding to companies. We released our kind of B2B package in July, and that's been growing really fast. It's been really fun to see people bring Replit to work as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:25):\nDamn, I knew it was popular. I didn't realize it was that large actually. As I was preparing for this podcast episode, there's this tweet that went viral where this guy, Jevin, who I actually know. I know this guy from Canada, he's awesome, tweeted about how his 11-year-old girl built an app in Replit. She just had an idea and she built it. And the best part of it is someone in the... replied to him and they're like, \"You have to launch an app. You have to host it somewhere. You have to build a database. You have to deploy it. There's no way to do that.\" And he's like, \"No, that's exactly what Replit did.\"\n\nAmjad Masad (00:07:59):\nYeah, that's what we do. Everything that commenter was talking about, and he's right. The surprising thing about an 11-year-old building an app is not so much even the coding, it is like all the nonsense around it, and so we just abstract all that away.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:19):\nI love that and I struggled with that myself when I was an engineer way back in the day.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:08:24):\nOh, you were an engineer. I didn't know that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:26):\nI was. I was an engineer for 10 years. I was an engineering manager, and then I jumped ship into product.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:08:31):\nWow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:32):\nI'm happy I did but I do miss that. I was not an amazing engineer. I was a good enough startup engineer, so this is the kind of stuff that I would've left to use. So we're going to jump into a demo of what this actually looks like. I thought maybe actually before we get into it, there's other tools that people are aware of that help you build stuff. And so to put a finer point on what this does and how it's different from other things, you may have heard of, say, Cursor, it comes up a lot these days, just talk about a little bit about the competitive landscape of who else is out there that helps you build product.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:09:04):\nAgain, we go back to this idea of end-to-end platform for making software. So that's from writing code all the way to deploying it, and monetizing it and all of that. Now, every step in the process of the software development lifecycle, there are a lot of different tools. So Cursor is a fork of VS Code that's made that has really awesome AI tools, but that's an editor. You still need runtime, you still need a deployment environment. Actually, quite a few users use Cursor in tandem with Replit, because Replit just simplifies the runtime and deployment environment.\n\n(00:09:42):\nAnd so you have products, AI products, different places in the software development lifecycle, but really what differentiates Replit is that we do everything, but also that makes it harder to adopt for certain people. If you're at a big company, it's very easy to bring a new editor and start coding with it. It's quite hard to bring something that's quite opinionated about everything from how the code runs to how the code deploys, but that's the trade-off we're willing to make is like",

We have operations people, sales ops, HR ops. We have lawyers using Replit, and so it is democratizing the act of software engineering.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:49):\nAmazing, and that's why you're here. Let's do a demo. While you're pulling it up, you're going to share your screen and show us what this product can do. And the reason I am excited about doing a demo, and this is an experiment, kind of a new type of podcast episode I'm doing where we're diving into specific products and what they can do, I feel like there's so much talk about AI and what it's doing and people keep reading about, oh, AI can do this and AI can do that, and I feel like not many people actually see this stuff in action, especially the most cutting edge stuff. I think people are unaware of just how far things have gone and how much is actually possible, especially when someone that knows what they're doing is using the product. So I'm excited to show people what is actually possible and especially because this is going to impact the future of product management and product teams. So I'll turn that over to you. Give us a demo.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:11:37):\nAwesome. So this is Replit's homepage. You can create what's called a Repl, which is a project. We have all sorts of languages. You can pick from really in the hundreds, but most recently, and this is how Replit became a thousand times easier, is you can just describe what you want to make. So you go on this home page, we have this text box, and you can write something like make me a cool app or what have you, but a more descriptive prompt is better.\n\n(00:12:11):\nAnd so I asked RPM at Replit, Aman Mathur who's a fan of the show to tell me what PMs like to build. And so he came up with a prompt. He kind of really crafted a great prompt. So I'm going to put it here. And basically, what we're asking for is we want to build a web application. You can say what stack you want to use or you can leave it up to the AI to decide. Here we're saying build it in Node.js for product managers to track feature requests on a public dashboard. So say I have a product, I'm growing, I have a community, I want that community to engage with building the product. I want them to submit feature requests, vote on them. I want to be able to manage that. So we're talking here about the features of voting system, feature requests.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:02):\nRead a few of them just for folks that aren't watching on YouTube to give them, send some of the stuff in this prompt.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:13:07):\nSo a feature requests submission, so allowing the users to add features. A voting system, so allowing users for these features, feature requests and status tracking, being able to, it's like a kind of advance style board with columns like planned and progress, so that way the admin can kind of share with the community what they're building. And we want it to be user-friendly design, so make it modern and all of that nice kind of prompty things. And then admin controls for product manager. So as a product manager, I want to be able to really manage this community.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:44):\nI love that it builds internal tools too, not just the front end.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:13:47):\nYes. Exactly. Exactly. All right, so we're going to start building. Since this is a pretty big, big prompt, the initial coding might take a while. There's different styles of using Replit agents. I often go with minimalist prompts. That's also how I code as well. I have a vague idea for what I want to build and iterate from there. Other people, product managers like to write PRDs and more descriptive things, and you can do either of those things. The AI now responded and then said, I'll build all of that for you. I'm going to build up the initial prototype and you can tell me how it feels, and then we can make it better from there. The AI is also suggesting, adding comment threads, implementing email notifications, and so I can select those and it's being creative, it's telling me what else I could build, but for now, I'm just going to go with a prototype and then we can assess from there.\n\n(00:14:50):\nSo as you see, as the prototype is starting, you can see this progress pane where we can watch the AI doing its thing here. It's created a Postgres database. Obviously, when we're building a full-stack application, you need to be able to save things. This is one of the cool things about Replit. We have all these services, storage, database. So now it's coding, it's building the database schema. Now, it's building the home page, and it's actually quite fun and edifying to watch it build this, because you can really start to learn how to structure web apps.",

And if it runs into a problem and as things get complicated, it might run into a problem and you want to be able to help debug and things like that, it's good to be able to have an idea of what's going on, but it's not necessary. I think a lot of people just don't care about the code and are still able to build things, but we want to make the process transparent. We want to show people exactly what the agent is doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:57):\nYou're basically sitting there behind an engineer on a computer and just watching them code is what the experience feels like.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:16:04):\nYeah, and actually, the way we built it is it's a multiplayer system. So Replit has real time, what we call multiplier coding, and we reused the multiplayer system to build the agent. So the agent in the code is structured as another user of the platform. So basically, we're both coding together. So I can go into the files here and that's the thing that makes Replit really cool. I think people are familiar with some of the more chat interfaces like v0 and others where it's purely chat, but this is a full IDE where you can go and look at the files and edit them yourself or ask the AI for an explanation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:51):\nWhat's the limitation of what this can do today? What can't you do? Say you're like, you have zero coding experience, what sorts of products can you not yet build with something like this that might be possible in the future? How far does this take you now?\n\nAmjad Masad (00:17:08):\nYou can build MVPs. I think you can also start to get some initial users. I think when you start iterating on the product like large iterations, you might run into problems. For example, it's not very good at database migrations, and so we're trying to fix that. So when you're iterating on the product, a lot of the times, you're actually changing the structure of the app and that requires database migrations. And so now it might change the database in a way that creates an error that's unrecoverable. And at that point, you might get stuck, especially if you don't know how to code.\n\n(00:17:56):\nSome people will figure it out by going to ChatGPT and Claude and asking questions and I actually am really inspired about how persistent some of our users are, which is really amazing. But I think you'll get an MVP pass, the MVP where it's a product that's working and you need to change and iterate on it. It's still a struggle now, but I expect over the next few months, we'll continue. It's if you think about it's like we're building as you were building, so we're building out the agent so that it can continue getting better as our users are also building their applications.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:40):\nGot it. So what I'm hearing is it's really good at building the first version and helping you get to something that you can even have people use. It's not amazing yet evolving from there, using AI to help you make the product better and better and better and iterate.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:18:55):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:55):\nBut you can get in there if you know how to code and take it from there, right?\n\nAmjad Masad (00:19:00):\nYes or you can hire someone. We have a feature on the site called Bounties where you can hire human coders to kind of help you finish.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:14):\nThat's going to be our job for humans. That'll remain for a while.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:19:18):\nYou know what we want to do? We want to get to a point where the agent can go grab a human when it runs into a problem. I think that would be sick.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:32):\nOh, my God. It's like everything's reversed. I love it. Oh, I think it might be done. Check that out.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:19:38):\nYeah. So now the agent is asking us, is the application running and showing the homepage?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:46):\nLike it's confirming.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:19:48):\nYeah, almost asking us to do a QA. I'll just say yes. So it found an error. So there's an error here and it's like there's a dumb warning, \"I'm going to fix it.\" So in the meantime, as it's fixing it, so it can be proactive, right? Because it looks at all the errors and things like that, but in the meantime, we can use it. I just created an account. It's coding.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:12):\n[inaudible 00:20:12] It's cool.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:20:11):\nLet's see how it restart. Okay, we'll wait for it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:16):\nHow long would you say it would take an engineer to build this? A typical engineer",

I would say I'm like decent engineer, it'll take you a few days.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:40):\nAnd it took how much? 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:20:43):\nYeah, and it probably cost us something in the sense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:50):\nWow, in terms of compute.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:20:52):\nIn terms of compute, yeah. Probably, I would estimate it like 15 cents or something like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:58):\nWow. Okay, so here it is.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:21:01):\nHere it is. And the agent was like, \"Okay, this is looking good, completed it if you want to deploy it.\" But I'm like, \"Okay, I'm going to test it first.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:09):\nAnd so currently, it's living just locally on your local host.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:21:13):\nYeah. It's not local host, it's on a Replit but yes, it's the equivalent of local host. Because it's really easy, I can even invite you to this session. You can be here with me and so it's all online.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:26):\nGot it.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:21:26):\nSo let's submit a feature. So make the product prettier. That's what a typical user might say. So we have this here, you can upvote it. I guess I can't upvote it because I'm the user that created it, but created another user. You can upvote it. But now we need to be able to move things around as the admin, so I don't know how to log into the admin panel. So I'm going to ask the agent, how do I log into the admin panel? So it might've already built the feature, and it's not exposed in the right way. It'll be able to [inaudible 00:22:08]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:08):\nWhat I love about just watching you interact with this thing, and just real quick throughout, it feels like an engineer that is behind the scenes building this thing like on Slack and you're just talking to them. They built this thing, they're like, \"Check this out, I'm done.\" And you're like, \"Oh, okay, about how do I log into this admin panel?\" And they're like, \"Okay, here we go.\"\n\nAmjad Masad (00:22:26):\nYeah. So it says, \"Would you like me to help you register account?\" So it's creating an account, an admin account for me. So it's not only builds things, it also maintains things. In this case, it's actually doing SQL queries. It's not writing code to create an admin account for us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:51):\nIt's insane. I want to talk about the implications of this on product development and product management and founders, but what we just witnessed is somebody, I know you do have technical abilities, but someone that didn't have to have any technical skill, build a real product that people can use in five minutes that looks good and works, and you could keep making it better by talking to this agent.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:23:17):\nI'll tell you from our experience what we're seeing, there's so many products that are empowering developers. It's a very easy calculation to say We're going to make engineers 20% better and we're going to sell it to companies and we're going to take 10% of that value, right? That's why there's so many startups now that are just trying to make engineers a little better. Our calculation is like, well, what if you made everyone developer? What does that look like? And so when we released agent and really made programming a lot easier, what we're seeing is that people, exactly like you said, people view this as a developer in their pocket essentially. What we're hearing from customers is that I'm doing things I would otherwise have to go hire a developer, but also because the activation energy is lower than going to hire developer, whether Upwork or other places, I'm building a lot more ideas that otherwise I wouldn't have built.\n\n(00:24:26):\nI think it was it called the javelin's paradox or something like that, which is when the cost of things go down, the total consumption of it goes up, which I'm not sure why they call it a paradox, but the cost of electricity goes down, maybe you would expect that the total spend goes down, but actually total spend goes up because people consume more of it. And so I think that's going to be the case of software. As the costs go down, people will just make a lot more software to improve their lives and to improve their work and start more startups and all of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:05):\nSo to follow that thread, what are you seeing inside of",

How are people actually using this that are say product managers or just non-technical people within startups or bigger companies?\n\nAmjad Masad (00:25:26):\nOn the SMB side of things, a lot of people are building kind of back office tools. So we have real estate agents that have a lot of data, have a lot of things they want to manage in their business that building a lot of these tools, that they otherwise would have to buy, but typically when you buy, it's actually not exactly what you need. And that's kind of the problem with SaaS, like one size fits all. And so a lot of people are seeing it as sort of a SaaS replacement for in-house tools and things like that. And then when you go to the bigger companies, it's anywhere from prototyping to actually production apps to tools as well. So we've seen product managers build, like I said, like a v1 of an app and actually go out and test it with users. I can't name the company, but there's a public company that have used Replit to test a v1 of an app.\n\n(00:26:35):\nAnd obviously after that sort of works, they take it to the engineers and they're like, \"Okay, we built this thing. We think it's a great thing. We test it with some users. Let's go actually put it on the roadmap and build it into the actual product.\" So you are instead of unblocking product managers from having to need engineers for everything that they want to build so they can really build the v0 or v1 of the product.\n\n(00:27:04):\nAnd that's super empowering for them. We saw it also with marketing departments like SpotHero has a head of marketing that actually can code decently well but use Replit to build these apps, and they built a competitive analysis application that looks at a competitor's pricing and makes sure that they're benchmarked correctly. And so it's a full stack app use database and everything and it runs on a continuous fashion. And we see sales engineers use Replit to spin up prototypes really quickly. So actually someone at X, formerly Twitter is on the partner engineering side of things, and he uses Replit agent to spin up applications and prototypes for customers to see how they can use the X API.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:06):\nI love this. I love these examples. By the way, the demo, is there anything else you want to share about the demo before we close that out?\n\nAmjad Masad (00:28:14):\nSo it created an admin account. We can ask it with the username, password and kind of go into it and manage it but basically that's it. The app's complete in terms of what we ask for. We can send it out. I can give you a URL. Let's actually just deploy it really quickly to show people how you can deploy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:35):\nMaybe the show notes, we'll link to the app, you could check it out.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:28:38):\nSounds good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:38):\nOkay, cool. That's amazing. So this is deploying it onto some cloud provider. I don't know what you use, but...\n\nAmjad Masad (00:28:44):\nWe use Google Cloud. So we abstract all of that away from you, but we use Google Cloud behind the scenes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:52):\nImagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with a LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date.\n\n(00:29:26):\nWith LinkedIn Ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated 2 to 5x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply. Let's go down this thread actually while this is happening, just like what allows for this to be possible technology wise? What is the stack? Whatever you can share that enables this to exist.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:30:26):",

Whatever you can share that enables this to exist.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:30:26):\nYeah, for sure. First of all, it's all the abstractions that we built. So the way a Replit works is the very bottom layer. It's our runtime. So this is the operating system, this is the package manager, this is the language runtimes. We built a system that is able to install packages in any language, including native packages. So the AI, anytime, it needs a package. I can go here and show one of those. By the way, the AI can take screenshots as well so that it checks it works. So here you can see it is taking screenshots to make sure that the homepage is rendering. Here, you can see it wanted a drag and drop library, and so it installed that. And so it has access to all the packages across all languages, including Linux and all of that. And then the layer on top of that is the editor and the infrastructure that runs the editor, including what I described as the multiplayer editor.\n\n(00:31:33):\nAnd then we expose all of that infrastructure to the AI. And there's almost like a new discipline called AI Computer interfaces. So sort of like HCI is now a ACI and turns out LLMs need interfaces that are actually quite different than humans. They're trying to make them use human interfaces like Anthropic's computer use, but those are really expensive and you need to process all this images and video. So instead, for the shell for example, we give it sort of a text representation of what the shell is doing at a certain increments for package installation. We give it a certain tool for editing. We give it an editor tool that when it's writing the code, it's getting feedback on whether there are errors or not, similar to what a human sees, but it's actually old text just to make it easier. So that's AI computer interface, and obviously, all of that is sitting on foundation models. So the improvement in foundation models has allowed us to build this.\n\n(00:32:51):\nThe most important model that we use is the Sonnet model from Claude, from Anthropic, and it is the best model at coding. So that's the model we use for coding, but we use models from OpenAI as well because a multi-agent system. And so we have models that are critiquing. We have manager editor model, and we have a critique model and different models will have different powers. We also train some of our models, like the embedding model for search is something we trained internally. So I actually wrote about it back in '22. I said it's going to be society of models, like products will be made of a lot of different models, and it's quite a heavy engineering project.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:47):\nTo say the least. We were talking offline and you said you've been working on this since 2009 when you first built the first idea of Replit. Is that right?\n\nAmjad Masad (00:33:56):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:58):\nOh, my God.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:33:58):\nHere's the deployed app. I can send it to you and you can use it and you can see my request even on the logged out page so I can register, upload it, and log in as admin and move things around. We can see what's in progress, what's completed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:14):\nThis looks like a product. I could see designers spending days designing, passing it to engineering, PMs, having feedback, engineers taking a few days to build it.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:34:26):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:27):\nAnd here's just a prompt, here's what I want.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:34:30):\nThat's right. And we can iterate on it very easily. We can also iterate on the UI. We can say, I don't like this or that, and it'll do a good job. So we can go here, we can start a new session or a new session to create an entirely new feature here, and it'll just do the right thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:47):\nAnd it builds from that code base. It understands here's what you've built. I want to add this thing.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:34:52):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:52):\nOkay.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:34:53):\nAnd that becomes your history, right? This was the v1 and now I'm working on this new feature, and it's almost like what engineers do in Git commit messages. By the way, it generates Git commit messages for everything that it does so you can roll back as well. And so we're trying to make it so that yes, it's for everyone, but we're trying not to abstract too much away. We want to build tools for you to learn to use. And so we want power users to be able to understand the full power of Replit and it is really deep product. I think you can spend a couple of years to kind of master it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:40):\nI want to talk about implications, but I want to come back to something you mentioned that is",

So there's an entire discipline called like HCI, right? It's like how do you do that-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:07):\nHuman-computer interaction.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:36:08):\nYeah. So now there are papers about AI computer interfaces and interactions. And so large language models are trained on large stacks of corpus from the internet, but they're still kind of alien creatures. So they're not like humans, so they have different behaviors. It's unclear what's the best way to give it an editor. So there's so many experimentation about what's the best way to give it a view on what's editing, how many files can you show it before it starts to hallucinate. And right now, it's more of an art than science, but it's becoming more and more like a science.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:55):\nThis is insane. So it's a simple way to think about it. There's this foundational model, here's what I want you to build, and here's a computer to use to build it.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:37:05):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:05):\nHow am I [inaudible 00:37:07]\n\nAmjad Masad (00:37:06):\nHere's a computer with a set of tools. Here's a tool to install a package. Here's a tool to edit the code. Here's the tool to run a SQL query and also services. Here's a bunch of services you can graph from. Here's a database service, here's an object source service, here's an auth service. So you can think about it as a bunch of external services, the computer with a bunch of tools, and they're all interfacing with the foundation model.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:38):\nIt's funny listening to this how, it starts to feel like the fact that we might be living in a simulation is not as far-fetched as it may feel. Like this feels like the beginnings of what a simulation computer would be.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:37:50):\nYes. You can go really Sci-Fi on this and it's like where is it headed, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:03):\nYeah.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:38:03):\nIf we give it enough tools, let's say, I can drop it in Slack and instead of interfacing with it in this fashion, I want to interface with it in a totally autonomous way. So we actually have this feature coming up where instead of me testing it, we give it another agent. So here, instead of me interfacing with it and saying this is running or not running, we can give it another agent that is actually testing the application and then let's say interface with it entirely through Slack. And I'll say something like, give me Taylor Swift tickets the moment they land.\n\n(00:38:49):\nAnd so it'll build an app that continuously monitors the web for when Taylor Swift tickets land and there's an agent that's using the app to be able to get that. And you can imagine it has some kind of wallet or credit card. And then the moment it lands, it gets it. What I'm trying to say is that software, like agents being able to do software, is how AI gets more general because software runs our lives, runs the internet, runs our businesses. And so the more competent AI becomes that software, the more general they are in terms of what they can do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:36):\nOkay, this can go in so many directions. I'm going to bring us back to the implications for people building products, say, product managers, founders, how does this change, that function, that skill set? What skills do you see will matter more matter less? Which functions are maybe in some danger and they should start thinking about a different career path?\n\nAmjad Masad (00:39:59):\nOne interesting persona that we're seeing is the CEO, the CEO of startup. Andrew Wilkinson from Tiny is a big user. And so these people are typically creatives. They built a company, they hired people. A lot of them can't code. A lot of them are designers or product managers or something else. And you can imagine a bottleneck, you can imagine a bunch of ideas in their head, and the ideas have to translate through them talking. And then someone else listening to them and assuming that someone else actually understands what they say, and then that's someone else going and trying to build what they want to build. And also assuming that person has time, because a lot of times, your engineers are kind of stuck building the current thing. They're not thinking about the future thing. And so what gets me excited is a lot of these CEOs are building the future concept, the next product they're going to build, the next, say, company they're going to build.\n\n(00:41:08):\nAnd so it unlocks the creativity and again, sort of unblocks them from that. And look, it's a v1 of the product but it can",

And look, it's a v1 of the product but it can push things forward. You can touch it, you can feel it, you can say, okay, this really has lags and we should work on it. You give it to your engineers and they can improve on it from there. So that's one persona but I'm really excited about it, the CEO/founder. In companies, one of the things that I think is sort of hard about tech companies is these silos between designers, product managers, and engineers. And everyone feels that pain of, we have low bandwidth communication, which is language and then text on Slack and Zoom calls. And it leads to a lot of frustration, because it's really easy to misinterpret people and again, leads to siloing where people working on something, and then you pass it on to the next team and it's not really what they expect.\n\n(00:42:30):\nThat happens a lot between designers and engineers, but the common language that everyone shares is code. Ultimately in software tech companies, everything that we're talking about need to eventually flush out in terms of code. And so what if the language becomes actually working prototypes and working applications? For example, we have a Figma extension that translate Figma mocks into React that runs on Replit. So instead of giving the engineers just mocks or screenshots, whatever, you just say, oh, here's a bunch of React code, just make sure it runs on our infrastructure but don't mess with it, don't move the pixels around. And so I think it just opens up silos of the companies, make communication around product a lot more concrete, because I can give you a working prototype and that'll change how people work, if you can imagine that everyone can make software. It's really kind of a radical reimagining of not just what tech companies are but really what most companies are because everyone can be more general.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:04):\nSo say you're a PM listening to this, an engineer or designer, what skills do you think if you were one of these folks? If you were in building Replit right now, what kind of skills would you suggest folks focus on more and would you think are just like, okay, this can be less valuable in the future, don't worry about these sorts of things? And you can either pick one of those three functions or all three.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:44:25):\nI think a very important scale that's perhaps harder to develop but it's worth working on is being generative, being more generative, being able to generate new ideas quickly, because you can think about it as a factory line. So you have ideas, you have the production of these ideas or the initial production of these ideas, and then you have other people that want to consume these ideas or work with you on these ideas. And so typically you're bottlenecked by the middle part where your ideas are kind of like they're a lot of them and they're not fitting in, because they need to be made and they need to be made quickly. And so now you open up that bottleneck. So now actually making things is a lot easier. Actually, you become limited by how fast you can generate ideas, and I find that true of myself as well. I consider myself quite generative, but now I have this tool and I can build a lot more and explore a lot more and I'm finding that, well, actually, I'm running out of ideas sometimes.\n\n(00:45:53):\nSo training that muscle I think is a good thing. I think learning a little bit of coding and not the traditional way of learning coding. If you go to a coding bootcamp, they're going to start with what is Git? Actually my co-founder, Haya, was a designer. When we're first building the Replit together, she went to WebAssembly to do a coding course. And the first day, they spent this whole time on Git and she's like, \"What is that? What does it do?\" I still don't know what it exactly does, but it's like you're inverting the process, you're giving the tool before the actual problem. And so I think all of that stuff, you don't have to worry about, so things that you don't have to worry about. I think a lot of the, as a PM, as a designer, as someone who's not in your code editor every day, don't worry about all the tooling.\n\n(00:47:09):\nAnd if you learn a little bit of coding just by talking to an AI, doing a little bit of debugging, building something with Replit, running into a problem and trying to fix it just using AI, you'll learn a bit of coding. And I have this that's been called not by me, dubbed as Amjad's Law, which is the return on investment for learn to code is doubling every six months. And really just learning a little bit of that skill, learning a bit of skill about how to prompt AI, how to read code, and be able to debug it. Every six months, that's netting you more and more power because you're going to be able to create a lot more. It's going to be easier to create. You're going to be able to create a lot more complete things. So that's another skill that I think could be necessary.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:15):\nThis is super interesting. Okay, so this last point,",

So that's another skill that I think could be necessary.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:15):\nThis is super interesting. Okay, so this last point, you made Amjad's Law. It's interesting because when people, as someone's listening to this, I could see them being like, engineers are in trouble. Why do you need engineers at this point? These agents are building the code. Your point is specific engineering skills are going to be incredibly valuable and more and more. How often are they doubling would you say? Every year you said?\n\nAmjad Masad (00:48:40):\nNo, every six months.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:41):\nEvery six months, these specific engineering skills are becoming more valuable. And the idea is you don't need to know everything. You don't need to know the foundation, to build the app as much. It's more to unblock the agent and understand the mental model of how this stuff is built so that you can move forward fast.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:48:59):\nThat's right. That's right. Understanding the basic components of it, I would say, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:03):\nYeah, so it's like we need new engineering schools to teach you these very specific skills versus spending years on algorithms.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:49:11):\nAnd I think no one has done that yet, and I think this is a big business probably ready to get built. It's like AI native coding. It's totally different than traditional coding. That's why on Hacker News, there's so much skepticism about AI native coding tools, because they're like yeah, it's a glorified autocomplete. And I understand if you're writing operating system, kernels, it's not really doing that much for you, but if you're building products, it's building it for you at this point. And so if you're starting a school to teach AI native coding, you would skip so much of computer science and the basic tools, and you would teach the basic idea of how to structure an app, and then you would teach prompting and then you would teach, I think a little bit of debugging. I think debugging is quite a good skill right now to learn.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:22):\nInterestingly, if you want to be good at debugging, there's a lot you need to understand, which is basically what you're saying is that's the subset of things to understand is things that break. And to do that, you have to understand how it all works. What are servers? What are APIs? All these things. Okay, so we've been talking about how this is very good right now, building a prototype, building a v1, MVP, people can use it, you can deploy it. You deploy this app, people can start using it, and there's a scale it can reach. Do you see a future where you can build a Salesforce sized business fully Replit or other tools that can scale to hundreds of billions of dollars of value? Or is there just going to always be some limit of like, you need actual engineers and designers sitting on this thing, building it, thinking it? Awesome.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:51:06):\nIf my law is directionally correct, even if the months are not, I'm not exactly right that the duration is correct, you're going to see a compounding effect of the power. It's actually quite hard to convince yourself. But if you really convince yourself that we are on a massive scale of improvement in AI, then the answer is yes. And it's absurd to my engineering mind that I'm saying it is, but know Ray Kurzweil, this futurist talks about how exponentials are really hard for humans to grasp. And so actually when we started building the agent, I told the team, it's easy and we fall in this trap before. It's easy to build and optimize for today. In '22, we built Copilot-like thing and autocomplete. We train our own models, we optimize the hell out of them. But at some point, that modality was kind of not the right modality, which is the autocomplete modality.\n\n(00:52:11):\nAnd the right modality is actually this, I think for now, as being able to chat inside the programming environment and for the agent to create things for you. But in order for us to make that bat, a year ago the models were actually not there. The models could not do this, but we were like, okay, we're going to build for the models that are landing in six months. And truly six months later, the model started to land that are capable of this, of the reasoning that we needed and whatever. And so that was like saw it if you want, which is, oh, wow, we switched to it and the reasoning improved so much. And six months later, you have a son of you too. And so it's really almost like a six months cadence. And so if we're really on this trajectory, then I would say next year, you're able to just scale and maybe you get thousands of users paying you.\n\n(00:53:08):\nThe AI can do maintenance. We already showed the AI doing SQL queries and doing migrations, so I will be able to do maintenance, debugging, things like that. I think where it gets really tough is that when you're hitting scale and you want to architect a system that is resilient, and so that means you would start sharding databases and you would start using different queue systems and components and things like that.",

I think where it gets really tough is that when you're hitting scale and you want to architect a system that is resilient, and so that means you would start sharding databases and you would start using different queue systems and components and things like that. And I think the AI needs to have access to the entire suite of tools to be able to do this.\n\n(00:53:49):\nAnd I think that's going to be the next bottleneck. And I think the AI needs to be a lot more reliable at doing that. But I could imagine whatever, five years from now, someone running a billion dollar company with zero employees where it's like the support is handled by AI, the development is handled by AI, and you're just building and creating this thing that people are finding valuable and are paying you for it. That being said, it's worth thinking about the economics of it. If the cost of software goes down a lot, then what is the price that you can charge on software? So can you actually build the next Salesforce if anyone can generate Salesforce? And then the question is, and this is why I emphasize being generative, because I think then the thing that will make you better is by being able to iterate and improve the thing really quickly and generate new ideas.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:01):\nAnd stay ahead of all the other people building these tools so quickly. Oh, my God. An interesting other kind of mental model I'm seeing as you talk about this sort of thing is not to offend religious folks, but there's this concept of God of the gaps. I imagine you've heard that where it's like God explains all the things that we don't yet understand. And over time that kind of space shrinks and God's like all the things we don't get yet, those gaps. That was God that proves there needs to be a God. And it feels like right now, humans are the gaps in these tools or these agents you talk about that you can hire within Replit are fixing these little gaps. And over time, AI will fix these things themselves.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:55:44):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:44):\nAnd these gaps will shrink.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:55:47):\nUnless we hit some fundamental limit and the current regime of AI, which I'm not an expert about how far transformers could scale, but I feel like we found the thing that could scale pretty far, but maybe there are limitations in data or other things like that that we could be surprised by. But if there isn't, then we are on a massive trajectory of removing these gaps quickly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:23):\nYeah, very true. We have no idea. We keep thinking it's just going to keep going, but maybe it'll stop at some point. I could keep going and going, but I think we should also let people go play with these things and process all the things we've been talking about. Is there anything else that you think might be helpful for folks to think about or learn or study?\n\nAmjad Masad (00:56:43):\nI'll give advice to founders or leaders at companies. The way we work is going to change rapidly, and it's important to be resilient to that change. One thing that I think is really difficult now is having roadmaps, especially if you're doing anything in AI, but really anything that AI could affect, you want to be able to react to it really quickly. And so when the Anthropic drop the computer use set of capability, we slaughtered our roadmap because we don't really have an explicit roadmap. We immediately jumped on it and started building things and we launched some things around it. We're going to be doing more with it, but there's going to be capabilities that are going to drop. And you want to really, in some cases, if it really affects your business, you want to be able to jump on it really, really quickly. So being agile, not being stuck with roadmaps, being able to just say, oh, we're just going to switch priorities right away, is going to be super important.\n\n(00:57:59):\nNot being, like I said, with silos at Replit, there's so many people that are on the scale of designer to engineer, designer, product manager. Actually, I mentioned Amman earlier. He started as a designer at Replit, and now as a product manager. We have people who start as designers, become engineers, and we have people in the middle and we're comfortable with that design engineers that fit at different parts of the scale. And the design engineers go to the design correct meetings and some designers go to the engineering meetings. You got to be fluid because again, when designers can code and engineers can design, I mean it really becomes, you can't have a lot of structure around that. So you want to build a culture and you want to build an environment or milieu that is really, really flexible, which is uncomfortable for a lot of people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:03):\nMan, the future is wild. Everyone's a hybrid person now. Let me just actually double down on what you just said, which I think is really interesting. It's almost like if you're an engineer, where your skill set will become most valuable is unblocking these AI tools and knowing debugging and figuring out how to allow it to go further and further and further. Within PM and design land, based on what you're describing, where the skills will become more valuable is generating ideas, almost like finding opportunities, discovery, finding what problems need to",

Okay, I'm jot. This is incredible. My mind is racing. I've got to go build some apps immediately.\n\nAmjad Masad (00:59:58):\nYes, you've back. Love that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:00):\nI will do that. So just to leave listeners with a couple things. One is just, what should they know? Where do they find you? How do they try Replit? Anything else other than just go to replit.com?\n\nAmjad Masad (01:00:10):\nYeah, just go to replit.com. It's an open beta right now. We're kind of quickly improving and going to exit beta I think in a few weeks. But if you're comfortable testing something that's not perfect, go to replit.com. If you subscribe to our core plan, you should be able to access the agent and start using it. And we are, I think the place where we're most active is Twitter. So Twitter are like X, the handle Replit, R-E-P-L-I-T or my handle @amasad.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):\nOh, yeah. One other thing I wanted to make sure we had a chance to touch on is you're working on something new, something that's coming in the very new future, maybe the day this episode drops. Talk about that.\n\nAmjad Masad (01:00:56):\nAll right. So depending on when the episode is coming out, this could be the first time people hear about it. But we have this product called agent. It is sort of high agency, does everything from setting up the project and all of that. And so now, we are working on assistant. Assistant is let's say the cousin of agent. It is a little less powerful but a lot more controllable. You can focus on features or areas of the code that you want to change and you still don't have to know how to code, but it is a lot more manageable and it is a lot faster.\n\n(01:01:38):\nSo you saw how it took some time to kind of create the project and code some of the things. Assistant is in the order of milliseconds and seconds to be able to respond to you. And so again, as I talk about the idea of tools, we want people to have as much power and autonomy as possible. And so there are certain instances where agent is the best. It's going to do the debugging for you, it's going to create the database for you. But if you want more control, assistant is going to give you that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:09):\nJust so folks totally understand what this is going to do for them. What's the mental model for what this is? If it's like a person, we're helping you out.\n\nAmjad Masad (01:02:17):\nAgent is like having a developer work. You give them the PRD, right? And they're going to go and build the thing. Assistant is like you're sitting next to them. So they built the thing and now you walk over to their desk and you say, let me move this button. Three pixels to the left. Let me change this thing. So small increments of changes that you want happen really quickly and you want it reliably, that will give you that. So it's just much faster iteration on UI and things like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:58):\nIncredible. The future is wild. Final question I always ask everybody, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAmjad Masad (01:03:04):\nCome work at Replit. We have a PM role. I think up if you're product manager. We're hiring engineers and product managers. So come work at Replit or refer someone to Replit, especially if you're like our tools and you want them to get better. The best way to do that is to get us great people we can hire.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:25):\nWell, you're about to get a flood of product managers applying.

So many knowledge work jobs are going to change massively. I think the fundamental question is, do all jobs just become a single prompt?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):\nToday, my guest is Andrew Wilkinson. Andrew is the co-founder and CEO of Tiny, a holding company that's often called the Berkshire Hathaway of the internet. They own over 40 businesses ranging from Dribble to WeCommerce to the AeroPress coffee maker, and they focused on buying profitable businesses from founders and holding them for the long term. Andrew and his co-founder bootstrapped the business from zero to hundreds of millions of dollars in value, and Andrew personally was worth over $1 billion at one point. In our wide-ranging conversation, we cover a bunch of strategies for coming up with a good business idea, what common business ideas you should avoid, his experience automating much of his work and life using AI, and what that means for employment in the near future. Also, what he's learned about happiness and money and how they're not directly related, and also how getting diagnosed with ADHD and then taking SSRIs was the thing that most impacted his happiness in life.\n\n(00:01:46):\nThis is both a powerful and also a very tactically useful conversation and I'm really excited for you to hear it.

There's so much that I want to talk about and I want to start with a topic that I know that you think a lot about and that it's also in the minds of a lot of people, which is coming up with a great startup idea and this is something that a lot of people are thinking about right now because AI makes it so easy to actually build your idea into something real, and I feel like this is something you spent a lot of time thinking about. I feel like you've actually started and run more companies than, I don't know, maybe anyone else in the world. I feel like you're in the top a hundred, top 10, something like that. I don't know.",

I feel like you've actually started and run more companies than, I don't know, maybe anyone else in the world. I feel like you're in the top a hundred, top 10, something like that. I don't know. Does that feel right?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:04:51):\nI've definitely had a lot of experiences and I've probably started or been involved with 75 different projects or businesses where I've been a primary contributor and I wouldn't say that's anything to brag about because I've been an inch deep in a mile wide. So that's been in a lot of ways kind of my Achilles heel is I get too excited about ideas and I start too many businesses, but as a result I've seen almost every business model under the sun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:18):\nAmazing. Okay. Yeah, I think the benefit is for us is we get to learn from your experience. Let me just ask you this question, what is your best advice for coming up with a great startup idea?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:05:28):\nUltimately the best thing is something you're going to be interested in, but I think a mistake a lot of people make is they choose something that everybody is interested in. So for example, they say I don't know anyone that has hadn't had the thought, man, I would love to start a really cool restaurant or I want to have a cool cafe or something. And in reality, what they think about is how cool would it be to come up with an amazing logo or all fun stuff, design the menu and stuff. But in reality, operating those businesses is miserable and it's also a very hard business because every morning millions of people wake up and they go, I should start a cafe. But on the flip side, almost nobody wakes up every morning and says, \"You know what? I'd love to start a funeral home,\" or \"I would like to start a pest control business,\" or \"I should start software that helps people fill out forms for the government.\"\n\n(00:06:26):\nAnd Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's longtime business partner, has this amazing quote. He says, \"Fish where the fish are.\" And he gives this example, he says, \"If you're a fisherman and you see a large pond and all around the pond, there's a whole bunch of fishermen and they're all elbowing each other out of the way. They're all using the best lures, the best fishing line, they all have amazing strategy. You actually want to walk off into the forest and find a small fishing hole with lots of fish and very little competition. And I think that's probably the most important thing in business is actually to find those niches where you can actually make real money because competition equals lower margin. The more competitors there are, the lower your prices have to be and the more competitive the business is ultimately.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:19):\nIt doesn't feel intuitive to go after small markets and to find niches. So let's just follow that thread. Well, why is that actually a source of some of the best ideas starting really small and niche?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:07:30):\nI don't necessarily think it has to be something that is small forever, but it has to be something that like I think about if you're a first time entrepreneur or a student or something, you don't want to walk into the gym on day one and try and deadlift 300 pounds. So when someone comes to me and they're a first time entrepreneur and they say, \"I'm going to make the next great AI company,\" or \"I'm going to launch a new bank,\" or something like that, something that is very, very rigorous and complicated and highly competitive and regulated, I think that is the equivalent. I think you really want to take the baby weights and start slowly building your muscle. And I think about my own experience starting a business, I was so lucky because the first business I ever started my web design agency, which became Metalab, that was so easy and it worked immediately because all I had to do was know how to build websites and be able to talk to potential customers.\n\n(00:08:33):\nAnd then once they said, \"Yes, I will pay you $5,000,\" I just had to send them an invoice, do the work, and that was it. It was a very simple business. And because of that, I got immediate positive feedback and I built my own narrative. And my narrative was, \"I'm good at business, I can do this, keep going.\" And then I went off and I started taking my money that I made from that original business and that's when I fucked up. So I went out and I started a pizzeria and I lost all my money. I started a designer cat furniture business, a online DJ school, a skin cream business, all of these things. I've just lost all my money almost immediately, but because I had that first win I kept on going. And I just think it's so critical that people choose a business where they get that initial win.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:22):\nOkay, this is a great topic. This is just like how do you avoid creating a job for yourself that you hate? There's a lot of business opportunities and ideas that like, \"Yeah, you can make this work,\" and then it works, and then you're stuck doing this thing running a restaurant. My wife tells a story where a friend started a coffee shop and then he's like, \"I thought I was starting a coffee shop, but I'm just replacing milk and buying milk all day.",

My wife tells a story where a friend started a coffee shop and then he's like, \"I thought I was starting a coffee shop, but I'm just replacing milk and buying milk all day. That's my job now.\" So just kind of along those lines to help people avoid creating a beast that they didn't expect any advice for Just how to know this is maybe even though this may work and make money, you probably don't want to be spending your life doing this sort of business.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:09:59):\nSo I just started a pressure washing business. I was speaking at a local business school and after I spoke, one of the kids walked up to me and he said, \"Hey, I'm an entrepreneur. I've started two or three businesses in the past doing landscaping and I'm not enjoying school.\" And so just on the spot, I said to him, \"Why don't you drop out and we'll start a business together?\" And I'd been cooking on this idea of a pressure washing business because I'd studied that industry a little bit and I knew a few friends who'd done it in other cities. And I had this unfair advantage, which is I owned a whole bunch of media properties where I could advertise it for free basically. And so we started this business and I think for him, he kind of had this moment of, do I really want to be washing people's driveways for the rest of my life?\n\n(00:10:47):\nAnd what I said to him is, \"Look, if this gets to scale, you'll never touch a pressure washer unless you want to.\" If the business can get big enough where you can have employees, he can just focus on sales or digital marketing or whatever aspect of the business that he really loves. And I think that's the biggest thing that a lot of entrepreneurs miss. They say, \"I don't want to do that for the rest of my life. I don't want to be in the back of a dry cleaner dry cleaning clothes.\" And to me it's just a question of scale. I think the cafe is a great example because a cafe, if it doesn't get to a reasonable scale is just a job.\n\n(00:11:26):\nThere's a big difference between a business and a job. I think if you could start a pressure washing business where you're the only employee, yeah, that's a job, but if you can get to a scale where you can drive 10 leads a day, then you don't have to do any of the pressure washing and you just do what you love. So I think a lot of people have this kind of Protestant work ethic where they think, well, I've got to be the person to do everything. And I think they really need to lean into what I call lazy leadership, which is how do I get away from the things I hate as quickly as humanly possible? How do I be Teflon for tasks?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:00):\nIt's interesting that this business is non-software related at all, this pressure washing business. So I guess just for folks that are coming up with ideas, and I imagine most ideas are there's a pull to make it software oriented, something AI is going to help build for you and help you run. What's your calculus on just going down a direction of real world physical business, like a restaurant power washing business versus a software just like what are the benefits of that direction when should someone actually seriously think about doing a business like a power washing business?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:12:30):\nI think if someone's listening to this podcast, odds are they're someone who's kind of a digital native. And I think the question is, what's your unfair advantage and what are you great at? So for me, I think I have reasonably good taste. And so what I could do is I identify and I knew enough to identify great design and development talent, but mostly I was lucky because I was a talker. I was good at meeting with clients and selling myself. And so ultimately my highest and best use my superpower was sales. And so that can be applied to anything, anything where you need to go out and you need to sell a customer. And so really it just comes down to what do you get drawn to and then how do you find the profitable business within that? So here's an example. A friend of mine, he owns a restaurant and he said, \"Oh, I love it. I'm so passionate about it. It's this stunning beautiful restaurant in my hometown.\"\n\n(00:13:32):\nAnd he said, \"But it's really just a job for a few different people and we can't make any money at it, but I've been noticing that there's all these vendors that service the restaurant and those guys are making a killing.\" And so he told me about a business that cleans grease traps, another one that cleans exhaust vents for kitchens. So I think looking around and seeing where your passion is and then sniffing around within it, probably somewhere within your passion, there's an opportunity. So for example, I love movies. My happy place is a dark theater. That's the best way for me to de-stress is go to a dark theater and watch a movie and get lost in it. And probably about four or five years ago, I was like, \"Man, how cool would it be to invest in movies in some way to be a part of that creative world?\"\n\n(00:14:26):\nAnd so I started looking into funding movies and I realized that when you fund movies, like 90% of the time you lose all your money. And even if you",

And even if you do make some money, you rarely make a good return. But I spend a bunch of time understanding the industry and learning about it. And then two years ago I was in New Zealand and I met the founder of Letterboxd and I realized, \"Oh my God, this is a business where this has a moat, so it has a network effect, it's a huge social network for film reviewers. It's something I'm passionate about and it's something that we can buy at a fair price.\" All those things came together and I was like, \"Oh my god, I can invest in film now.\" In the same way I used to be a barista, we ended up buying the AeroPress coffee maker company. So I follow my passions and spend a long time learning different industries and then I find the profitable niche within.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:19):\nOkay, and this is a great takeaway essentially when you're thinking about startup ideas, make sure there's some connection to something unique to you where you have some unfair advantage. This makes me think about Brian Armstrong. I saw him do a talk once and he gave this really amazing insight about why Coinbase did well and why he started Coinbase. And it's because if you look at his background, he had this really rare Venn diagram of background of computer science and I think it was cryptography and economics, which is the exact set of skills you need to start something like Coinbase. So I think the tip there is just what is that unique Venn diagram of skills in your background and just ideally what you're building connects to that and gives you an unfair advantage.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:16:02):\nWell, yeah. I just met another UVic student at the local university student. She is interested in marketing and so she's gone out and she's found some local clients, so small restaurants and stuff and managed their social media and she said, \"Yeah, it's okay. I can make a thousand bucks a month, but it's a lot of work,\" and the owners really want a lot for their money. And I said, \"Well, if you just pivot that idea just ever so slightly, and instead of doing restaurants, you did realtors or wealth managers who have quite a large marketing budget and are used to spending serious money and it only has to work a little bit to make a lot of money for them. Those people, you can charge $5,000 a month.\"\n\n(00:16:44):\nSo I think often it's you find your passion, your skill set, you zero in, and then you just kind of pivot and you find the most profitable way to do it. When I started my web design firm, I started mostly with local and small projects, but very quickly I found a job board in San Francisco where startups would share projects they needed help with. I could charge five times the amount for five times less work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:09):\nThis point about fish where the fish are I think is really important. You can start something that's awesome that you love, that you're so excited about, but nobody needs it. Talk a bit more about just what that looks like. What have you seen when you're thinking about ideas that tell you that there's fish but also not overfished as you pointed out?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:17:25):\nI think it's hard like Warren Buffett has this great quote, \"I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor and I'm a better investor because I'm a businessman.\" And I feel like in order to know what problems are valuable to solve, you kind of need to have valuable problems. So it's a bit of a hard thing because I remember when I was like 20, I would say, I hate how all the cat furniture I can buy for my cats is I bet people would pay a lot of money to solve this, but I didn't understand anything about the realities of that business model. I didn't understand how little people were actually willing to pay. I didn't have a enough life experience to go, \"Yes, that's actually a worthwhile opportunity.\" And I think that being able to know what people would pay to solve the problem realistically is incredibly valuable.\n\n(00:18:20):\nSo my example of a realtor selling a house, because I've studied that industry, I know that a realtor can make like 20 to $50,000 selling a single house. So I can intuit that they'd be willing to spend a lot of money if I have a unique way of getting them clients that'll buy houses that'll convert at a high conversion rate that is worth $5,000 a lead maybe, right? So I think you kind of have to understand the problem in depth before you really know. Because when I was starting out, I would go down every rabbit trail, every infomercial idea I had I would think was genius.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:59):\nOr people, I don't know, that don't have this experience, which is most people. Is there one thing you do, maybe a heuristic that gives you a sense, maybe there's something here, maybe there's a lot of fish, maybe it's a value of prompt or no, the soul tell me it probably isn't.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:19:12):\nNo, unfortunately, I think it's mostly gut.

I mean Munger and Buffett talk about having a whole bunch of mental models in your brain and they form a latticework, right? And they all kind of piece together. And I feel like for me, there's so much of this that is, it's almost like I'm an AI model and I've trained on all this data of what works and what doesn't and what's a good moat and what's a bad business, et cetera. And when I see it, I just immediately know. I mean, I think all entrepreneurs are so lucky now to be able to go into Claude or ChatGPT and just say, \"Hey, I'm thinking about starting a Botox clinic. Can you break down the numbers? Is this a good business? What's hard about it? What is the regulatory moat? What would my payroll look like?\" I didn't have any of that and so I started so many incredibly stupid businesses, but I think there's no excuse at this point. You should be able to do it with AI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:07):\nThat's a really good tip actually. Then there's this point you made about boring is good. That's a really good piece of advice. A lot of people are going after flashy stuff, things they condemn on Twitter. Your advice here is boring is actually a really good thing because fewer people are going after it. Is that the general tip?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:20:22):\nTotally. I mean, so I started this business, one of my first called Flow and Flow was basically Asana before Asana came out. So it was a way to manage your to-do's and projects with your team in a web app and we basically did the thing. We made the mistake that so many entrepreneurs make, which is to go after an industry that everybody goes after just like cafes. Everybody has the idea, man, I wish I could design my own project management system or my own to-do system. And not only that, but everybody loves new things. They love jumping around. I know me personally, in the last three years, I've probably used three different productivity systems and I love jumping around in them and I didn't understand that and I ended up losing $10 million trying to compete with venture-backed businesses and bootstrapping.\n\n(00:21:17):\nIt was all my own money, poured $10 million, lit it on fire trying to compete with Asana because I didn't understand how the business world worked really as they had raised hundreds of millions of dollars and they were run by the co-founder of Facebook and it was a little bit like, I'm Fiji and I'm deciding I'm going to invade the United States in retrospect, just completely silly. Now on the flip side, if I'd taken that same amount of energy and I'd instead focused on, let's see, what's a really boring one I've heard about, there was a business I saw recently.\n\n(00:21:52):\nThey were making $30 million a year and all they did was help people fill out forms to get government assistance in certain programs. So it'd be like your uncle is disabled and you need to access government funding. The process to do it is incredibly time-consuming and miserable and you have to fill out all these forms. They just have software that fills out the forms for you and it says, look, you're going to get $20,000 as a grant, pay us a thousand bucks, and that is such a boring, nobody wakes up and goes, \"I want to make form filling software,\" but I think they would if they could make 20 million a year\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:29):\nAlong these lines of just bad ideas, things people shouldn't start, what are a few ideas that you think everyone thinks is going to be a great idea and then they do it and then they always fail?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:22:37):\nWell, I think the biggest mistake, I can speak from my own experience, the biggest mistakes I've made business-wise have been going into business models where other people have repeatedly failed and thinking, I can do this better. So for example, me and one of my best friends about 10 years ago, we really wanted to start a bar. We just thought it'd be so cool to have a bar where us and all of our friends could go, we thought it'd be great for the city. We thought we can run this really high margin because we're tech guys, we know how to build systems, we're good at business, and we were utterly humbled. We realized that we didn't know anything about business compared to someone who runs a pizzeria. If you think about it, like my example earlier of if you run a software company, what has to happen?\n\n(00:23:24):\nYou have to hire a bunch of nerds, they need internet connections and computers and you need to pay them and you need to coordinate online and everyone can work asynchronously. Nothing has to go right. It's not that complicated, at least at small-scale. A pizzeria, it's like if the baker doesn't wake up at three in the morning and start prepping dough, the entire thing is effed and all along the way there's a hundred different failure points from front of house, back of house, the deliveries, arriving on time, all this logistics. And so I think it's been stuff like that. I mean also I got into the news business, the local news business. I ended up buying an old paper in Vancouver and it's the exact same",

It's like you can't take a brilliant management team and change a bad business model. Ultimately the business model wins.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:20):\nThis is really good advice. Basically if there's a bunch of dead bodies in that space, there's probably something there that keeps killing them that you're probably not aware of until maybe somebody figures something out, right? Once in a while, once in a blue moon, someone's like, \"Okay, here's how we do this and then it works.\"\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:24:34):\nWell, look at Instacart. When Instacart came out, everyone said, \"Well, Webvan failed. This is never going to work.\" And we still don't necessarily know if Instacart is a great business. I don't know, I haven't studied it, but I think it was like, okay, enough technology has changed that it can happen, but would it be easier to start Instacart, Amazon or Coupang or would it be easier to start an enterprise SaaS software company? Definitely the enterprise SaaS software company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):\nI see. So this is I guess is the advice there. The thing that is easy to start is the thing you should not do because everyone's going after that.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:25:10):\nWell, it goes back to my gym analogy of if you're going to deadlift 300 pounds, trained for 15 years, you should have already had three startups and they should have worked and you've really built up the reps. And I think that if I was going to start Instacart, that's different than someone who's 20 starting it. Not that I would be good at it, but at least I would know what I'm getting into.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:32):\nLet's talk about something that is this endless debate on Twitter. Maybe it's a false dichotomy between lifestyle businesses, bootstrap businesses, this idea of not raising money, just making revenue, living off the revenue versus venture-backed venture scale companies feels like you're very good at the first bucket and a lot of people, this is their dream, \"I'm just going to start something. I'll start a lifestyle business, make a few million a year, never raise money. Who needs VCs? VCs suck.\" Advice for deciding which route to go with an idea you have.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:26:03):\nWell, I think it's just not true that a \"lifestyle\" or bootstrap business can't get huge. I mean, we bootstrapped the entire business and now across all of our companies we do almost $300 million in revenue. And the whole time I had been focusing on taking, starting small businesses, small ideas, simple ideas, often buying small companies and watching them grow really big. And I think that the only difference between what we do and what a venture capitalist does is the level of tolerance of burning money on fire. And I just haven't seen that If we choose the right businesses that aren't in incredibly competitive markets or where they have some sort of moat. So what I mean by that is a great brand or a network effect like a social network or something like that, I don't feel we're holding them back by not letting them light up a bunch of money on fire because these things naturally grow.\n\n(00:27:12):\nThe numbers, I mean they're like balloons, they just go as long as we don't mess them up too much. So I think the decision ultimately comes down to how hairy do you want your big, hairy, audacious goal to be? And if your big, hairy, audacious goal is I'm going to start the next satellite business that creates some sort of crazy technological revolution. Yes, you're going to have to raise a venture capital unless you're already a billionaire or something like that. But if you're wanting to just tinker and solve a problem that you think is not going to be hyper-competitive, so for example, that form-filling thing or software that just does a narrow thing that doesn't require 20, 30, 40 million to be lit on fire before it can make money, then you can have a wonderful life and build a wonderful company that can scale into the hundreds of millions of dollars if you play your cards right without ever raising money.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:09):\nPer the story you shared with Flow where you're competing against a venture-funded company, if there is a venture-backed company in this space, is the advice you're not going to win competing with them most likely and try to do something else.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:28:22):\nWell, look at Things. Do you know Things?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:25):\nI have used Things\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:28:26):\nI do too. It's awesome. Things still exist and Things has existed for 20 years. It's run by I believe one or two or three people. It's not a big team, certainly under 10 people, it was, I believe, bootstrapped and it's just consistently delivered an exceptional product and built up a loyal following. They have their 10,000 true fans who use it, and that's enough for them, but they don't do a lot. They've been very intentional. They don't do any AI stuff,",

They're not on Android. They're very focused and I think they have succeeded. But the question is, what would an MBA or a business professor say about their success? If the measure of success is did they maximize taking as much market share as possible and grow to be as big as possible, then the answer is no because Asana and other people have built multi-billion dollar companies.\n\n(00:29:28):\nIf the goal is the founder has an incredible life, probably has three houses, flies all over the place, does whatever he wants, has recurring revenue and he gets to work with headphones on building beautiful piece of software that people love, then I think he's won. I am generally much more in the camp of the Things guy has won, not Dustin Moskovitz. Dustin Moskovitz is just playing a different game than the Things guy. And if Dustin Moskovitz was running Things, he'd be miserable and if the Things guy was running Asana, he would probably kill himself because he wants to put his headphones on and build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:05):\nI wonder why nobody has come. It feels like just with lifestyle businesses, if it's working and you would think somebody would come in with more money and more funding and just eat their lunch, is the key that the market is too small for a VC to ever be excited and so that's why no one's coming for them?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:30:21):\nI think so. I mean, I think Things probably, I'm just guessing, I don't know any of the numbers or whatever, but I would assume it makes between five and $25 million of revenue, which to a VC is not even worth considering a VC. For a VC to invest in your business, you need to have a story where it's worth 300 million to a billion dollars or more. So it's just not that exciting to them, which again, going back to fish where the fish are, you don't want to be fighting against the commercial fishermen. If you just want to have a little business where you get enough fish to feed your family and your village or whatever, find the other fishing hole. Don't go where the trawlers are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:04):\nThis is great advice if you're trying to start a non venture backed company is find. This metaphor just keeps working for us, which is fish where the fish are, but not where the professional fishermen are. Also, ideally not where there's just a ton of, I don't know, fishermen from all over the place. I don't know, solopreneur fishermen. Okay. Coming back to just starting a successful company, what would you say are the keys to an amazing business model, an amazing business broadly, what should you be thinking about and looking into? I know you spent a lot of time thinking about this. When you're buying companies, what are a few bullet points that you want to focus on?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:31:38):\nWhat I do for a living is basically buy businesses. So in my early career I started one business, then I started about 10 more, and then I realized starting businesses was extremely hard and I was doing pretty well. I was making quite a bit of money and I'd sold one of my businesses and I was looking out at the next 10 years and really asking myself what do I want my career to be and am I happy doing what I'm doing? And the answer was no. I did not starting businesses and experiencing that failure rate, it was incredibly stressful. And so I picked up a book about investing and I got lucky. The first one I bought was about Warren Buffett, and for those that don't know, Warren Buffett is he's counter to every VC kind of hustle culture thing you might hear because he basically just sits quietly in a room and reads all day, despite owning 260 different businesses and being one of the 10 wealthiest people in the world, his life is incredibly calm.\n\n(00:32:44):\nHe only does what he wants and he spends most of his time quietly reading and once or twice a year, he makes a big decision to buy a business. And so when I read about Warren Buffett, I just thought, wow, I'm a sucker. I'm running around like a crazy person trying to run all these businesses. Why am I not just buying businesses and letting them run? And so when I'm buying a business, what I'm really looking for is something that I can't mess up. Right now, obviously we buy a business, we try not to mess it up, and we're very intentional, actually very odd in that when Tiny buys a company, we generally just leave them alone. If they already have management in place, we say nothing changes, no one should know that we've even bought them. Obviously people know that, but really there should be no change whatsoever.\n\n(00:33:31):\nThe only change that we generally make is if the founder wants to leave the business, then we'll bring in a CEO to run the company, and that's probably the most important decision that we make. So I'm looking for a business though where it is so good that it's hard to mess up, and most businesses are very easy to mess up. One person leaves and the whole business falls apart because it's held together with dental floss and duct tape. And so I'm",

So I'm looking for a business though where it is so good that it's hard to mess up, and most businesses are very easy to mess up. One person leaves and the whole business falls apart because it's held together with dental floss and duct tape. And so I'm really looking for what Warren Buffett would call a moat. So a moat is basically a brand, so that could be a brand like Coca-Cola, Tylenol, Advil, something like that. So something that gives you pricing power where you can consistently charge and you have loyal customers or where we usually find a lot of opportunity is in network effects.\n\n(00:34:23):\nSo typically we're looking for a community that's gotten so big where people don't want to go elsewhere. So for example, we own Letterboxd, which is the largest social network for film lovers. And the question is, if someone else wants to compete with us, why would someone go to their social network that has a small number of users when all their friends are already on Letterboxd? And so you see that same kind of thing with Instagram or Facebook or similar. And so we're looking for businesses like that, something that has staying power that is hard to compete with and that we can hold over the very long term.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:01):\nIt was interesting when Elon bought X, how that was such a test of the power of network effects. If you think about it, back then he changed the name. So the brand completely changed the team. 80% of the people left. What was left, it was the network and the network effect and the simplest way. Just for folks that aren't super familiar with network effects, the way I think about it is just network effect is where every additional user that joins the network becomes more useful for everybody.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:35:27):\nThere's another moat, which is high switching costs, which I don't really like because it's not really very consumer friendly, but an example might be Salesforce where no one wants to, they've spent years and they've done all the implementation and trained everyone on it, and it's kind of the standard, everybody hates it, but ripping it out and switching is such a pain in the that they just won't bother. That's another form of sometimes a great business, but again, that's more depressing. I don't love that one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:56):\nWhat's the last company you guys bought?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:35:58):\nWe bought Serato. Serato is the largest DJ software company in the world. So if you ever see a DJ playing and they've got a laptop in front of them, probably using Serato to DJ.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:09):\nWow, that is super cool. What I'd like a funding to be walking into.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:36:14):\nI used to DJ so I was aware of them and it was one of those moments we talked about earlier where I understood the business. They had a really interesting mode of this huge passionate user base and deep hardware integration. And I also love DJing and I was able to analyze the business and luck comes to the prepared mind and it worked out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:35):\nThis is another great callback to your excellent piece of advice of just ideally what you're working on, whether you're starting the company or buying the company, is you have a unique unfair advantage or some kind of unique background that connects to that idea. Let me ask you one more question before we shift a whole different topic, hint, hint, AI. Something that I know you talk a lot about, something you believe strongly and something you deal with a lot is when you buy companies is just as people and the challenges of management and hiring and people. So what have you learned about just how to successfully, I don't know, find amazing people, keep amazing people, help people be more successful within the companies that you operate?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:37:15):\nMy business partner, Chris, has a really great quote. He says, \"There are no problems. There is only people problems.\" And so we've found that you could tell us that there's a disaster that one of our business units is about to fail or something like that. As long as I'm surrounded by really great smart people, I feel fine. But when we have a bad actor, we have a psycho or a narcissist or a really horrible, difficult person we're dealing with, all bets are off and life becomes incredibly stressful. So I'd say I spend probably 20% of my time just trying to make sure we're filtering people very carefully and ensuring we're working with people that we enjoy. And I could talk about it in the AI, I've done some really interesting stuff to help me screen and identify difficult people, but I've just found that the biggest mistake I made in my early career was I would hire people because I liked them on gut and I would think that I could change them.\n\n(00:38:12):\nSo it's kind of like in romantic relationships, it never works out well. If you get married to someone and you go, \"Okay, well this is going to be a great relationship as long as I can convert them to Christianity or I can change their parents or their personality,\" or whatever it is. And so I've just found that I've never been able to change someone. You can never mentor someone out into being a good employee. And the kind of heuristic I have is if I ever think, should I fire this person even once, I should fire them immediately. It has always",

And the kind of heuristic I have is if I ever think, should I fire this person even once, I should fire them immediately. It has always been a signal, at least for me, that when someone's a superstar, I can't imagine firing them. I think it's impossible, I'd be lost without them.\n\n(00:38:56):\nBut when I repeatedly start going, \"Man, is this person going to work out?\" Almost always within six to 12 months, it doesn't work out. And so I really try and be really direct about stuff like that and just cut when it's not working. So I'd say the lesson really is hire for what you need. Don't hire just for potential, which is counter to what a lot of people say. A lot of people say hire for potential and coach them into being whatever you need. I just haven't found that. I think you need to hire someone who already is fully formed and can do what you need. But again, everyone does it differently.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:31):\nThis is big advice. Powerful advice. Is this true not just for the CEOs of the companies you run? As for folks under lower down the ladder too?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:39:39):\nWell, for CEOs, one of the most interesting things we've observed is, so I'll give you an example. We had a CEO come in and we were interviewing them and in my opinion, the business needed to grow via organic marketing. In his opinion, it was enterprise sales. And so when we're interviewing him, he keeps going back to his experience building with enterprise sales. And there's this great saying, \"To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\" And so for him, he's looking at this business and going enterprise sales, that's the way to grow. I hire him, but I say, \"Look, if we're going to hire you, we need you to do the organic marketing.\" Lo and behold, of course, he goes off and he does the enterprise sales thing. And I've just found that hiring CEOs is like they're an elephant and you're the rider.\n\n(00:40:31):\nThey're going to go wherever it is that they want to go. And so listening incredibly carefully to people's words and their experiences, because generally people will do the thing they tell you. So what I look for when I interview a CEO now, I want to be nodding along. I want to go, that's exactly what I would do or that's way smarter than my idea. And then I just leave them alone because I've found that anytime I try and pull them in a certain direction or coach them or whatever, it just doesn't work. And again, this could be my problem. I might be the world's worst coach and mentor, but for me, that's been what's true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:06):\nI imagine there's also an element of they won't love the job if they want to be doing say enterprise sales, and then they're creating viral TikTok videos all day and tweeting. They're like, \"What the hell?\"\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:41:15):\nWell, I've also found people will shoot themselves in the foot. If I tell them an idea in a board meeting and I say, \"I really need you to try this,\" it never works because usually they sandbag it, right? They don't really put their heart into it or they're just placating me and they don't want it to work. They want their idea to work. And so I've learned not to do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:37):\nThis episode is brought to you by Miro.

    "content": "you're not just the kind of person that just talks about it and tweets pontifications, you're clearly using it in every facet of your job and looking for more ways to use AI. So I have a lot of questions here because I think this is where more and more founders are going to be where you are today. First of all, just what's in your AI stack these days? What are the tools you find yourself coming back to most or finding most useful?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:43:10):\nSo the primary tool I use is a tool called Lindy, Lindy.ai. And what it basically lets you do is build workflows and agents. So it's very simple. You might say, \"When I get an email in the Gmail API, I want to add an AI agent that reads the email and labels it based on that.\" Or you can build a crazy Rube Goldberg machine that sends different emails all sorts of different places. So for example, when I get an email and it's related to my kid's school, one of the big problems I have is that my kid's school sends so many emails, the field trip is on Thursday and you need to bring the following things. And meanwhile, there's parent teacher interviews and all these things get added to my calendar. The AI agent automatically takes that, puts it onto my calendar, makes sure there's notes for all the things I need to prepare and stuff. So I have just basically tried to take every single thing a human could do in my inbox and automate it with Lindy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:10):\nAnd you're sitting there in Lindy doing this yourself or do you have people that you've trained to help build these sorts of things for you?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:44:16):\nNo, I do it myself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:17):\nOkay. How many agents, if that's the term you want to use, do you have running for you roughly?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:44:22):\nOh man, I think I probably have not a crazy amount within... Let's see. Well, each workflow probably has four or five agents. So for example, my inbox has four or five agents, and then I have a whole bunch of other, I've got a calendar agent, I've got a meeting agent, I've got an email agent, I've got a scheduler, I've got a CRM, and basically they're all different workflows. So the whole bunch of agents within.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):\nOkay, and you're not an investor in Lindy, right? You're just a fan, super user.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:44:53):\nNo, no.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:54):\nFun fact. I actually am. So this is great.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:44:56):\nOh, no way. That's awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:57):\nTiny angel investor. So just want to put that out there, which I love that this came up organically. What are a couple other really interesting use cases, workflows you've built that people might be inspired by it?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:45:08):\nLet me go through the email one a little more. So basically emails come in and the first agent says, does Andrew even need to see this? Let's say you're in a thread and you've already chimed in and everyone's just saying, cool, that works. I don't need to see that. So just archives that never. So that immediately reduces my email by about 20%. Then it decides is this something that is time sensitive? Is this something that needs to be dealt with in the next 24 hours? And if so, it labels it in a special 24-hour label. So when I go in my email, one of the biggest stresses I find is I go, \"Shit, there's 200 emails in here, and if I don't go through all of them, I don't know if there's an emergency burning somewhere.\" So now I do. Then it takes any email or every single email and it decides, is this a simple decision?\n\n(00:46:00):\nSo for example, let's say you email me and you say, \"Hey, do you want to get lunch?\" So it emails me privately and it says, \"Hey, Lenny wants to get lunch. Do you want to say yes? Do you want to say yes, but in a few months? Do you want to say no? How do you want to say no?\" And it gives me multiple choice. I just can say four, number four, and then it'll email you as me and it'll write out a nice thoughtful email or whatever. So stuff like that is so freaking cool and helpful. And I'd say that it's replaced stuff that my full-time, I used to have a full-time assistant just working on email that's all completely automated and there's all sorts of other cool stuff I'm doing there. Other agents, I'm working on one right now to manage my calendar, which is really complex. I do a lot of scheduling and a lot of rules. I have another really simple one. It adds emojis to every single calendar event. So when I look at my calendar, I've got beautiful little emojis for every single calendar event. Very silly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:00):\nWhat are the emojis? Do they represent something?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:47:03):\nYeah, so if I write weightlifting, it'll just do a guy weightlifting or whatever. I've got one that, this one's cool. Basically what it does, every time I email someone, it looks them up online, it figures out what city they live in. It checks my CRM and air table. It says, \"Okay, I don't know where do you live.\"\n\nLenny R",

So it'd say, \"Okay, you email Lenny, he lives in Marin.\" It puts in the database you live in Marin. And then next time I travel to the Bay Area, the agent will see two weeks before and it'll say, \"I saw you're going to San Francisco. Here's all the people in San Francisco you should try and have coffee with.\" Right? So just all these things that-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:22):\nI would pay for that.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:47:43):\nYeah, yeah, exactly. All these things that I've dreamed of having my assistant do that my assistant could just never consistently do because she gets distracted, we're doing an event, there's something going on. It's like having the world's most reliable employee who costs $200 a month and works 24/7.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:02):\nOkay, I want to follow that thread, but first of all, what other tools do you have? Lindy's one, what else do you find really useful?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:48:08):\nSo the other one is Replit. So Replit is basically a vibe coding platform. You can literally go into it and say, \"I want to make a website for my sound software business. Here's a big document with a bunch of details,\" and it'll go and design a pretty impressive website. But then you can also build web apps now. So you can literally be like, \"Yeah, build a Python web app that does XYZ,\" and the design is getting so good because it uses Claude 4. You can start saying, \"Do it in the style of Stripe. Think this through, rewrite all the copy and the tone of David Ogilvy or Malcolm Gladwell,\" or whoever you like, and it does a really incredible job. So what I'm finding is that things that previously would've frustrated me because I would've had to rely on a team of five, I can just do entirely on my own when it comes to web projects and stuff like that. So I'm having a blast with that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:07):\nThat's cool. So your team Replit versus Lovable, Bolt, v0, is that roughly right?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:49:12):\nI mean, they're all great. I, just am the most familiar with Replit, and it seems like it has the most functionality. It has a lot of beef to it, whereas Lovable and Bolt seem a little more basic. You might have to deal with deployment and stuff in a fiddlier way with them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:29):\nAwesome. Okay. Anything else?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:49:32):\nAnother one I love, so Limitless. I don't know if you've seen this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:32):\nI've got one of those.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:49:37):\nIt's really cool. So clips to your shirt. I actually just put it on my pocket so no one actually notices that I've got it on usually, and I just have it on all day. And what it does is it just records everything I do. And then I can say, the other day I had a coffee with someone and I'm the kind of person where I go a mile a minute and I say, \"Oh, I'll send you that and I'll do this,\" or whatever. And so at the end of the day, I can just say, \"Hey, what did I promise to people today?\" Or even better, everyone loves this use case, I have a fight with my girlfriend. And she says, \"You didn't say that.\" And I'm able to say, \"Well, actually you did.\" And you can query it as an LLM.\n\n(00:50:16):\nSo you can say you're a couples counselor. Look at this fight. What did each person need? How did it start? What are the key lines? Where did it change? How could you do this better? And so honestly, from a relationship standpoint is probably where it's been the most useful. What's cool too is that has an API. And so eventually, I haven't gotten there yet, but eventually you'll be able to just have it record your entire day and then automatically go into your Todoist or whatever it is, and add to-do's or send emails or whatever you need it to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:48):\nWow, this is so fun. Or just per your point with the relationship, ask it, \"What could I have done better today? Where did the day go downhill?\"\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:50:57):\nYeah, I saw a guy on Twitter. He said, \"Every day I ask it, 'How could I have been a better dad?'\" And it'll be like, \"Oh, your daughter tried to get your attention about this. You should have paid attention,\" or whatever.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:07):\nAnd that was with the Limitless data. Oh, man, I love that. With the relationship, you didn't go where I thought you were going to",

With the relationship, you didn't go where I thought you were going to go, where it's like, \"Oh, but who actually said it? What did you actually say?\" I love that It became much more wholesome of just like how could we have communicated better holistically? Okay. My wife actually is like, \"Don't wear this around.\"\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:51:25):\nYou just got to wear it really covertly. Honestly, I know it sounds kind of cheesy because you think like, \"Oh, it'll tell her,\" right? But in reality, usually you're both guilty in the fight. And my girlfriend has actually appreciated it because there's been half the time it'll be like, \"Oh yeah, Zoe said this and it triggered this,\" but a lot of the time it's me too. And I think I'm totally right. So I find it actually really helpful. Other tools, I mean otherwise, it's the basic stack of Claude and ChatGPT and Gemini. And Gemini I use mostly for things that are really large. So for example, all my medical records, I have trained on Gemini 2.5 just because the other ones can't really go through it all. Claude, I use for writing very extensively. I find it's the best for that.\n\n(00:52:14):\nAnd then ChatGPT for everything else. In terms of cool things I do, recently, I went through my entire medicine cabinet and I just took big photos that showed all the different medicines and stuff. And now I can say something like, \"Hey, I'm really tired and stressed out today. What supplement should I take and what dose?\" Or I'll say, \"Remember all the medications I'm taking, whenever I ask you a health question, always remind me in the context of I might be taking that medication.\" So a few times it's said, \"Hey, you shouldn't take this other medication because your genetics say you're not compatible with it and you're already taking this other one.\" So stuff like that's been really helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:57):\nFor that use case, do you come back to a specific conversation where you've given it that context, use a project or something-\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:53:02):\nNo, I say remember. I just say remember these supplements, this is what I have in my medicine cabinet or this is what I take every day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:10):\nI see. So just tap into the memory of ChatGPT.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:53:12):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:13):\nThis is awesome. This makes me remember that. And this connects to other points you've been making, I've started to use ChatGPT deep research to prep for these conversations. I used to have a researcher who did this for 400 bucks. They did research on every guest that I had, four to 500 bucks, and gave me a whole doc, \"Here's everything about them. Here's their background, here's questions you might want to ask.\" Deep research is better. Just as of recently, especially with o3-pro.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:53:39):\nWe were talking earlier about agents. I forgot one of my favorite agents. So it looks on my calendar 30 minutes before I meet anyone. It goes on to Perplexity and it does a deep dive on the person and it sends me, it goes into my email and it gets the context of the meeting. So often I book meetings three months out. So I usually look at my calendar and I go, \"Who is this person? I don't even remember booking this meeting.\" It'll text me before and it'll say, \"Here's who you are, here's your background, here's the email context of why we're meeting.\" And it basically does all the research for me. So I do the same thing. I also use deep research and say, \"If I'm meeting them, you know everything about me. What are our commonalities and what are all the fun things we should talk about?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:22):\nOh my God, I just want to plug and play all these agents you've built to use them myself. Interestingly, I tried to create an agent to do this research kickoff for me, but I don't think you can automate ChatGPT deep research. Okay.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:54:35):\nOnly Perplexity. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:37):\nOkay. Perplexity is great too, but it's different. Okay. So let me follow this thread I was going down, which is around job displacement. I know you think a lot about this. So with me, this researcher as a contractor I was working with for a few months, I no longer need them. Your assistant, you no longer need. Thoughts on just the impact we're going to see on jobs as a result of AI.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:54:58):\nThere's this great William Gibson quote, \"The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed.\" And I think that we are in the Palm Treo phase. Do you remember the Palm Treo?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:09):\nNo.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:55:10):\nSo when I was, let's see, in 2007 I think, was that when the iPhone came out? 2007?\n\nL",

Do you remember the Palm Treo?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:09):\nNo.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:55:10):\nSo when I was, let's see, in 2007 I think, was that when the iPhone came out? 2007?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:17):\nI know [inaudible 00:55:19].\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:55:18):\nSomething like that. In 2007, there was this device called the Palm Treo and it was like a little PDA with a stylus and it had a little modem attachment. And so what you could do is you could get your email anywhere and that was this shocking thing. It had a black and white or barely color screen and you could go in and email people. And I remember walking through the mall buying shoes while answering business emails and going, \"This is the ultimate freedom. This is incredible.\" But the problem with that device was it sucked. You had to use a stylus, it's not a good user experience. And then the iPhone comes out and you're like, \"Okay, this is what I was waiting for. This is the real thing.\" But I got a little preview with the Palm Treo and so right now people like me who have the time and skillset to nerd out and build the agents can do this. It's just not accessible to everybody.\n\n(00:56:14):\nAnd I think that if it was accessible to everybody in terms of if you could just open ChatGPT and say, \"Hey, ChatGPT, I run a business, can you help me?\" And it started asking you questions and it said, \"Oh well you do sales. Do you want me to set up a sales agent? Okay, great, plug in your HubSpot API, now tell me a few things and then give me access to all your data.\" And then before you know it, it's just a digital employee that's on the other end of the phone on ChatGPT just like in the movie, Her, that you can talk to and it can go do stuff. I think that is kind of the iPhone moment that we're going to have in some time in the next five years. And so I think that if AI doesn't progress, we will see some serious job displacement, like what you already mentioned, the translators, the researchers, the admin, some assistant jobs, depending on the kind of work they do, those jobs will definitely be massively affected.\n\n(00:57:13):\nBut I think pretty quick, all knowledge work jobs could be affected if the models scale in the way that they say they're going to. I mean if you trust Sam Altman and Dario Amodei, I mean Dario Amodei said by, \"2027, our models will be smarter than all PhDs.\" So in any subject. That is a staggering statement. And he's been a very conservative kind of almost fearful voice in the AI world. Very cautious to say things like that. And so when he said that, I perked up and started listening carefully. I don't know that that's how it's going to play out. He might be trying to fundraise, we have to take it with a grain of salt. But if that's true, then I think so many knowledge work jobs are going to change massively.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:09):\nOkay, there's a lot here. I actually had Mike on the podcast, their CPL, Mike Krieger, and he pointed out that Dario, every prediction he's had so far has been right over the past few years. And so there's a reason to listen to his insights. Okay. Andrew, I know you're not going to have all the answers for people. But let me ask you kind of a two-part question for new grads and for people currently in the workforce say like, I don't know, senior product manager advice on what they should do, where should they focus? What skills will matter most? What jobs do you think will last? What advice can you give us?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:58:43):\nEverybody 10 years ago, do you remember there was this whole movement that we should teach kids how to code? Remember that?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:49):\nMh-hmm.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (00:58:51):\nNow teaching kids how to code is teaching kids Basic and we have a GUI, right? You don't need to learn punch cards and basic programming or MS-DOS because we all have keyboards and mice. We don't have to do that. And I feel like coding has really gone away because of that. And I think now people are saying people need to learn how to prompt, which I think is very true for the tool set right now. But I don't know how relevant that is in the future because I think we're still, again, in the Palm Treo phase, I think that the AIs will be very good at eliciting what the actual problem you're trying to solve is and reinterpreting it in a way that it can optimize the query to get the right answer and solve the problem.\n\n(00:59:38):\nAnd so I think the fundamental question is do all jobs just become a single prompt? For example, does a CEO just grow the business while making the customers happy and turning a profit or something like that? And it is able to actually be an omniscient presence that can run a whole company. Now that's a big I'm someone building AI agents. I can barely get it to reliably do calendar entries and that kind of stuff. So I don't think that's totally imminent",

I can barely get it to reliably do calendar entries and that kind of stuff. So I don't think that's totally imminent, but I can certainly see a world where that's coming. And so the question is, what is one to do when that reality is barreling down at you? For people who have resources, I think there's a lot of things they can do in terms of investment, they can invest in the companies that'll benefit from this, companies that have a lot of compute or energy or that sort of thing.\n\n(01:00:29):\nSo that's one thing, but that's not really the question. The question is what do you do if you're a smart 18-year-old or 19-year-old or whatever? In my opinion, I think the best thing to do right now is to get incredibly good with these tools and utilize them to build enough wealth that you can put the money into diversifying into compute and energy. And I do think that while everybody thinks that all jobs will go away in five years and robots will be everywhere, people generally overestimate things in the short term and underestimate them in the long term. So I think there's going to be this long window where robotics is not anywhere near good enough to even do raking leaves and stuff. And I think there's going to be a ton of opportunity for people to just spin up new businesses that never existed before.\n\n(01:01:20):\nI was talking to some friends and we were like, \"What do you do in a world of abundance where everything is really cheap and companies operate almost autonomously?\" I think there's a lot of weird skillsets that we can't imagine right now. For example, just being funny, right? Being funny to hang out with them. Think about OnlyFans, right? Right now, there's this whole idea of OnlyFans where people are paying for comfort and connection, but in a romantic sense. Imagine people did that day to day, they just love hanging out with funny people. So you have a funny guy who you chat with or comes over to your house or whatever it is, I'm making stuff up. Maybe it's a guy who comes to play pickleball with you or something, I don't know. But I can imagine that in this weird world, there's all these weird new jobs.\n\n(01:02:06):\nSo I think my take is things will either be totally fine or they will be terrible and we'll all be dead. And I can't predict which those is there. I don't think it's worth thinking about all of us being dead. And so I think it's really just lean into what are the tools, how do you stay cutting edge? How do you build businesses and wealth in this new world? But I am certainly feeling a little bit like all of our brains could be defunct in the next 10 years. And that's kind of a scary thought.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:36):\nI'm picturing this dystopian world where humans are just going around making jokes.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:02:44):\nWhere does status come from in a world of abundance? Where does status come from? Maybe it is just like being the best at hiking or something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:52):\nWell, let me ask you this because this is where it gets even more real is just with your kids. What are you encouraging them to learn? What are you encouraging them to get good at? Because this is the real problem a lot of people are having right now is what will matter in the future. Obviously we don't know, but what are you encouraging them to focus on?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:03:09):\nWell, I don't know. I mean there's so little, they're five and eight. And so really what I'm focused on is making sure they're socialized and they're polite, very basic. So are they comfortable talking to adults? I often send my son, whenever he wants something at a cafe, I always make him go up, ask nicely, pay himself, all that kind of stuff. But at this point I feel like for the first 10 years of life, you're just trying to make sure that they're not traumatized or rude. And I think it's going to be really interesting when they're 10 plus where they're really aware of this stuff and can start building with these tools. And to be honest, I just don't know. I think I just want them to lean into whatever they're passionate about and go from there. But I have no idea. And to be honest, it's not something I'm worrying about because it's too hard to worry about. I don't know, it's too multivariate. There's too many ways it can go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:03):\nI feel like a core part of your message is just get good with these tools. There's this classic quote, \"AI won't replace you, it'll be somebody very good using AI is going to replace you,\" at least for a while. And so it feels like a big part of this is just use these things. Before we started recording, we were having a mic issue and I love you just went straight to ChatGPT, \"ChatGPT, how do I connect this mic to reverse side and make it work?\" And I feel like that's just a habit to build is just like go to ChatGPT whenever you have a problem like that. I've been doing that a lot. I was connecting a subwoofer from what wire do I need to buy to connect the subwoofer to the receiver",

I've been doing that a lot. I was connecting a subwoofer from what wire do I need to buy to connect the subwoofer to the receiver?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:04:37):\nWell, the best part about ChatGPT is I used to just get stuck and I have ADHD. So when I got stuck, let's say, what's an example? I was redoing my home IT security. And what will happen is I'll be in the terminal and I'll enter something and then something goes wrong and it just keeps erroring. And then I'm like, \"Well, I'm out.\" I have ADHD, I can't tolerate this. I just lose the thread completely. And ChatGPT allows me to stay on track and go so much further and faster than I ever could before. I love not being artificially stopped in your tracks and being able to continue the flow state as a result.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):\nAnd also I noticed you were using voice mode, which is what I've been using more and more. And I feel like that's something a lot of people sleep on is just the voice mode where you could talk to it and not have to sit there and type your questions. Okay, so let me go in a different direction. You've been spending a lot of time, you wrote a whole book about this, of just your journey from, you call it Barista to Billionaire where you started serving coffee, then you ended up being very successful, then realize that didn't make you happy. You're quite unhappy with lots and lots of money. I think a lot of people hear these stories, they see this stuff, they're like, \"Yeah, okay, I sort of get it.\" But they still do the same sorts of things. They still assume they will be happy once they reach that next goal, that next title, make certain dollar amount. What can you share? What have you learned about just what it actually takes to be happy that you think people are still not really recognizing and still kind of are confused about?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:06:10):\nDo you remember when you're in your early 20s? I remember when I was in my early 20s, I'd always be like, \"I need to move away to Europe. I need to go discover myself.\" And I'd be really anxious and stressed out and in an existential crisis and then I'd fly to Europe to go backpacking or something and I'd still feel anxious and have my existential crisis. It's just now I'm in Europe. And I think the reality is that whatever's in your brain, whatever that anxiety loop is, doesn't go away just because you have a bigger house or more money in the bank account or you're in Bali or wherever it is, that's a chemical reaction happening inside you that relates to your past and your DNA and all that stuff that creates that soup. And for me, I've always been a very anxious person. I've always worried about tomorrow, I rarely enjoy today, I'm always worrying about what could go wrong in health or my businesses or with my family or whatever it is.\n\n(01:07:12):\nAnd so when I started my business, all I thought was I just don't want to work for someone else. If I can just wake up in the morning, do my own thing, make 60K a year, then I'll be happy. So I got that and then it was once I make a million dollars a year and I can buy a house, well, I got that and so on and so on and so on all the way up to at one point being worth over a billion dollars, by the way, should redo the title of the book from Barista to Billionaire, now it's former billionaire because our stock went down, but it didn't change anything. I'm still just as anxious as ever. I remember a month ago, I had this day where I was sitting in the sauna and I was stressing about a bunch of business problems and money things and I stopped myself and I was like, \"Wait a minute.\"\n\n(01:08:04):\n10 years ago I had all the same thoughts and I was stressed out about similar kinds of problems and our revenue was $20 million bucks or $15 million bucks. Now we're at almost 300 million and I'm still stressed about the same things. And the saddest part was as I met more and more wealthier people all the way up to multibillionaires, I realized they were all still comparing themselves to their peers, competing over who has what and tracking stuff and still unhappy that anxiety loop or depression was still in their brain. I remember I had this moment where I met this guy who is a single-digit multibillionaire, and he goes, \"Oh, Jeff Bezos, he's just so fucking rich.\" And I was like, \"Wait, what do you mean you're worth $5 billion? What can he do that you can't?\" And he goes, \"He can buy a super yacht.\" And it's like, \"What?\"\n\n(01:09:09):\nYou can look at that guy and you can say, \"Oh, that's a wacko and all the other stuff.\" But the reality is that we're all just comparing ourselves to our peers, whatever our peers have that we don't feel hard done by. And I remember just thinking like, \"Oh my God, how do I avoid becoming this?\" And that's the scary reality is no matter how lucky you are, I mean we're also fortunate. For me, I live in Canada. I have every opportunity that I ever could have",

I have every opportunity that I ever could have hoped for. And there's people all over the world who have nowhere near what I had growing up. And yet I felt hard done by because in my neighborhood I was the poor kid. I wasn't poor globally. I wasn't even poor based on Canada. But all my friends had big screen TVs and would go to Hawaii and I never got to do any of that stuff. My parents were stressed about money. So I feel hard done by.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:05):\nThere's a phrase of friend's financial advisor once shared, \"The Joneses are doing really well,\" and that's hard to get over. So what changes did you make to just be happier? It's hard to give up money. It's hard to give up more money you could make. It's hard to give up things that money buys, I guess just so what did you change?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:10:28):\nWell, there's a few things. I mean, one was reframing money to some degree to have it be something that wasn't just about feathering my own nest and making it better. So for example, I was talking to a friend who's very wealthy and I was saying all the feelings I described of have all this and yet I don't feel better. And he said, \"Well, what are you working for?\" And I said, \"Well, I guess I'm just working for the numbers to get bigger and have more employees and that's nice. Our businesses do good things in the world and help more people and stuff, but ultimately it's just to pile up cash.\" And he said, \"I've reframed it so that all my money, 90% of my money plus, goes into my philanthropic foundation and then it gets given away to great causes. So when I think about working really hard or losing a deal or an investment going well, the win isn't for me. The win is about doing something good.\"\n\n(01:11:26):\nSo I did that and that definitely helped. I also stopped spending as much money. I found that the more stuff I had, the more houses I had, the more people that directly worked for me to manage all that stuff, the less happy, I was owned by my stuff. And then I work really hard not to have people... I try not to beat people over the head with it. I drive a normal car. I don't bring people to my house until I know them really, really well. I meet them on neutral ground, I meet them in a cafe. I dress like a schmo. I just try not to be a weird out of touch rich person. But the biggest thing, which is a weird answer, is actually medicating myself. So basically all my life I've been really anxious.\n\n(01:12:18):\nAnd in 2020, I remember I was watching a movie with my ex-wife and I was looping on, \"I need to respond to this email. If I don't respond to that email, this person's going to be mad.\" And then I realized that I was watching a movie for the last 20 minutes and I didn't know anything about what was happening in the movie. And then I was going, \"Oh my God, my wife is going to be mad at me. We're going to get in a fight,\" and I'm projecting all this negative stuff. And in that moment I was like, \"Okay, maybe I do need to try an SSRI or something. This is not sustainable.\" And so I went to my doctor and I got prescribed with one, and I remember I was so scared of it that I cut it into 10 pieces. I said, \"I'm just going to take a tiny little piece.\"\n\n(01:13:01):\nAnd it took me six months after that to try any. But I started taking these pieces every day and I just noticed that within about three or four days, it was like someone had turned down the volume on the nasty voice inside of me doing all that. And for the first time in my life I felt relief. No amount of money or success or attention or anything else had done what this little tiny yellow pill could do for my mental state. And so now I've been on an SSRI for four and a half years or something like that. And then I also started medicating my ADHD. And I would say that my brain went from Times Square to a quiet library. And I think a lot of people are scared of that, but ultimately most people are acting out something that's going on inside of them. There's a trauma or something medically going on and that's creating this anxiety, this depression, this feeling and addressing that is so much more important than trying to get praise from the external world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:05):\nWow, it's really powerful. I really am really thankful you're sharing this. The advice most people hear, the general, I don't know, culture is just like, \"No, don't take meds. Don't medicate yourself, I don't know, there's all these downsides, all this risk. The pharma industry is trying to make money.\" I love this other perspective of it. It's actually really effective and actually makes a big difference in your life and it may be the only solution.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:14:29):\nWell, it's funny because if you have a headache, I don't think many people say, \"Oh, don't",

And so when you take an antihistamine or even a Tylenol, you're changing your brain, you're changing the way you think, you're changing everything. And yet for some reason, people are so scared, myself included, of taking an SSRI or similar medication to treat something that is ruining their life. Anxiety was ruining my life. Every minute of every day I was convinced that something terrible was about to happen. And even now medicated, I still have that voice. It's not like that frankly beneficial voice that helps you grow your business or whatever becomes unproductive at a certain point. And I think that it is wonderful to be able to actually just get a little bit of solace from it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:38):\nWell, for folks that, I mentioned many folks listening, are like, \"Oh man, I should really explore this,\" what's the best way to explore is to talk to your primary care physician?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:15:47):\nYeah. I think talking to your doctor, and one note I think a lot of people miss is when I was so scared of side effects because you hear about all these horrific side effects of people lose their libido and feel terrible and stuff. And so I looked into it and a lot of the side effects are due to the way that people metabolize different drugs. And so you can actually do your 23andMe or similar DNA test and you can find out how you metabolize different SSRIs. And then I chose one that I could metabolize well. And so I've had no side effects or problems. And I know every time I mention this, I get a lot of people that say exactly what you say, big pharma and all this other stuff. But I just ask everyone listening, if you take a Tylenol or you take an antihistamine or other medications, I don't know why something that can be so profoundly helpful is something that people need to be afraid of.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:40):\nAmazing. Andrew, we've covered so much ground. I love the spectrum of topics we've gone after. Is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything you wanted to double down on? Any last nugget you want to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:16:56):\nOne thing that was shocking for me was I was doing... My doctor asked me to get a cognitive test, not because I had any problem, but he said, \"Look, it's really important to get a baseline in your 30s because then as you age, we can make sure that you're not getting Alzheimer's or dementia or whatever.\" So I go and I do this test with a neurologist and she asked me a bunch of questions. It's, \"Remember these 10 digits and say them backwards and all this stuff.\" And finally when I get my test results back, she said, \"Look, your crystallized intelligence, your ability to remember stuff, long range is totally fine. You're above average. Your short-term memory, your working memory is 10th percentile, very, very bad. And you probably should get checked for ADHD.\"\n\n(01:17:47):\nAnd I was like, \"Nope. There's no way. I don't have ADHD. I'm organized. I've got to-do lists. I built a business. I wasn't the hyper kid in school or anything like that.\" And she said, \"Well, look, just humor me. Just go get tested.\" And so I went through this crazy process. You can go online and just quickly get tested or whatever. But I went through this really, really five-day process to get tested. And it turned out that I do have it. And it's really interesting because if you take the normal population of about 5% of people have ADHD, but about 30% of entrepreneurs have ADHD. And many entrepreneurs I talk to, they love new things. They love jumping around between a million different topics. They're an inch deep and a mile wide like I described. And they describe themselves as unemployable. And frankly, I remember I was so skeptical of ADHD that when my girlfriend told me, a friend of hers got diagnosed with it, I sarcastically said, \"Oh good, she better take some meth,\" talking about stimulant drugs.\n\n(01:18:54):\nPreviously I was very, very skeptical of ADHD, but it is a real brain disorder if you actually dig into it. It's a very real thing, very objective that people have poor executive function. And for me, it's given me a lot more empathy for myself and my behaviors because at work, if you have ADHD, you can delegate to other people and build systems to get around your disability. But at home, that's where it really plays out. And so for me, it's like my girlfriend asked me to take the garbage out, and I say, \"Of course.\" And then I forget three times in a row. And she views that as you are being",

And she views that as you are being very hurtful and you're not caring for me. And it causes all sorts of different problems at home.\n\n(01:19:37):\nAnd so for me, not only did it make my work life better because I was more focused, but it actually really helped me in my personal life and it made me feel not broken. I always felt a bit broken. I couldn't put my finger on why, but I just went, \"I'm not good at doing all the things everyone else seems to be able to do no problem.\" And so I think especially because you have an entrepreneur audience, I think a lot of entrepreneurs should consider getting checked for ADHD. Just go and ChatGPT say, \"Ask me a of questions and tell me if you think I might have it.\" But I was very surprised, and that's been really impactful for me too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:13):\nMan, this garbage story is very descriptive of my life, and so I'm going to do this. There's this implication that it's good to know this, right? It feels scary to feel like, \"Oh, shit I might get diagnosed with ADHD.\" Your advice I imagine is it's better to know because you could do stuff about it.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:20:33):\nTotally. I think it's like any medical thing, right? It's like there's an Alzheimer's gene, right? And if you know you have it, there's a lot you can do to slow the disease or prevent maybe getting it or whatever. It's always better to know. Even if you don't medicate, I think there's a lot of lifestyle interventions, dietary interventions, and just things you can do to make your life easier, even if it's just explaining to your partner, \"Hey, I need things to be explained to me this way so that I can be effective in loving you.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:05):\nBeautiful. Okay. Well, Andrew, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:21:11):\nLet's go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:12):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:21:17):\nIf I could only recommend two, I would recommend The Laws of Human Nature by Robert Greene. It's basically like a compendium of every single type of personality disorder or psychological effect. How do people work their minds to make bad decisions? What is a narcissist? What is a psychopath? All that kind of stuff. And Robert Greene does such a great job of telling all that in a really engaging way by using storytelling. So every single chapter has a story about someone with that personality disorder. So I love that book.\n\n(01:21:48):\nThe other one that I love is a book by Felix Dennis called How to Get Rich. It's hilarious because the whole book starts out saying, \"I got rich and I regret it, and I wish that I'd become a poet.\" And instead he went off and he built this huge publishing empire, became a poet in his sixties, and then he died of throat cancer. So it's his story, he basically says, \"I'll tell you how to build the business even though you probably shouldn't.\" And I read that when I was in my 20s, and I found it so exciting and inspiring, and then I recently reread it and I was like, \"Oh my God, why didn't I listen to this guy?\" Everything he said came true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:23):\nNext question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you have really enjoyed?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:22:27):\nI love Challengers. I don't know if you've seen it, but it's amazingly acted, amazing cinematography. It's like this amazing romantic triad tennis movie. Really, really good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:40):\nDo you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love? You already mentioned Limitless. Is there anything else?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:22:45):\nI'm one of those people who really believes in the idea of a robot vacuum. I've probably spent $10,000 on different robot vacuums over the years, probably five or six of them. And I finally got one that actually works. It's called the Matic Vacuum, M-A-T-I-C. And basically, I think it's like former Google Engineers basically built like a mini Waymo car. So it has machine vision and it will avoid absolutely everything and never get tangled, and it can mop your floors and vacuum. I've been super impressed with it so far.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:16):\nI've got one of these myself. Completely agree. My wife loves it, which I did not expect. She's like, \"Turn that Matic on.\" It's very delightful. It has his little personality and it just does a really good job. And I'm not an investor, and that's awesome. I'm a huge fan. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:23:38):\nYeah. My favorite is a quote by Jerzy Gregorek",

Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:23:38):\nYeah. My favorite is a quote by Jerzy Gregorek. It's, \"Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life.\" And I often find that anytime that I'm making the easy choice, my life gets hard. And when I make the hard choice to shut down the business, fire the person, say bye to a project that I was excited about, it's almost always the right choice and it makes my life a lot easier.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:07):\nFinal question. Okay, so let me know if this is true. I found that when you were a teenager, when you're running Macteens, you interviewed Steve Jobs at a conference. Is that true?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:24:18):\nSo when I was a teenager, I had a tech news website and I emailed the Apple PR people and I said, \"Hey, could I interview Steve Jobs?\" And they kind of laughed at me. They're like, \"Yeah, there's no way. You're not going to interview Steve Jobs, but hey, why don't you go to this tour of the Apple Store?\" So this is no other Apple Store has existed. This is in New York at Macworld back in 2004, no, 2003, something like that. And so I was really excited about that. So I show up to go do this tour and there's 30 other journalists there, and I'm first in line, and this big black SUV pulls up and this man gets out and the man is wearing gray New Balance, little circular John Lennon glasses, the mock turtleneck. And my brain finally puts it together and I realize it's Steve Jobs.\n\n(01:25:11):\nAnd he walks directly up to me because I'm first in line and he shakes my hand and he says, \"Hi, I'm Steve.\" And I'm like a quivering mess. I'm 17 years old. He is my hero. He's my Jesus. And so I was just so high on adrenaline that I just started asking him questions. As soon as we walked in, I basically just stayed at his side, and I just picked his brain about all sorts of different stuff. So it's not like I got to ask him questions about life. I was asking him about the new 17-inch iMac or whatever. But it was a pretty cool experience to get to meet him.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:46):\nThat is awesome. There's such a funny thread recently with guests. Everyone, there's like a Steve Jobs connection for the past couple months of guests. That's an awesome story. It just shows that it wasn't luck. You made this happen. You got there first in line.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:25:59):\nThe lesson for me was ask big and maybe you'll get something great. Ask for amazing, you'll get something great, which I did.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:07):\nYes, door in the face technique, I think people call it.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:26:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:12):\nAndrew, this was incredible. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out? I know you're buying companies, investing in companies. Just talk about what you're looking for there in case people are like, \"Oh, this is me.\" And then finally, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:26:26):\nYeah, my business is Tiny, T-I-N-Y.com, and we buy businesses. Basically, when we sold the business, we hated it. We went through this process where we talked to all these douchebags that ran private equity firms that would show up in our office in suits and use a bunch of words we didn't understand. And we ended up going, \"Man, why can't we just sell to somebody who's like us?\" And so we basically started Tiny to become the buyer we wish we could have sold to. And we're looking for businesses that have some of the qualities I mentioned before. So really high quality businesses that do something positive in the world and have happy customers, happy employees, and some kind of competitive advantage that will make them continue into the future. So we own AeroPress, Letterboxd, Dribble, which is a design social network, whole bunch of businesses like that. So if somebody is thinking about selling their business, definitely get in touch.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:29):\nAmazing. Okay. And then how can listeners be useful to you if it's not just that?\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:27:33):\nI just would say if there's anyone really interesting coming to Victoria, Canada, which is where I live, send me an email and would love to have coffee with you. The reason I love going on podcasts is because I get to meet so many interesting people, both randomly. If I'm in a cafe and someone sees me and says hi, I often make a lot of friends that way, or if someone comes to my hometown. So yeah, just get in touch.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:56):\nAmazing. Andrew, thank you so much for being here.\n\nAndrew Wilkinson (01:27:59):\nYeah, thanks, dude. That was fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:00):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:28:03):\nThank",

So you have a problem, a pain, I have a solution, a treatment, and I'm going to tell you why it's better than all the other treatments. And the structure that I read about in these movies was different. Every movie starts with some kind of shift in the world, and I call this shift the shift from the old game to a new game. The archetypal example of this, I think in the business world, is what Benioff did with Salesforce. So he comes in and he says, \"Hey, software is over and there's this new world called the cloud, a new game, new rules. That's the new way to win. And we're going to help you if you're in there.\" This structure really is about defining a movement, and that's very different from, \"Hey, I'm going to solve your problem.\"\n\nLenny (00:00:54):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Andy Raskin. Andy helps CEOs and company leaders align their teams around something he calls a strategic narrative, which as you'll learn all about in this episode, is essentially a simple story that helps people understand why they need your product. And with that helps you align your sales, marketing, and product teams along with your fundraising and even your hiring efforts.\n\nLenny (00:01:25):\nAndy has worked closely with some of the most successful founders and companies out there, including companies like Gong, Dropbox, Uber, Salesforce, Square, IBM, and many others. In our conversation, Andy explains why most people are pitching their product completely wrong, why focusing on the problem you're solving for people is no longer an effective pitch and how the strategic narrative helps you frame your solution in a much more effective way. Andy also shares a ton of examples of the framework in action, why focusing on categories and category creation is so limiting, signs your narrative needs to work and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Andy Raskin after a short word from our sponsors.\n\nLenny (00:02:07):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together, and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing a roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.\n\nLenny (00:02:45):\nIf your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups.

So great to talk with you.\n\nLenny (00:04:21):\nYou are quite known as someone that helps CEOs optimize their pitch, their story, their strategy, which we're going to get deep into. But before we do that, can you just give us a little glimpse into how you found your way into this line of work?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:04:35):\nI started as a coder. I was a computer science major, undergrad, a friend and I had an idea for an app. So this was like during the dot com years. So Windows app, and we coded a little prototype and we started, we put it out there, we started getting some users and we thought, \"Oh, okay, maybe we can get some investments.\" So of the two of us, I spoke English fluently. So we decided, okay, I'll write the investor pitch. So I wrote the pitch, we sent it out and the reaction was really bad. One VC wrote back and said, \"Listen, I rate every plan I get on a scale of 1 to",

One VC wrote back and said, \"Listen, I rate every plan I get on a scale of 1 to 10, and yours is a 1,\" and the next to the one he wrote in parentheses, \"Worst,\" in case we thought maybe that was the top of his rating scale.\n\nLenny (00:05:20):\nBrutal.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:05:22):\nYeah, brutal. But then lower down, so this was back when they would like you'd print, send the hard copy of the plan and they might mail it back with comments written in. And he had written in, \"Not a compelling story.\" A few weeks later, I'm walking by this Barnes & Noble and there's a sign in the window that says, \"For anyone who wants to tell a compelling story,\" okay, that's me. And there's an arrow that points to these books and they turned out to be screenwriting books. I didn't know anything about this, so I started reading these books and it strikes me a movie is a pitch. What is Star Wars a pitch for? It's a pitch for be good, care about people, trust The Force in their terms. But I don't have couple hours. I'm pitching a business. It's very different. I'm not writing a three X screenplay.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:06:11):\nSo what applies, what doesn't apply? I mean these are questions I think I'm still asking, but I did my best to take some of the learnings of how the movie was structured. It was very different from how my pitch was structured and kind of restructure it. And we did that and we sent the pitch out and we start getting more interest. It was really clear. And then we had a term sheet I think a few months later and I'm like, \"What is this story thing?\" That we didn't change the product, it was basically the same business just sort of how we talked about it. That was really interesting to me.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:06:49):\nI mean, over the next 10, 15 years, I thought about, \"Hey, maybe I could do consulting with this.\" CEOs who heard about this were asking me about it. But I still was like, \"No. No CEO's going to budget a line item for the story. That's not a thing.\" So I just didn't do it for a really long time until eventually I was proven wrong about that.\n\nLenny (00:07:13):\nAnd how many years ago was this at this point?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:07:15):\nSo this was dot com. This was like '98 when I was pitching that company.\n\nLenny (00:07:20):\nAmazing. I think there's a couple interesting tidbits about this. One is that interesting opportunities arise when you're doing something you're excited about. So you had the startup, it didn't work out, but you had a problem that you solved for yourself and that led to another, a bigger opportunity for your career.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:07:34):\nYeah, totally.\n\nLenny (00:07:35):\nSo that's interesting. And then also just some of the best opportunities arise from solving your own problem, not planning to start something with it, but just like, \"I have a problem.\" Turns out [inaudible 00:07:44]-\n\nAndy Raskin (00:07:44):\nYeah, I think that's same with you. Right, Lenny? You started writing about stuff and boom, that became the thing.\n\nLenny (00:07:49):\nAbsolutely. It was not quite boom, but eventually it became boom.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:07:53):\nFeels like boom from outside.\n\nLenny (00:07:55):\nYeah, that's how it goes. It always overnight for everyone else that isn't here.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:08:01):\nRight, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:08:03):\nYeah. Okay, so let's get into it. So you help CEOs at this point come up with what you call a strategic narrative and you help them not only come up with this strategic narrative, but you help their teams align around this strategic narrative. So let's just start with what is a strategic narrative?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:08:19):\nYeah, you'd think, I've been doing this for 10 years, I'd have a very snappy definition of it there, and I don't know if I'm really happy with ... like I've ever found one that totally gets at it yet. The one thing I say is it's this one story that the CEO uses to drive success in marketing, sales, but also product. That it becomes like a north star, strategic north star for product roadmap, for fundraising, for recruiting, really everything.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:08:54):\nWhat I think is really interesting as a kind of qualifier is that this story has a certain structure. Like I said, when I found those screenwriting books, I sort of shifted the structure. And the traditional structure, the way I learned how to pitch in business school, I think the way most people did is what I call the arrogant doctor. So you have a problem, a pain, I have a solution, a treatment, and I'm going to tell you why it's better than all the other treatment.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:09:24):\nNot to say it's not",

Let me tell you why it's so great. And the structure that I read about in these movies was different. In the movies, every movie starts with some kind of shift in the world, in the character's world. And I call this shift the shift from the old game to the new game. And the archetypal example of this, I think in the business world is what Benioff did with Salesforce. So he comes in and he says, \"Hey, software is over,\" meaning software in the sense that we're going to own it and maintain it, \"And there's this new world called the cloud, a new game, like the new rules, everything has changed and that's the new way to win. And we're going to help you if you're in there.\" This structure really is about defining a movement and that's very different from, \"Hey, I'm going to solve your problem.\"\n\nLenny (00:10:34):\nI think the Salesforce example is an awesome example of your approach. If they were thinking about it in the old way, what would Salesforce have done? How would they have pitched it if not for, \"Everyone's moving to the cloud, your dumb for using desktop software,\"?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:10:48):\nWell, I think they would've just come out and said like, \"Oh hey ...\" I mean CRM by the way, was already a category. I mean, already Siebel was the huge giant of that space. There were already even companies doing it online, doing it through the web. And so they would've come and said, \"Oh, we're easier to install, faster to get up and running than Siebel,\" or, \"We have this much functionality compared to,\" I think it was, was it NetSuite? Or, I don't know. It was some early Salesforce-like thing that was out there. They would've done these sort of comparison things.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:11:25):\nAnd Benioff, I mean he is a pretty proud guy. I think he did still say like, \"Hey, we're the number one CRM,\" but wasn't what they led with. They led with this story about this fundamental paradigm shift and, are you in or are you not in? And what they did was instead of just saying, \"Hey, we're better than,\" they said, \"Hey, all those others, those Siebel's, they're part of that old game. You want to play that software game? Be my guest, go buy Siebel,\" and of course we know how it played out.\n\nLenny (00:12:02):\nSo the crux of the approach is instead of, \"Problem, solution, you should go do this,\" it's, \"The world is changing, here's where it's going and we're going to help you get there.\" I want go in a little more depth of the framework. But before that, what are some other examples to give people a sense of like, oh, I see, I understand what this might be.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:12:19):\nYeah, so another great example and no coincidence, so is Zuora. So Zuora is the company I wrote about in this post called The Greatest Sales Deck I've Ever Seen, the CEO of Zuora, Tien Tzuo, was employee number 11 at Salesforce. So he learns this from Benioff. And he's pitching, \"Hey, in the old world, businesses operated on transactions. You sold things to people outright. In this new world,\" he calls it the subscription economy, where people want the benefits of those things without necessarily having to pay for them. And of course gives all these examples of all the winners in this, look at all the winning companies. They're all basically going to this new model.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:13:05):\nAnd so he's pitching someone like Ford and you can imagine they're going to Ford and pitching a subscription for car service, which is quite different from just a lease. And they're starting out with this. This is the big shift. Another one, team I worked with early on, and I think they'd agree their story came out of this work was Gong. So Gong everyone probably knows by now, they take the video recordings of all your sales calls and they stick AI onto it and come out with all these insights. And that story is, hey, goodbye opinions. Used to be a world where sales is run on opinions. Hello reality, that now all the winners are adopting this new mindset where we really have to see what's really going on.\n\nLenny (00:13:56):\nIn the Gong example, let's say, what would they have done if they were going, \"Here's the problem, here's the solution, here's what we're going to do for you,\"?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:14:03):\nYeah, I mean that's kind of what they were doing when they started out. And I'm not saying that didn't work totally. I mean already by the time they started doing this, they were starting to become a big company. I remember Bendov said to me, \"Listen, Andy,\" they were around series B, I think this is around 2018. It's like, \"We're going to be a huge company. The question is",

I mean already by the time they started doing this, they were starting to become a big company. I remember Bendov said to me, \"Listen, Andy,\" they were around series B, I think this is around 2018. It's like, \"We're going to be a huge company. The question is how huge. And I think that this narrative along the lines of Zuora or Salesforce, if we get this right, this is going to be a multiplier on our growth.\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:14:38):\nSo I don't remember exactly the pitch beforehand, but it was very much like, \"Hey, we're going to record your calls. We're going to get insights from them. They're better than the insights you could get from Salesforce.\" There wasn't this kind of unifying kind of movement ideology that put it all in context. And what was really interesting was one thing, I don't think they'd be upset if I shared, and maybe it's known. Initially, they were seen as a tool for sales operations, for someone who's going to record the calls and what this narrative did for them. And I think it was already starting to happen, but what it really coalesced was this is a tool for sales leadership.\n\nLenny (00:15:23):\nYou talked about Zuora in the post you wrote, and I imagine many people listening are like, \"Oh, shit. This is the guy that wrote that post that everyone's always sharing with me about how to make a deck.\" And I wanted to ask, how impactful was that one piece of writing for you in your career, just like as a tangent?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:15:39):\nI had written some other posts on Medium in particular. Medium has changed quite a bit, but back then I found that I could write stuff there and get really a lot of people who were interested in what I was interested would sort of come in and create some noise about it. So I was already doing this kind of work for a couple of years, but that post immediately got something like 2 million views around the world and I started getting inquiries from teams all over the world.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:16:12):\nAnd it was I think what really allowed me to say no, okay, I could do this work. That CEO's would budget a line item for this. Because I think if you really understand that post, it's not really about a sales deck, it's really about this story that Tien, the CEO is telling everywhere and that is showing up in the sales deck and structuring it that way.\n\nLenny (00:16:40):\nI think it's just another example that comes up a bunch on this podcast is just the power of writing and the power of content. Yeah, and you're shaking your head.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:16:48):\nTotally. I mean, I had a little mini career as a journalist, as a freelance writer and I really loved that. I actually, I took a class in New York called How to Write a Magazine Article, because I was sort of mid-career, I was curious. And the class wound up being more about how to sell a magazine article. And I found I really loved that, pitching articles, but one thing that was always a downer for me was there's always this editor sort of deciding what's going to be out there.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:17:23):\nAnd when you work with a great editor, it's great, they make yourself better and they're priceless. But still there's this intermediary. What started to happen, I think around when I started writing around 2013, '14, you start to see these platforms, like Medium, even LinkedIn where you can just write and have this audience and I think no way I could do this, the work I do if that development hadn't happened first.\n\nLenny (00:17:53):\nI'm taking us off track, but I want to go a little deeper with this. I find that there's kind of two paths to writing online. One is your path where you write one piece that just blows up like crazy. The other path is more my path where I just write consistently for a long time, and both work and most people try to go your path and they never succeed. It's really hard to make something gets 2 million views, but you can go that path.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:18:14):\nThis is like you said earlier, hey, it seems like boom, but really it didn't. So that was probably the 30th or 40th piece and they were gradually getting more and more traction. There was one I wrote before that about, it's kind of dissecting Elon Musk's pitch for the Powerwall, the battery that they sell. And that one got maybe few hundred thousand views and also was a big jump. And then the next one got some poultry number. So what I find is like, yeah, there's this a while where you're writing and it feels like you're talking to nobody and then gradually it grows and you'll have these peaks, but then over time is where the magic is.\n\nLenny (00:19:03):\nOkay, I'm really glad you pointed that out, that it rarely is just you write one thing and it's boom.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:19:08):\nI'll also say, sorry, because I worked in a magazine, I haven't done a newsletter because that idea of having a deadline all the time and constantly having to, we used to call the magazine Feed the Beast, I feel so free not to have that. So for now at least I haven't done that.\n\nLenny (00:19",

So for now at least I haven't done that.\n\nLenny (00:19:27):\nI know that well, so let me take us back on track and let's talk about just the high level framework here. So you talked about, it starts with this idea of tell people worlds changing, join this movement. What's the simple way to think about this, the pieces of this strategic narrative framework?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:19:42):\nA lot of times people will contact me, say, \"Hey, I tried it, didn't work.\" Well, one very common thing, at least earlier was they would basically just take the Zuora deck, they'd get ahold of it and just put their logo on it. And so that's not going to work. One thing is we're not just saying, \"Hey, the world is changing.\" And then sometimes I'll see, \"The world is changing,\" and there'll be, \"Used to be,\" and there's a long list of things and then, \"Now it is,\" a long list of bullet points.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:20:11):\nWhat's really, I think key is naming it, naming that old game. The examples you saw, software, cloud, transactions, subscription opinions, reality. This very, very concise naming is really key. And it's hard because in making it compact you're losing completeness. So you can imagine you're in a meeting, someone says like, \"Hey, how about we do transactions to subscriptions?\" And someone says, \"Well I don't know, there's a lot of things I don't really subscribe to. Subscription economy, really?\" So we're always kind of overstating it in a way, but it's not a problem. I don't think people say like, \"Oh that's wrong, subscription economy, because I still go to the grocery store and buy things.\" So anyway, that's the first piece.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:20:59):\nThe second piece is what I call naming the stakes. And there's a few ways to do this, but one that's really great if we can do it is to name the winners to show that winners are already playing this new game. So for instance with Zuora they're saying, \"Hey, look, look at all the new winners,\" this is like 2015 so, \"Airbnb, Box,\" all these companies, they're already doing this subscription thing.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:21:28):\nAnd by the way, overall they show this scary stat about the longevity of Fortune 500 companies. It's getting smaller, and so it's a little disingenuous, but basically they make this case that, \"Hey, companies are dying, the ones that are winning are doing this.\" And so to the extent we want to make this life and death just like a movie. This is again, I'll make the parallel to Star Wars. So Luke, he spends the first 15 minutes of the movie belly aching. He wants to be a pilot, he wants to go out and have adventures in space. So Obiwan comes, he says, \"Hey, we got this mission, this princess we got to go,\" and all this stuff, \"Let's go. I'll teach you to be a pilot. We'll go have adventures in space.\" What does Luke say? He says, \"Ooh, you know what, I can't really get involved. They got to go home. It's late.\" Who does this sound like? The reluctant buyer.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:22:27):\nSo yeah, \"I want to be innovative and all this. Ooh, you know what? I don't have budget this quarter.\" So how does George Lucas change Luke's mind? He basically kills the aunt and uncle, sorry, spoilers, it's been 40 years though. If you haven't seen it, you're probably not going to see it. Kills the aunt and uncle. Now it's pretty clear they're coming for Luke. Now the stakes are life and death. Probably he's going to be dead. But there is this other path that Obiwan holds out for him.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:22:55):\nAnd whenever I work with teams and I talk about this, so they're like, \"Okay, I guess we got to then for kill the prospect's aunt and uncle,\" and basically yes, I mean figuratively. We got to show them that the future is not going to just be sort of okay. People talk about making it emotional and I've always wondered, what does that mean? Literally, what is the definition? This is for me the definition, is that the prospect doesn't see the future as sort of okay. They see it as split between a very negative outcome and a potentially very positive outcome.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:23:29):\nThe third piece is what I call naming the object of the new game. I used to call it the promised land message, but I've changed it to this because I've found that it's sort of a little more fruitful. This subscription economy, transactions, it can get a little highfalutin and sort of big, but on the website when we just have to boil it down to a couple of words that's going to be clear right away, what can we say? And I find that what's the object of the new game really boils it down as kind of the rallying cry of the movement. So the example with Zuora, the object for a while was turn customers into subscribers. Very simple. It just sort",

And I find that what's the object of the new game really boils it down as kind of the rallying cry of the movement. So the example with Zuora, the object for a while was turn customers into subscribers. Very simple. It just sort of flows from it. Airbnb for a while had this one, live anywhere. If you think about-\n\nLenny (00:24:21):\nBelong anywhere.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:24:23):\nWell actually it was-\n\nLenny (00:24:24):\nOh, live like a human.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:24:25):\nSo you're right, it was, \"Belong anywhere,\" and then it switched to, \"Live there.\" I may have the chronology wrong, but it was the two of those things. You know better than I do. But either one, I mean think they're saying very similar things. Hey, there's this new world where you don't have to live in hotels, you can stay in people's houses. What's the object of that game is to belong anywhere, but live there. And I love it when it works that way where it's almost like an asymptotically unachievable thing. You are never literally going to live there. And if you think about it, this buyer mission statement, this rallying cry, I think of it really as the mission of the company. I mean, what is the mission of Airbnb other than to help people live there if they're going to be customer focused and all that?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:25:17):\nThe fourth piece is, okay, well this object of the game, winning this game, it better be hard because if it's not, why would we even exist? Just with the movie, if Luke can just go destroy the Death Star then no movie. So there's got to be sort of obstacles in the way, things that are preventing them from. So saying, \"Okay, you want to turn customers into subscribers.\" So whereas Zuora, where they go next is to say, \"Okay, well how are you going to measure lifetime value?\" Because now you have this always on thing. \"How are you going to measure preferences and how they're changing over?\" All these new kind of challenges that didn't exist before. And then these are like the monsters in Lord of the Rings or the Empire in Star Wars, these are the obstacles.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:26:11):\nI think about them because they sound like problems. This is what people would normally say, \"Oh, these are the problems we solve.\" But by setting up this story thing first we've repackaged them as obstacles to a new goal state that we've already positioned as life and death. So they take on this much more emotional meaning. We understand why they matter. And then of course the last piece is now talking about, well, how are we going to overcome these obstacles? Narrative people, in the movie business they call these the magic gifts that the main character gets to go help them win. What are the ways? Now we can talk about that and success stories and all the rest of the stuff.\n\nLenny (00:26:58):\nThere's some obvious parallels to the hero's journey here. I imagine that it was a source of inspiration, and the Star Wars I think is the epitome of that journey. Can you talk about just how related those two are, how you think about that?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:27:09):\nYeah, I mean so hero's journey is this book that comes from, I think it's Hero of A Thousand Faces is a book by Joseph Campbell, a sociologist. He looks at myths over different cultures and different times and he finds this kind of common structure that he calls the hero's journey. I mean it's some controversy about that, about his book. Is it a very male oriented sort of take on things and a bunch of things.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:27:38):\nBut even that aside, I found when I would talk about hero's journey and stuff, it's just like, it didn't really tell me what to do. Yeah, okay, yeah I got to do this pitch. So in the hero's journey there's like refusal of the call. That's actually that thing where Luke says he doesn't want to go and where the buyer says, \"Hey, I don't have budget.\" But I don't know, it was just too theoretical for me to really ... when I use it, people seem to sort of glass over. So I just don't really talk about that at all. But yeah, I mean that's behind a lot of this stuff for sure.\n\nLenny (00:28:17):\nYeah, that makes sense because I think if people hear about that all the time when they're like, become a better storyteller, tell your story in this hero's journey, and it's like, \"I don't know what I'm doing.\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:28:25):\nAlso, I would say there's storytelling as a skill kind of thing, which is a great thing. Learn how to tell stories better, blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm not really interested in that in my work, what I'm interested in is the one story and the structure of that one story. And this one story, it doesn't really have ... like, the world is moved from transactions to subscriptions. There's not a main character in that story who's like having a problem and getting saved. It's almost as if what's happening is we're turning the person we talk to into the main character. By spelling out the shift, we're changing their world and we're saying, \"Hey",

I love that.\n\nLenny (00:29:18):\nLet me just try to summarize what you shared, this five step framework. So you start with here's a new movement that's happening and you want to name it, you want to name the stakes and there's winners and losers and here's already happening and it's really important. Then you want to name the object of the new game, like turning customers into subscribers. Then show the obstacles, here's why it's challenging, and then talk about how you're going to overcome these obstacles.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:29:41):\nAnd by the way, the naming of the object of the new game, I find it often is really nice to do it as a question. So we hey, there's this shift from transactions to subscriptions and look, everyone's doing it. So we asked a simple question, what would it take to turn every customer into a subscriber? And this way we're kind of bringing the person we're pitching to almost like they're coming along with us as a co, I don't know, adventurer in crafting this story.\n\nLenny (00:30:17):\nI love that. This episode is brought to you by Eco. Last month Eco users earned an average of $84 in cash back rewards. How? With Eco the future of personal finance. Eco is the update to a misaligned financial system providing an app that works just like your bank but removes almost all of the middlemen, helping even the best money optimizers optimize in less time automatically.\n\nLenny (00:30:40):\nWhat if you earn rewards for paying your rent or got rewarded for ordering food and shopping online or even earn rewards for saving each month? And then imagine if you got rewarded again just for getting rewarded. With Eco, you can spend at some of your favorite merchants and automatically get 5% cash back plus Eco's APY rewards look more like $80, not 80 cents. And then there are Eco points, the world's first open reward system. You earn them whenever you do almost anything in the eco app. Eco is working to make these points the most rewarding points ever so it pays to be early.\n\nLenny (00:31:13):\nSound too good to be true? Go to Eco.com/Lenny, sign up for an onboarding and find out why it isn't. Lenny's podcast listeners who attend an Eco welcome session will get an exclusive 4% APY on deposits over $1,000. Learn more at Eco.com/Lenny, that's E-C-O.com/Lenny. Maybe just to reinforce this even more, what if we go through the five steps and just with one company as an example and just talk about what each of those were for them?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:31:41):\nOkay, great. So there's a company called 360Learning. So this company, I don't know if folks know, but this company is raised over $200 million. They're in the space of corporate training software. So big companies, they have to train their people on all kinds of stuff. So you want to go through that one?\n\nLenny (00:32:01):\nYeah, that sounds great.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:32:03):\nOkay, great. By the way, Nick Hernandez is the CEO and Nick's been on my podcast, so he's talked about this. So they for a long time were pitching themselves as collaborative learning. So they have features that let people sort of collaborate on courses and all kinds of stuff. And Nick is often pitching CEOs, of course his team is as well. And he told me that it was sort of falling a little bit flat. People, collaborative learning, whatever. How are you different from this learning platform, this learning platform?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:32:42):\nAnd so when we worked together this collaborative learning, it's almost like a category name or a descriptor or something. They were so embedded that I decided, I don't even want to take it out, but can we define it in terms of a story? So the story they came to was, hey, used to be that companies train their people through basically a mindset of top-down learning. There's going to be some learning guru at the company, they're going to get all the courses, they're going to put it all together and sort of send out this training material to everybody.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:33:23):\nWhat's happening now is winning companies are approaching this differently. They're adopting this approach we might call upskill from within, which is if you look at Google, there's this page where I think you can go, it's a public. You can connect with Google's AI experts. They literally turn their internal experts into champions that are educating, not even just the company but even external people. They've created this culture of our own people are going to be the educators. So that's the shift from top down to this upskill from within. And of course I just even started to do the second piece which was like, hey, look at the big companies who are doing this.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:34:10):\nAnd then",

And of course I just even started to do the second piece which was like, hey, look at the big companies who are doing this.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:34:10):\nAnd then I think they showed, \"Hey, you're not doing this. Look, training is becoming very expensive. People don't care. So this is the downside. So we're creating these sort of stake ...\" And also I think he has something about how training now, like companies, if you don't adapt, if you can't get these skills to your people, if you're a car company and you can't get these skills around electric cars, you're dead.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:34:35):\nNick was in France and he saw this poster, a recruiting poster from McDonald's and it said, \"Hey, if you work at McDonald's you're going to learn from everybody else on your team.\" And it was like, wow, there it is. So there's another example we used as a kind of winner example. And so then the question became, I can't remember exactly, it was something like, how do you upskill from within? What would it take for you to turn your experts into champions of learning in the company and turn them into stars, and all this?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:35:06):\nAnd then I'm going to forget here what all the obstacles were. But I think it was things like, well, how are you going to make it possible for anybody to create a course? People who might have expertise in electric engines but don't know how to create a course, how are you going to make sure that there's still the learning department, they're going to keep control and can ... all this. You can imagine all the different kind of questions. And then of course now 360Learning starts talking about all that stuff.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:35:36):\nWhat Nick has told me, I'm actually going to be on a webinar with Nick where someone asked me, \"Could you bring in a CEO who could talk about this stuff? Not just you B blabbing on about strategic narrative.\" And so Nick is going to join it. And we had a dress rehearsal the other day and he was telling me it's just like when he starts with this now he doesn't even get the question anymore of well how are you different from this other learning platform? Which used to always be the thing. It's just a much more seamless, okay, yeah, talk to our learning people, get this going. So it's just sounds like it's been really effective for them.\n\nLenny (00:36:13):\nThat's actually was what I was going to ask next is what kind of impact have you seen with someone shifting their pitch story from this doc? What was the arrogant doctor approach to the strategic narrative?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:36:23):\nYeah, I mean it's always this kind of thing I hear. I mean, of course it's very difficult to measure this. I mean, what was the value of the strategic narrative for Gong and its growth? Was it 3X versus 1X, 2X? Or I don't, who knows, right? But the things I hear from CEOs, a few things. One is that when they're pitching, they're not pitching features out of context, they're pitching now a movement which is a lot better place to be, I think. In a way you're not pitching product. Product is like a prop for making the story come true. Very important prop, but there's this higher level overlay that becomes the focus of the conversation, at first, and of course we're going to get into product and that helps sell. Once we have this story then everything in marketing can be all about this story.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:37:21):\nWith Zuora, if you look at their website, well when they first started doing this, maybe 80% of the content is not, \"Hey, let me tell you about how Zuora is so great,\" or, \"Here's our new release,\" or whatever. It's, \"Here's how music companies are embracing subscriptions. Here's how luxury goods companies are embracing subscriptions.\" It's all these kind of almost trend pieces that become unlimited fodder. And again, you're not touting your ... it's less salesy, right?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:37:51):\nAnother thing I just hear always, I just interviewed a CEO this morning for my podcast and this is the first thing he actually said was, \"It becomes the strategic north star for the product.\" So what he was telling me, and this was actually a little unusual, I asked him, \"Why did you come to me at first?\" And of course I'd asked him that before, but he said something this time that was a little different from what I'd heard before. He said, \"We are constantly getting feature requests through sales, through customer success. And we had sort of no way, bar to decide well what do we take on, what don't we take on? And this clearly has become our bar.\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:38:38):\nIf you think about it for 360Learning, does it help us upskill from within? It's in. Does it not? Or it's prioritized. Does it not? Less prioritized. Amit Bendov told me this directly, he said we exactly the same thing. He said, \"We get a lot of requests for features and a lot of them are basically about opinions, some way to record opinions.\"\n\nLenny (00:39:04):\nAnd this is Gong.\n\nAndy Raskin (00",

Drift comes out with essentially like a chatbot for your website, which might be the 30th chatbot for your website. And they don't say, \"Hey, here's why our chatbot is the best one.\" They start from a completely different place, which is, \"Hey, used to be people would sort of wait around for you to get back to them. It was a world of later. They called it the world of forms. You put up a web form and you expect someone's going to fill it out and maybe wait a few days while you take your sweet time deciding if you're going to get back to them.\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:39:58):\nAnd David Cancel and David Gerhardt started from right the beginning saying, \"Now we're in a world of now, where buyers are ...\" I think they showed this woman, I remember it was this woman sleeping with her phone. That's your prospect. They're always on and they're going to expect you to be engaging with them right away. And they called this conversational marketing, and they really went with that and created I think a whole movement and they broke away from all of the other chatbots.\n\nLenny (00:40:35):\nAwesome example. So earlier you threw out this word category, and I've noticed you haven't talked about category and category creation too much, and I think that you're kind of not a fan of this idea of creating a category and focusing on category. I'd love to hear your perspective on how that all relates to the stuff you recommend.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:40:55):\nLenny, are you trying to get me in trouble? Like that guy who guy on your podcast who attacked jobs to be done?\n\nLenny (00:41:02):\nApparently, let's do it. Let's see what kind of trouble we can get into.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:41:06):\nI would soften it a little bit and not just ... because I don't want the ire of the category design folks, but I really would soften and say, I wouldn't say I'm not a fan of creating category. Look, I think if you look at Play Bigger, which has become The Bible of that category creation thing, if you look behind that going to, what do they say the category is? They say it's a narrative. It's a story about how the world was to how it is. And so what I find though is that when people think about category creation, they tend to just focus on, okay, well, what is this category name going to be that we got? What are these three words or two words, whatever, that are going to magically make us seem like we're totally different from everybody else?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:41:52):\nAnd A, I think that's not really possible. These three words aren't going to do it. Take Gong, I mean already other companies were using this term revenue intelligence. With Gong, it suddenly becomes a thing because I think they have this opinions-to-reality story behind it. At one point, again, I asked Amit, he said, \"Yeah,\" because I remember he really struggled, \"What should we call it? What should we call it?\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:42:20):\nHe came up with that one. But then when I asked him later, he is like, \"Yeah, you know what? In hindsight we probably could have called it strawberry intelligence. It didn't matter. It was really the story that sort of mattered.\" I think he was exaggerating a little bit. And I think the category people would actually agree with this, I think they would agree with, hey, these three words are, it's sort of a shorthand for this movement of old game narrative.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:42:48):\nBut I guess I feel like still by calling it category and category name, we're just focusing on those three words so much. And what happens often is CEOs will, they'll kind of come up with this little category, like what happened with Nick at the 360Learning with collaborative learning. We have this name, but we don't know how to tell the story around it. So my feeling is like, well, let's focus on the story. So that's why I talk about strategic narrative and movement creation versus category creation. If someone decides that your movement is a category, great. Bonus.\n\nLenny (00:43:32):\nI see. So essentially your approach is category can play a part of this, but there's a bigger question you have of what's the story, what's the movement, what are the obstacles and categories and element of that potentially?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:43:45):\nI mean, I almost see them as orthogonal, like with HubSpot. HubSpot had this narrative around inbound. It used to be just outbound stuff, now we're going to have inbound. And that wasn't really a",

So essentially your approach is category can play a part of this, but there's a bigger question you have of what's the story, what's the movement, what are the obstacles and categories and element of that potentially?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:43:45):\nI mean, I almost see them as orthogonal, like with HubSpot. HubSpot had this narrative around inbound. It used to be just outbound stuff, now we're going to have inbound. And that wasn't really a category. Back then they were probably known as marketing automation. Now they're probably known as CRM because they've broadened. But this movement is the thing that's sort of the constant and in some ways orthogonal to whatever category they're in.\n\nLenny (00:44:16):\nIs the strategic narrative framework right for essentially any company or is there a sweet spot? And I've noticed most of the companies you've been talking about are B2B SaaS. So I don't know, maybe if there's a spectrum of perfect fit for strategic narrative framework and then not a fit at all. What's along that spectrum?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:44:33):\nYeah, well you can see, I mean it takes a little time to tell this story and you were kind of framing it a little bit and we're telling it in lots of different channels. So I think it does really play well in this enterprise sales context because also we have a group buyer there. So it's not just one person who's doing some research. This whole group has to have a uniting story. So I think you're right that in noticing that the companies that this tends to resonate with tend to be B2B, enterprise sales, technology I think because often the product is very complicated. That arrogant doctor stuff comes from an age when the things people were selling were products on shelves that didn't change much, cans of soup at the supermarket or a car in a dealership. Even software back then, shrink-wrapped in a box, doesn't change.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:45:44):\nB2B software, this stuff is changing by the minute. And does it even make sense to make a claim to say, \"Oh, we have these features and they have those features, therefore we're better,\" does that make any sense? That said, hey, I was looking for a sports watch, a Fitbit and I'm comparing specs and I'm doing all that stuff. And so that mode of buying is still happening, but I think, so yeah, when consumer products companies contact me, I usually say, \"No.\" Occasionally they still say, \"Okay, yeah, we'll build this, we still want to have this narrative.\" But yeah, I think it has the most value, most impactful right away for B2B enterprise technology companies.\n\nLenny (00:46:33):\nJust a few more questions. One is just what's a sign that you should spend time in this area, that something is broken in your strategic narrative story pitch?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:46:42):\nWell, I can tell you what I hear from CEOs when they contact me. I always ask, what's happening? Because that idea I had, no CEO's going to budget a line item for this. I'm basically asking, why was I wrong? So a few things they tell me, one is that the company is maturing from a point a stage where they've been successful, but that success is ... one CEO put it this way, was brute force of the founders. So the founders are in every meeting, they're in every product discussion, every sales call, and that's shifting, the company's getting bigger.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:47:21):\nUsually I'm seeing this around series B where the company is getting ... so they can't be in every sales call, every market call and they're looking to transmit all the good stuff and some direction in a way that people are going to remember and all that. Everything from how we pitch to what the product should be and all that, and they see this as that.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:47:47):\nThere's another point that I see people contacting me at, which is where they're growing. It's usually a bit later where they've scaled tremendously successfully. Now we're either acquiring or building out whole new product units. And that old story we told is just, it's just not big enough and we got to expand it to something bigger. This is the example of OneTrust, which the CEO I had on my podcast recently. Starts out with just, I think it's data privacy around the regulations that people have to be able to say, \"Don't track me,\" things like that. And then they buy these other company and now we have this much bigger offering. So how do we tell the story? And then I guess the third one is some form of pivot where hey, we were telling an old story but whatever, the market changed or whatever and we want to go in a different direction.\n\nLenny (00:48:53):\nSay a founders listening to this and they're like, \"Okay, I realize I need to do this. I haven't spent enough time on this. Something's not working. This could be a huge unlock for us.\" What are the first couple steps they could take to start to figure this out? And I imagine at some point it's like, go talk to Andy. He'll help you through this. Is there stuff you can do on your own? How do you go about figuring this out?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:49:11):\nWell, a lot of folks have emailed me over the years like, well I told you before, there were some who emailed me like, \"Hey, tried it, didn't work.\" But many more have emailed me, \"Hey, I tried it, it did work. Thank you.\" And so yeah, just try to lay out that structure and try it mean",

Thank you.\" And so yeah, just try to lay out that structure and try it mean even when I work with teams, I adapt what people might call sort of lean approach. I want to get that thing out there into sales calls. We're not rolling it out to the whole sales team right away, but getting it out into some sales calls and get a sense, \"Hey, is this resonating? Are people given the nods?\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:49:49):\nIdeally by the way, one way I look to test it, is it working, is when we talk about this shift and the stakes and do they stick. Do they kind of say, \"Yeah, let me tell you how that's playing out for us,\"? Or, \"Am I? Yes, I'm seeing that.\" Sometimes I'll literally, I'll train salespeople to ask them that question, like, \"Am I crazy or are you seeing this?\" And what do they say? And you can usually tell if they're in and it's qualitative. But I really like that kind of testing to see if it's working. And I think anybody can do that.\n\nLenny (00:50:32):\nIs there a template or guide you have online for folks to follow other than maybe just listening to this podcast and reading? Is there a post that's like, \"Here's the framework defined, and go follow these steps,\"?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:50:41):\nI mean, I guess the closest is that The Greatest Sales Deck I've Ever Seen post, which is the Zuora deck. But even there, people have asked me for a framework and presentation companies say, \"Can we have your template so we could make it available to people? We'll revenue share with you or something.\" And I am so against this template. Every team I work with, it's different. It's not the same number of slides. Sometimes we can lay out this shift in one slide, sometimes it just feels better or the team likes it better, whatever, if it's a few and we're sort of getting people into it. Sometimes there's no slides. So I am really hesitant to recommend any template. And what I'd say is these are principles for building it, not any prescribed formula.\n\nLenny (00:51:37):\nIf they do want to reach out to you while we're on this topic, what's the best way to contact you?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:51:42):\nConnect with me on LinkedIn. That's usually a good one. And I'm usually posting things on LinkedIn that I've learned from working with other teams.\n\nLenny (00:51:52):\nAwesome. Last question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Speaking of LinkedIn, you posted how in a working session with companies that the second session is always this low point they all go through and that everyone's starting to get discouraged and pained. And first of all, I love the expectation setting. You're like, \"This is going to suck initially and it'll get better.\" Why is that the low point and what is it that they focus on in that second session?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:52:17):\nWell, apparently I'm not doing enough of an expectation setting, because what that post was about was this woman. So when I work with a CEO I always ask them to create what I call a strategic narrative team of up to four people. And usually those are leads of marketing, sales, whatever. In this case, the CFO was a really important person in this company. And so the CEO wanted her as part of this team. And she said to me at the end, she's like, \"I love where we got to.\" I always ask, \"What worked? What didn't work?\" And she's like, \"I love where we got to. That worked great. What didn't work was like, you told us that this second session was going to be bad, but I think you could have drilled home more like exactly how bad.\"\n\nAndy Raskin (00:52:58):\nAnd then I asked her, \"Actually, could I have that quote with your face on a slide that I now present to future teams?\" She said, \"Yeah, you could do that.\" So the way I work it is I have a kickoff session where essentially I'm asking people on the team, what are these pieces? What is this old game, new game shift? How do we talk about when to set the stakes and everything I just took you through? And we have like five people in the room. There's going to be ... we're going to come out of this with notes and notes, boards and boards of ideas of this stuff.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:53:34):\nAnd so then two things happen. One is I ask the team to start interviewing customers about how they see this shift and sometimes the customers will literally give us the words and that can be helpful in sort of aligning if we have differences. But I also start working with the CEO one-on-one and we build a first version of this thing, and it's the second session where we present this first version to the team and think about what's happening.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:54:02):\nThe team has just given us millions of gold ideas, truly they're all ... and in order to make something sort of clean and powerful, the CO and I have had to pretty much throw out all of them, save one or two. And there's going to be feelings about that",

And there's going to be feelings about that, first of all. Second of all, if this were easy to just get all ... interview everybody, come up with it, they would've done it. So it's going to be wrong.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:54:30):\nBut the good news is this is where the team gets to weigh in. I also ask, what's working, not working in this thing? And when we learn how it's not working, that gives us the juice to then me and the CEO go back to the drawing board. We plan on this in advance, we're going to go back to the drawing board and then bring up something good. So having a shit draft is a million times more valuable than having all these great ideas. But it's also really painful. It's painful not only for them, but for me. No matter how many times I say this, I expect they're going to love it in that first one too. And I'm really pissed off when they don't. But luckily now I've done enough times I know that's going to happen.\n\nLenny (00:55:20):\nI was just watching a documentary about Annie Lamont who came up with the first draft concept for writers that I stick to.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:55:27):\nI'm a firm believer in that. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:55:30):\nAs you're talking, one last thought that I had is, so you'd work with because and founders. I feel like this could be just as useful to product leaders, product managers working on a product that they're launching, just like what is the movement, where it's happening, here's why this product's important. Do you find that too?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:55:45):\nAbsolutely. And very frequently, the product leader, chief product officer is part of this group. What I'd say though is that the reason ... so after I did this work for a few years, I looked back and I was like, which were the engagements I did where I can see it, and the narrative is really this true north star for everything?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:56:10):\nIt was always the ones where the CEO was leading it, not just in name, but literally the person who called me who was working on the drafts with me and going through. And so initially I didn't insist that it would be the CEO doing that, but eventually I started to, and I think even for a product leader, you're going to want the support. You don't want to be just telling that story in product. You're going to want that supported from this Zuora person who gave me the initial deck, he said it, \"It was like I had air cover and I was just going down and knocking down deals on the ground.\" You're going to want that air cover in marketing, sales, recruiting, everything. And how much better is it if it's really driven by the CEO and you have that?\n\nLenny (00:57:01):\nAmazing. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on or you want to share before we get to our very exciting lighting round?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:57:07):\nNo, except I love category design people and it's really just sort of terms that I like that are ... you know what? Forget it. Scratch that part.\n\nLenny (00:57:19):\nI thought that was funny.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:57:21):\nOh yeah. Okay. Yeah, we could leave it in. We could leave it in. You could even leave this in where I'm telling you to scratch it.\n\nLenny (00:57:26):\nSounds good. I was actually going to joke that I was going to cut this out and leave you hanging, but okay.\n\nAndy Raskin (00:57:31):\nNo, you can do that. Yeah. Category design people. Love you. Don't hate me. Thank you.\n\nLenny (00:57:37):\nGreat. I love it. We're going to be okay, I think. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:57:46):\nI'm ready. I saw like what you sent them, but I didn't really look at them, so I'm just going to tell you what I said. I'll go off that.\n\nLenny (00:57:52):\nPerfect. Excellent. The best version of this. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:57:59):\nOne of the books that I read initially from that Barnes & Noble, it was Story by Robert McKee. I think a lot of people know about it who are sort of interested in story stuff, but it's kind of a Bible of people who are doing screenwriting and stuff. If anyone who's in Hollywood who thought about going to Hollywood, they know about this book. I love a book called Out of Sheer Rage. It's really not about what I do or anything, but the author is Geoff Dyer. Geoff, he's written a lot of books that are kind of essay memoir, and this is a book about him trying to write a book about DH Lawrence. So it's all about procrastinating and like, \"Oh, I'm supposed to write this book. I'm about to go on a trip somewhere. Should I",

Then I could come back refreshed without having ...\" Basically, it's all that. It's this sort of in the head. I just really enjoy that book.\n\nLenny (00:58:59):\nWhat's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:59:03):\nStation 11. Station 11. That was just so beautiful to me.\n\nLenny (00:59:09):\nTrippy. That was a trippy movie. Did not expect to go where it went. I usually ask what's a favorite interview question you like to ask, and I don't know how often you're interviewing people, but does anything come to mind when I ask that?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:59:21):\nWell, I can tell you one thing I ask when I speak with CEOs is I like to ask, what role has this narrative played in your leadership? How does it work in your leadership? And it's always really interesting for me to hear that, 'cause I often hear things that I don't expect.\n\nLenny (00:59:39):\nWhat's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you just really like?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:59:43):\nI recently got a Fitbit. I think I may have mentioned it earlier. I was looking for a product like that, and so far I'm really loving it.\n\nLenny (00:59:53):\nAmazing. Have you tried other versions of Fitbits or that's the one that's working?\n\nAndy Raskin (00:59:58):\nI also ordered a Polar at the same time and wound up returning the Polar. Basically, it was just a little clunkier on my wrist, so I went with a Fitbit. Well, do you have one that you recommend instead?\n\nLenny (01:00:13):\nI just have the Apple Watch and I've never tried a Fitbit and it gives me all this stuff that seems cool, but I've never gone further.\n\nAndy Raskin (01:00:21):\nI got the Fitbit like a week ago and I actually still am on the fence whether I bring it back to return it for the Apple Watch, so I'm enjoying it, but we'll see.\n\nLenny (01:00:28):\nOkay. Final question. You're expert on presentations and I imagine you spend a lot of time in decks, and so just what's like one small change people can make to how they put together a deck or a presentation that will make their presentation a lot better?\n\nAndy Raskin (01:00:41):\nThis is the one thing, make the title the takeaway of the slide so that the person looking at it has to do zero work to take away. So example, you'll sometimes see, \"The problem,\" or, \"The team.\" Replace, \"The team,\" with, \"Our team is veterans of whatever industry,\" or every single slide it's a takeaway, not a label. It'll make everything flow a lot better.\n\nLenny (01:01:17):\nYou did a killer job answering the lightning round questions without having a peek at what they were going to be. Andy, this was incredibly insightful. I'm going to go start working on my strategic narrative for my podcast and newsletter. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, maybe consider working with you? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAndy Raskin (01:01:35):\nSo I mentioned LinkedIn as a way to connect with me. That's fine. My website is AndyRaskin.com. I also have a podcast where I talk with CEOs, so if you're interested in hearing more details about actual use of this, it's called The Bigger Narrative. My mom introduces every episode. I sent her the interviews in advance. I call her and interview about what she thinks people will get out of it, and that conversation becomes the intro to the podcast episode. And what was the last question?\n\nLenny (01:02:04):\nHow can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAndy Raskin (01:02:06):\nUseful to me. Just if you try any of this stuff, let me know. Like, \"Hey, worked. Didn't work. Have this question.\" I would love to hear that stuff.\n\nLenny (01:02:17):\nAmazing. Andy, thank you again for being here.\n\nAndy Raskin (01:02:20):\nThanks so much for having me, Lenny. This is really fun.\n\nLenny (01:02:22):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

And the second piece is, \"I want someone that's going to champion and be a change agent to do things that may be hard but actually best for the long-term interest of the product or company, even though those things are not going to be easy to execute on.\" And I think if you have one without the other, ultimately people are not going to see you as strategic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):\nToday my guest is Anneka Gupta. Anneka is Chief Product Officer at Rubrik, a lecturer on product management at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business and on the board of Tinuiti. Previously, she was President, GM, and head of product at LiveRamp, where she spent 11 years and joined as one of their earliest employees. A bunch of former guests recommended Anneka Come on this podcast and you'll soon see why.\n\n(00:01:03):\nIn our conversation, Anneka shares a ton of powerful advice on navigating difficult personalities, giving and hearing hard feedback, bringing humor and gratitude to every situation, managing your energy versus managing your time. Super tactical tips for how to become more strategic and how to make better decisions, and also how to break into product management for people that are trying to become product managers. There's something in this episode for everyone and I am excited for you to learn from Anneka. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Anneka Gupta. Anneka, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:01:51):\nThanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:52):\nSo, I want to start with a question that I've started to ask guests that come on the podcast that have had extraordinarily successful careers and also just consistently successful careers. So here's the question. What do you believe are one or two skills or mindsets or habits that you think most contributed to your success that you think might be helpful for other people to learn and build to help them have more successful careers?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:02:18):\nSo it's funny, before we kicked this off, you talked about the post-it that you have on your computer that says have fun. My one mindset that I really have leaned into after someone actually gave me advice on this is to figure out how to have fun in my job, even in the most difficult of times. The reason why I say that is because when you're hit with really hard times, it's easy to operate from a mindset of scarcity and to look at everything as an unachievable hurdle to overcome. And when I was able to switch my mindset and say, \"Well, I'm actually going to figure out a way to have fun with this,\" it actually changed my entire for how to deal with super difficult situations.\n\n(00:03:03):\nThis advice specifically came up to me when I had a scenario where I had to essentially change out all of my direct reports in very short order, and I figured that out. It was a super daunting situation. I didn't know how I was going to manage and at first I felt so scared by what was ahead of me and how much change I was going to have to go through in a very short period of time. But when I got this advice, I started to try to reframe my thinking and it actually really made it so that I was able to get through that hard time and opened my mind up to so many more opportunities. So, now I try to embody that in every situation that I come across where I'm faced with something super, super challenging.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:45):\nI love this advice. It's something that I've recently seen also in public speaking. If you can just reframe your thinking from \"I'm scared of this\" to \"This is going to be fun. I'm going to have so much fun doing this. It's going to be like this energy and anxiety I'm feeling is me feeling like it's going to be a lot of fun.\" So, spending a little more time here, how do you actually do this? So in this case, you shared an example of basically you have to fire a bunch of people, not something one can quickly think about how to have fun with that. How did you do this? Is it just in your mind you're like, \"I'm going to have fun with this,\" or is there something tactically people can do to make something fun?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:04:18):\nI think there were a couple of things that I did and I've continued to do. One is figure out and really look at the situation and ask myself, what can I learn from this situation? What can I get out of this that's a positive outcome even though it is incredibly challenging to be facing it right now? So that's one thing that I've done. The second thing I think that has been really helpful is in going into meetings or other situations where I was trying to figure out how to collectively solve some big challenge, figuring out how to bring humor into the meeting. Just starting it on a light note and that elevated my own mood and way I was approaching the meeting, but also adds a level of levity to the situation for other people as well, which I think as a leader is super important because it's not just about your own mindset, but how are you transferring that mindset to the people that you're working with and the people that are",

So part of it is just like, \"How do I add a little humor?\" Part of it is just thinking, \"How do I make this fun?\" Is part of this just like this is not as important as people make it out to be and we could just have a little fun with this thing. It doesn't have to be like we're not curing cancer.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:05:28):\nYeah, definitely I think that helps. Reflecting on this too, I feel like a lot of it comes down to the amount of emotional and mental energy I can bring to solving a problem. And there's always so much going on in life, like personal life as well as professional life, trying to figure out how can I architect my day and time to maximize my energy and be able to bring my full self to work and to these difficult so that I can have that mindset to look at things more broadly versus operating from a place of scarcity. That may come down to simple things like making sure that I have lunch. Sometimes when things get so busy you're like, \"Oh, I'm just going to grab a protein bar and I'm going to skip lunch.\" But I found that that really decreases my energy.\n\n(00:06:15):\nOr, trying to do things that are really difficult late in the day. Five to 6:00 PM is my worst time of day and I know that about myself, so I'm not going to schedule in my most difficult meeting or writing up a strategy deck or something for that period of time because I know that that's not going to be my best and it's actually going to make it more difficult for me to get the work done. Being able to manage my energy levels and figuring out how to schedule my time for my energy has really allowed me also to figure out how to have that abundant mindset in all situations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:50):\nThis episode is brought to you by the Enterprise Ready Conference, a one-day event in San Francisco, bringing together product and engineering leaders shaping the future of enterprise SaaS. The event features a curated list of speakers with direct experience building for the enterprise, including leaders from OpenAI, Vanta, Checker, Dropbox and Canva. Topics included advanced identity management, compliance, encryption, and logging essentially at complex features that most enterprise customers require. If you're a founder, exec, product manager or engineer tasked with the enterprise roadmap, this conference is for you. You'll get detailed insights from industry leaders that have years of experience navigating the same challenges that you face today. And best of all, it's completely free since it's hosted by WorkOS. Spots are filling up quickly. Make sure to request an invite at EnterpriseReady.com. That's EnterpriseReady.com.\n\n(00:07:47):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Command AI. If you're like me and most users that I've built product for, you're probably used to chatbots at the bottom right of websites where you ask a question and it says something like, \"Check out these three helpful articles. Did that answer your question?\" And then you click away and then a few seconds later you get bombarded with some other useless pop-ups. For those of us who work on software, no one wants their product to feel like this. Command AI is an AI power toolkit for support, product, growth and marketing teams that embeds in your company's product.\n\n(00:08:19):\nThe AI support agent can deflect upwards of 80% of support questions providing actually useful answers, and it can magically co-browse with your users to show them around your interface. They do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. Command AI works with web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, LaunchDarkly, and over 25 million end-users interact with Command AI interfaces. To try out Command AI, you can sign up at command.ai/Lenny and experience a custom demo of how it works in your app. That's command.ai/Lenny.\n\n(00:09:06):\nI'm going to go in a totally different direction. Before we were recording, we were also chatting about founder mode, and this is recently. This episode we're recording shortly after Paul Graham put out his now classic, instant classic founder mode post. And he had some really interesting takes on ways to think about founder mode, both from product leader perspective, from a founder perspective. So, there's kind of two questions I want to ask, but just broadly, what's your take on founder mode?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:09:33):\nWell, first of all, I think Paul Graham did an amazing thing by putting a name to something so many of us have seen in practice. And while he didn't in his article say this is exactly what this is, I think many, many people that I talked to were like, \"Oh yeah, I recognize this.\" I recognize people that I've worked for, CEOs, that have done founder mode, great founders that have done founder mode poorly. And it opened up a level of discussion that I think is really valuable for everyone to be having, whether you're a founder or you're someone that works for a founder",

And it opened up a level of discussion that I think is really valuable for everyone to be having, whether you're a founder or you're someone that works for a founder.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:04):\nOkay, so I'm going to ask two questions around this. One is from the perspective of working for a founder and founder mode, the other is being a product leader in founder mode. So, first of all, imagine you've worked with a few founders that operate in founder mode. As a CPO, as head of product, that's often a difficult place to be between the founder and the team that are building the thing. What have you learned about how to effectively work as a product leader with a founder in founder mode?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:10:30):\nSo, I think when a founder's in founder mode and if they're doing it well, what they're doing is really deeply understanding the business and then figuring out when to use their power as a founder to either tweak things and send something in a slightly different direction or fundamentally innovate and completely change directions or completely innovate in a totally new area. Now I think the way to use that effectively as a head of product is to recognize that they have that power to figure out how to use that power to get the things done that you know are best for the company. So, I always think about I have all the people around me. Whether they're people on my team, my peers, or my CEO, these are different resources I have to go get a initiative done or get work done in the company.\n\n(00:11:23):\nAnd as having a founder that can effectively operate in founder mode means that I can go and have a conversation with the CEO and say, \"Hey, look, we have this huge opportunity and these are the things that aren't working, and I need your help to help figure out how we can move the needle more substantially in the direction that we need to go.\" And so activating that founder, that CEO to really be able to push the initiative that I think is best by making them an ally in doing so. I think one aspect. The second aspect is, which often happens, it's very difficult for many people and I've had this happen to me many times, is when a founder is like, \"Well, I have this idea,\" and then you may or may not agree that that's the best direction to go in and how do you navigate that kind of situation?\n\n(00:12:10):\nSo, one is actually taking a step back and objectively saying, \"Well, why are they pushing this?\" Maybe it's the wrong mechanism to go actually get done a strategy that's quite important for the company. So having a really deep understanding about why are they asking this, what are they ultimately trying to get at and what is the objective that they're trying to get at and is this the right way to get at it? If the answer is no to that, then you can go have a conversation. If you know what the objective is, you can go have a conversation with that founder and say, \"Hey, look, I know this is what you're trying to do, but maybe instead of looking at option A here of how we go about tackling this, we should have explored these three other options instead.\" And that can help you and help navigate that conversation.\n\n(00:12:53):\nNow sometimes it's difficult to even get to that kind of understanding of the objective because someone might be just super set in their ways of, \"Hey, I really want to go after this opportunity. It's my pet project.\" Then you have to decide as a head of product, do I really want to fight this or do I just give in on this, let it go? And also make sure that we get the stuff done that's most important to the company. You have to make that judgment call as a head of product and decide what is really going to make or break the company. What's the hill that I'm going to die on and is this something that I can shift or is this something that is not worth shifting? Of course it comes down to the personality. I've been very fortunate that I've actually had very few of those situations where the founder has been like, \"Hey, I really want to go in this direction and I haven't agreed, at least with what we're trying to go after, regardless of the mechanism behind it.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:47):\nI really love the point you made, especially about how the founder could be this lever to get things done. When you identify something needs to change, the best way to change that is just have the founder go in there, tell everyone, \"Hey, we're going to do this thing differently.\" It's such like a positive spin on how to leverage founder mode where a founder actually has a lot of power to change that other people in the company don't. Okay, so let's go from the other side. So, I was talking to Nikhyl Singhal who runs the Skip, which is a community you're part of about you. And he said that you're a leader who excels in founder mode, that you operate in founder mode a lot. And so as a product leader, what have you learned about just how to think in founder mode, operate in founder mode, leverage that approach to leading teams, leading product teams?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:14:32):\nYeah, I think it's often easy as a leader to say, \"I'm not going to roll up my sleeves and get into the details of the business or ask",

Are we on track to get there? How are we making decisions? Getting into that level of depth is super important, and then you can decide as a leader, what do you want to do with that information? So there's a lot of information that I collect about what's happening in the organization, the decisions that we're making that I don't do anything with at a point in time.\n\n(00:15:20):\nThat's my choice to make, but I want the information because in understanding the depth and what is happening, I can decide where I actually think I need to go in deep and make either very significant course correction or a small course correction. Then the way that I think about how do I bring my team along for that so they don't feel like I'm coming in and stomping all over the work that they're doing or trying to re-adjudicate a decision, one, is how do I get in there early?\n\n(00:15:51):\nOne of the tactics I use is I ask people to present their strategies for things that I think we may need to do a course correction on, and I have them come in and then I ask them questions and then I make suggestion. And I'm able to do that in a forum where it doesn't feel like I'm coming in and rewriting the entire strategy, but I'm giving them there an opportunity to present their best thinking and then trying to figure out how do I take that and make that better and make them feel like I'm making it better versus stomping all over and dismissing the work that they've done.\n\n(00:16:23):\nI pick a strategic set of areas. So I think about what is most important for the business? What's going to kill the business if we don't get right and what are the biggest opportunities for the business that we need to go after regardless of how difficult it is for us to actually execute on that? By doing that, then at least I have clarity in my mind and I can provide clarity to the team about what is most important and rally the troops around making that stuff happen if that is what is essentially right. And I'll have all the context because I've asked all the questions of why this is right for the business, why is this going to help us with increased margins or get better growth or get into a new persona if that's what we're trying to do as an overall organization.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:04):\nSo in that example, and I love this tactic, you have your team come in, you ask them, \"Tell me what the strategy is for this thing that you're working on.\" What you've seen work is instead of like, \"No, this is broken, this is wrong, this isn't going to work.\" Your approach is ask questions and hope that they see the flaws or gaps. Is that how-\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:17:24):\nYeah, it's ask questions, but you can't always lead someone somewhere with asking questions. It's also sharing a hypothesis. So I might have a particular hypothesis about the business where I might see something like, \"Well, I was talking to security leaders in our customer advisory board recently and I heard this piece of feedback and this is what it made me think about our strategy, what do you think about that?\" And then let them say like, \"Okay, yeah, actually I see this or maybe I have some follow up questions.\"\n\n(00:17:54):\nIt actually opens a whole discussion where I'm still able to provide my perspective and point of view but not completely shut down the discussion. Because what I always worry about is a leader is I'm going to come in and say something, and because I'm one of the more senior people in the room, no one is going to say if they have a concern. And the reality is I'm not always right far from it, but I want to be able to seed an assumption and then have a discussion based on that and then figure out what the right outcome is about what we should do next based on that discussion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:27):\nSpeaking of strategy, you shared with me that at one point in your career you got this feedback that you just weren't strategic enough and that that comment led you to research and dig into what does it mean to be strategic, and also just to level up your strategic mindset and the way you think about strategy. What did you end up with recognizing as being strategic? What is that in your work and in your research? And then how did you actually get better at this work of being strategic?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:18:57):\nI got this feedback once in a performance review and then I actually got it as well a few years ago when I was interviewing for head of product roles and I thought I had made a lot of progress on it, but when I reflected back, I think it actually all came back to the same themes. Which was I think when people say \"I want someone that's strategic,\" what they're really saying is \"I want someone that can come up with and articulate a compelling and simple why behind the decisions and the direction of the company and product.\" So",

The second piece is, \"I want someone that's going to champion and be a change agent to do things that may be hard but actually best for the long-term interest of the product or company, even though those things are not going to be easy to execute on.\"\n\n(00:19:45):\nAnd I think if you have one without the other, ultimately people are not going to see you as strategic. If you're really good at articulating the why, but you're only bringing small ideas to the table, then that's not strategic. If you're championing big ideas but you can't articulate the why behind them in a compelling and simple way, then you're not going to be seen as strategic either. So, that's the formula that I've come up with. This is what it means. And so I focused a lot on how do I make sure I do both of these things? How do I champion a few things that a really big ideas that are going to help change the direction of the company, and then how do I articulate that in a simple and compelling why?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:26):\nThat's such a cool simple way of thinking about this. Is there an example from your work that might illustrate some of this from a project you worked on or a product you built?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:20:35):\nI can take some recent examples. We've been doing a lot of strategic planning for where do we want to be as a company over the next three years, and Rubrik operates in the cybersecurity space. It's a very fast moving landscape. There's a lot of places that we could go as a business, and one of the ways that I've exhibited this, and this is what I recommend to other people too, is sometimes it's really hard to come up with the compelling and simple why behind something and sometimes it's also really hard to come up with a really big idea out of thin air. So these things can be very challenging. The first step that I found as very useful, and I use this tactic every single day in meetings, is just summarization. So, bringing people together, lots of different voices into a room and hearing what they have to say and at various times in the conversation summarizing what people are saying and summarizing what that means in terms of the direction that we could go in.\n\n(00:21:34):\nAnd then that's a checkpoint of saying, \"Okay, this is how I've synthesized what is happening. Is this correct or do we actually need to do another turn because we don't all agree with where we're landing here?\" That summarization, even though I may not be adding a new idea into that, I found people actually view that as strategy. They view the effective summarization as strategy. So I think that's one element. Then what I've also found is that when I summarize what other people are saying and especially multiple different stakeholders, then I can think about offline and not in the context of right in the meeting, sometimes in the meeting too I guess, is how do I make this idea one click better? It's not about how do you do something radically, radically different, but taking ideas and then making it slightly better, slightly better.\n\n(00:22:25):\nWhen you think about that, especially from an outside-in perspective of what are the customer problems we're trying to solve and how are we going to take this to market, and don't worry about how difficult the technical implementation is going to be, then you start to get to these big ideas that can really be the change agent ideas. So, I've started doing this more and more and I think especially in the past three to six months, and I'm seeing a material difference in terms of the number of big ideas that we're going and pursuing overall as a company and also the quality of the strategic thinking that I can bring to the table, and it's been really exciting and rewarding.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:02):\nThere's so much you're sharing that resonates with other podcast episodes. For example, this idea of just going one click better. I had Roger Martin on the podcast where this book, Playing to Win, which is one of the more popular strategy books, and he has this concept of betterment as a way to work on strategy. A lot of people go huge with a big strategy and vision, and his advice is just find the thing that is the biggest constraint and bottleneck to your business right now and just make it better and that's your next step. And then just keep doing that and you'll end up in a much better place over time, even though it feels like you're just doing one little thing. And so I love this idea of just picking one thing and making it one click better. There's going to be an episode that comes out right before this with Alex Komoroske, and he has this concept of the adjacent possible and it's just find the next thing that's possible and focus on that versus some big lofty thing. So I'm just sharing a bunch of stuff, that's not a question.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:23:56):\nThat totally resonates though.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:58):\nOkay, okay. Okay, great. And then the summarization idea, I love it. So tactical, basically any PM can do this just in a meeting just like, \"Okay, let me just summarize to make sure everyone's on the same page",

And then the summarization idea, I love it. So tactical, basically any PM can do this just in a meeting just like, \"Okay, let me just summarize to make sure everyone's on the same page.\" Funny enough, this is the feedback I get on this podcast and I haven't been doing this in our conversation yet, but I often try to summarize the person's point and everyone's like, \"Oh, I love that you do that. That's so helpful.\" So I totally see the power of that in my experience.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:24:22):\nIt also makes people feel heard and especially when you have a lot of diverse voices in the room that may not agree on all things but have valid viewpoints, it helps bring people together and ultimately the diverse perspectives are going to yield better insights and better decisions for the organizations. You want that, but some people shy away from that because it's scary because you have to deal with a lot of conflict and it's a way to kind of move beyond the conflict and get to the heart of an issue, which in my mind, that's what the PM job is all about is getting to the very, very heart of a problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:56):\nIf someone wants to work on this skill of summarizing as kind of a tactic, can you give just an example of how you would do that? Is there like a phrase to use? Is there words or an example you could give of just like here's how it would look in a meeting?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:25:10):\nYeah. So, often if there's a lot of discussion going on, sometimes it can be a little hard to insert yourself. I still may insert myself and say, \"Hey, let me pause here for a second and try to capture what has been said.\" This is what I've heard. I've heard that our customers are having these kinds of challenges. We feel like this is the way that we want to solve these challenges. We have a right to win in this way and therefore we're going to take this action.\n\n(00:25:36):\nIs everyone in agreement with that or is there some dissent about whether that's an accurate portrayal of where we've landed with this conversation? That's the way I'll frame it up and again, ending it on a question so that you're not coming in and just being like, \"Hey, this is where we're at.\" But then inviting people to discuss and say \"Yes,\" or \"No, I agree with 90% of that or 10% off.\" And that helps move the conversation forward because sometimes you'll get stuck in these circular discussions that aren't moving forward and you need to figure out a way to move it forward.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:11):\nAnd then you experience is just doing that makes you look more strategic and gives people the impression you're thinking strategically?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:26:18):\nYes. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:19):\nAwesome.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:26:19):\nThe other way you can do it is if you're in a room with someone and you have a whiteboard is actually summarize on the whiteboard while people are talking and then show your summarized framework or whatever on that. So that's kind of a good way to do it too. If you're having a hard time interrupting the flow of discussion or you don't feel as comfortable thinking on your feet and interrupting and then framing your point of view, you can do that. In Zoom you can also use a chat. I've done that very effectively and said, \"I'm not going to interrupt the flow conversation. I'm just going to summarize in Zoom chat this is what I've heard, and this is what I think we're saying in this conversation.\" And then sometimes that'll get invited back into the broader conversation that's happening live on the Zoom itself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:05):\nThat's a much lower stakes way of doing it, and I'm picturing all the PMs listening to this, they're going to start doing this and there's going to be all these summaries now in Zoom chats and everyone will be like, \"Oh my God, why is everyone sharing?\"\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:27:14):\nAnd then Zoom AI will start just doing it all for you. Then we'll have to think again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:19):\nAnd then PMs are over and AI replaced us all.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:27:19):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:22):\nOkay, so then just to close the loop on becoming more strategic, your advice is when someone's like, \"Hey, you're not strategic enough. You need to be more strategic.\" Your insights is the two things to work on is one, be clear on the whys behind the ideas that you're working on and be very crystal clear. People may not be understanding why you're working on the things you want to work on, the things you're pitching. And then two is actually be the person that makes these things happen, not just put a doc out there. If you're not actually achieving them, people are going to think you're not strategic.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:27:53):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:53):\nAwesome. Okay. I want to talk about decision-making. You have a really interesting perspective on how to become a better decision-maker in relation to being kind of a historian, which I love this concept. Talk about that insight.\n\nAnneka Gupta (",

I want to talk about decision-making. You have a really interesting perspective on how to become a better decision-maker in relation to being kind of a historian, which I love this concept. Talk about that insight.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:28:07):\nYeah, so I was at my previous company for 11 years, so I kind of ended up becoming the historian. And when I joined Rubrik about three years ago, I came into an organization that had a lot of history that I just didn't know about. So one of the things that I decided to do when I joined the company was to really understand what happened in the past. What were the products that we launched that weren't successful? Why weren't they successful? What was the perspective on the history of how we've decided to develop the things that we did and why? What was the perception of different people in the organization? I tried to construct this past knowledge of what had happened and what were the decisions that were made and why were those decisions made, whether they were good or bad it didn't matter, so that I could better understand how to make decisions going forward and to learn from the mistakes that I didn't personally live through.\n\n(00:29:07):\nI think that's the part that's really important about being a historian. You can always be a historian. It doesn't have to be just when you join a company, but even today I'll hear about projects from many years ago that people will bring up and I'll be like, \"Tell me about this project. What happened with it? How did we decide to do this?\" And just really learn and be curious about it because that gives me more context into, well, what is it that we did poorly and how can we do that better? And also, what is the baggage that people have around trying to do something similar again? Because people always come with their baggage of, oh, this hasn't worked before, so why is it going to work now? And as a product leader, you're obviously putting in place a lot of thoughts and ideas around this is what I want to go achieve and these are the initiatives. And some people are going to come and say, \"Well, we've tried that before.\" Especially you've been at an organization that's been around for a while.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:56):\nI've been that guy. We've done this so many times. It didn't work. Why are we thinking about this again? Okay, so the advice is if you're new to a company especially, just study the past decisions that were made and share them out as a part of that and then as a side effect, it'll help you make better decisions because you'll have this history about what the company has done. I love that. Along the same lines of decision-making, I asked your former colleague Rachel Wolan what to ask you, and she said that your parting advice when she left to join a different company was it's not about making the right decision, it's about making the decision. That's like the things she remembered about you most, that parting advice. Talk about why that is so important and your insight there.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:30:42):\nVery easy to get into analysis paralysis before making a decision and say, \"Well, if I just had this one more data point, if I just knew this, then I could make a decision.\" But the reality is that you were always operating off of imprecise information as a product leader. What I've found is that once you commit to a decision, you actually learn more post committing to that decision about what's going to work and not going to work, and you move out of the hypothetical. And as long as your decision is like 70% right, you can iterate on that 20, 30% in either direction, but if you don't commit, then you don't actually get any new information that is high fidelity and high quality. So, I'm a big believer in making decisions...\n\n(00:31:28):\nI know you've had a few guests talk about speed is super important in organizations. Well, I think making decisions quickly and then being able to iterate on them is a form of that. Just make a decision. Don't make it uninformed, but have a strong hypothesis and then just keep testing whether that hypothesis is accurate or not and you'll shift here and there. You might build something that you have to throw away 20% of the work on, but that's okay. It's better than making no decision at all because you won't get any new information if you don't make any decision at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:56):\nAs a PM that might be listening to this, feeling like, \"Okay, yeah, that sounds great.\" But then I make a bad decision and then Anneka is going to be like, \"You messed up here. You've shipped the wrong thing here. It didn't work.\" How do you create a culture where people don't feel that and aren't as afraid of making bad decisions and making decisions with 70% of the information?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:32:19):\nI think part of it comes down to making sure there's a strong hypothesis that everyone understands when you're making the decision. Or it might not just be one hypothesis, it might be a series of hypotheses and assumptions that we're making that are informing the decision. So it might be a hypothesis that this segment of customers is going to be willing to pay for this product because it's solving an urgent and important enough need for them that they're going to go do it and this is the evidence we have to find it, but this is also the stuff we",

And so at the end of the day, if something didn't work out, we can go back to the original hypothesis and say, \"Well, this is what we learned in this process that our hypothesis was actually not true, and we learned all of this after the fact.\" I think the way to make a culture of risk taking and people willing to make these bets and go out on a limb is to reward the learning versus the outcome. That's what I try to focus on is if we're constantly learning, it is okay if we make bad decisions, but we learn from them and we get better for next time. Even in making this bad decision, we learn something about our customers or our business that we otherwise wouldn't have learned that we can use in another context.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:40):\nFirst of all, I love that this comes back to your strategic lesson of just if you have a strong why behind something, that's incredibly powerful and people will be confident that you're thinking strategically. Two, I was just at a talk with Zuck. He's being interviewed at the Chase Center, the Acquired Podcast at this whole event, and his main thing that he talked about that he values most in the culture of Facebook is learning faster than anyone else. Shipping stuff that isn't perfect, but just so that you can get one more turn and learn something faster than someone else. So, that super resonates that's Facebook's culture. Is there an example of something you worked on where you did that, where you kind of ship something that you weren't fully confident in and you learn faster?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:34:26):\nYeah, I mean, I think there's a lot because anytime you're shipping products, there's so many different things that could go right and wrong. There's a situation where we created a really amazing high value product and we decided not to monetize it, and then we realized after the fact, \"Wait, we should have monetized it. So, we're trying to figure out how to package some new capabilities to monetize this thing that we know has a lot of value without taking away what we've already given to existing customers.\" So that was something we learned along the way that we originally didn't think, oh, we should monetize this, but then we realized that there's actually an avenue to do that after the fact. There's been other things where we've developed a set of capabilities thinking that it will solve for this new persona's problems, but then we misunderstood how easy it was going to be to go sell to that new persona within our own organization. I've made that mistake many times actually.\n\n(00:35:26):\nAnd so now I think now what I've taken from that is really know how you're going to sell something and who's going to do the selling before you actually go build out the product. Because if you don't have that right focus, you may build out the best product and yet it's going to get zero adoption because no one in your organization is ready to sell it. So there's tons of stuff like that where it's like been okay, yeah, we've learned something from this, and it's not all throwaway, it just means that we've got to do something differently for this product and we need to do something differently for our organization going forward.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:01):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo.

By the way, first of all, she spent a lot of time raving about how amazing you are first. That was the first set of conversations, and then she came up with a bunch of questions to ask you. And so her other question was about how good you are at navigating very difficult personalities. She showed this quote that she constantly saw you interact with and bring together several leaders who had much higher egos and very disparate points of view who are not informed or thoughtful or as gracious as you were, and she also said you have very low ego",

She wanted me just to ask you for what you've learned about how to navigate very difficult personalities and help people align when it's not neatly what they want to do.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:38:06):\nI try to embody the mindset of feeling like and believing that I can work with anyone. I think what I do when I hit a difficult personality and difficult personalities come in all shapes and sizes and forms is I really try to understand what drives that person. What is it that they really care about? Hopefully they care about something deeply about the company and making the company successful. Sometimes they care about their own personal career, how they're showing up, what people view of them. That's fine. I just need to understand what it is that they really care about, and then if I need something from them, what is it that I can do to motivate them to find what I need from them important? And trying to make that match of they have this desire kind of like building a product, they have this desire and how am I going to get them to care about the thing that I want to care about?\n\n(00:39:08):\nThe other thing I do is instead of feeling like anger or frustration with the person and instead trying to shift that to a mindset of feeling gratitude and a positive emotion about them is I look at them and I ask myself what can I learn? Maybe I don't want to adopt their personality or operate the way that they are operating, but everyone has something that they can teach you, whether it's their communication style or the way they're able to marshal people together, the way they come up with visionary ideas, whatever it may be, trying to study that person and be curious about them, learn from them and then thank them for that and feel the generosity genuinely about what I got from this situation. It's easier to do sometimes than others, but I think it comes back to that abundant mindset. If you can approach it with an abundant mindset, then you can really consciously do this and when you actually learn something, you will feel the gratitude when you recognize that you are able to get something from that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:13):\nI love that this connects with your other original piece of advice of just turning something into this is going to be fun. Let's make this fun. And in this case it's like make it great. What can I learn from this person even though they're really annoying me and it's frustrating and don't want anything done? Then your other point of understanding what they want and kind of using that as a way to pull them in your direction, how do you figure out what they want? Do you have any tricks for just like, \"Here's how I learn what this person's motivations are and goals are\"?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:40:42):\nTalk to other people that have worked with them before and have done so successfully. So that might be people that work for them because if you work for a person like that, you have to figure out and or you're successful working for that person, you probably understand what makes them tick. So that's one, or talk to people that are peers, anything like that to try to understand and build this view of this person that helps me empathize with them and also helps me understand what they may be wanting to get out of a situation and why.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:16):\nI love that. Yeah, they don't have to be involved in that. You just ask other people, \"What is this person's motivations?\" And then the idea is connect what they want with the thing you're trying to achieve. Beautiful. I really love this idea of when you're frustrated by someone just reframing it to like, \"I'm grateful I'm going to learn something from this person in our interaction, even though they're making life hard for me.\" I really love that. Another skill I hear you're really strong at, and this comes from another one of your colleagues, Hema Mohan shared that you're world-class at giving feedback, giving hard feedback, and receiving hard feedback. And so I want to just ask you, what have you learned about how to do this? It's very hard to give hard feedback. That's why it's called hard feedback. So from either direction, what have you learned about receiving hard feedback or giving hard feedback where someone actually hears Zoom doesn't get defensive?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:42:07):\nThe answer is so much, I've learned so much from it. So maybe I'll start with receiving feedback. So, on the receiving feedback side, I think it's very natural to feel upset, defensive, all the negative emotions when you first see a piece of negative feedback, whether it's you're reading it in a employee survey or you're receiving it in a one-on-one from a direct report or from a manager or from a peer. And I try to let myself just feel the things that I'm going to feel. Sometimes that's an emotional feeling, sometimes that means I want to step out of the room or it depends on who I'm talking to, but let myself feel the things that I'm going to feel. Then once that's passed, whether that's a few hours or a few days, don't react. Don't try to say, \"Oh, I don't believe this.\" Listen. And then ask myself, okay, well where is this feedback coming from? Why am I getting this feedback?\n\n(00:43:07):\nAnd try",

And then ask myself, okay, well where is this feedback coming from? Why am I getting this feedback?\n\n(00:43:07):\nAnd try to be super curious about it. And that might be going back to the person that gave me the feedback and maybe asking someone that's a peer somewhere in the organization that might have more context and flavor to what the feedback really is, just trying to learn. Then I can decide, do I think this is valid or not? Is this something I should do something about or not? Actually, all feedback I think is valid. People's feelings are valid, but it doesn't mean that you need to do something about all of those things. Going through that process and letting myself ride the emotional wave and not judging myself for that, but then not reacting and letting myself then figure out and come back curious. I think when you come back curious, people then want to give you more feedback because they know that you're listening and that you're hearing what they say.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:55):\nSo the advice is feel it, don't block it off and be like, \"No, no, no, no, no, this isn't real.\" So fully let your body go through the roller coaster of feeling the negative feedback. Sometimes the feedback is just like, \"No, this isn't actually a thing.\" Do you have any just heuristic of like I should actually pay attention to this deeply or just like let me wait for more data points?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:44:15):\nYeah, I think in product you receive feedback all the time for your organization or for yourself, and you can't make everyone happy. Everyone wants a different thing from product. So I think this comes up quite often where there's a lot of feedback for the organization or for you as a leader and you have to decide what to focus on and what not to focus on. I always try to anchor on, \"Well, what is best for the company and what does the company need for me and for my team at this point in time?\" There's stuff that is a must-have on that list, and there's stuff that's nice to have. Sometimes there's just too many must-haves to go deal with the nice-to-haves and you have to just be like, well, I know this is a problem, or I know we could be 10% better in this, but it actually doesn't matter as much as fixing these things that are really, really important and are really what's going to help my organization deliver what it needs to for the company and for the business overall.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:13):\nIn terms of receiving hard feedback, so you shared one example or I shared an example where someone said you weren't strategic enough. Is there another example of receiving hard feedback that you got that you're like, \"Ugh, that sucks\"? Either earlier in your career or more recently, anything else come to mind?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:45:26):\nI mean all the time. So there's always hard stuff. Well, people will give feedback of, \"Oh, I feel like we're not moving fast enough on our roadmap and priorities. We need to be doing more. Why aren't we moving fast?\" Or-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:47):\nNever heard that one before.\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:45:48):\nNever heard that one before, right? Or disparaging the direction that we're taking a certain product because they don't agree with it because a competitor is doing something else, but we've decided for our reasons that we're not going to go follow that path. There's always something that people have negative feedback about and sometimes I'm like, \"Okay, this is an eye roll.\" I understand where they're coming from. I understand why they're giving me this feedback, but I also don't agree that we should change directions because of it. I don't know, some of the things cut deeper than others, but I think people are making personal statements about my team or they're feeling like, \"Hey, the product team isn't listening to feedback, or the product team has a bad culture. Anneka isn't listening.\" Things like that cut deep and are a lot more... I know like physiologically they make me kind of seize up a little bit, but again, then I try to feel the things I'm going to feel and try to understand why are they saying that. Why do they really feel that and what does that mean behaviorally that I have to do differently or my team has to do differently or maybe just two people on my team need to do differently and someone is extrapolating this out to be a much bigger problem than actually is?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:59):\nAwesome. Okay, and then we were going to shift to what you've learned about giving hard feedback so that someone actually listens and doesn't just put up a shield and like, \"It's not real.\"\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:47:10):\nSo I think in giving feedback, you can never fully control how someone else is going to respond to that feedback. All you can control is what you do, your body language and what you say. What I have found is that if I can convey, and I will say this very directly to people, I care so much about you and I'm giving you this feedback because I want you to be successful and I want you to be able to reach the pinnacle of what I know you can accomplish. And you do all of that setup and you don't just hope that they understand that",

What I have found is that if I can convey, and I will say this very directly to people, I care so much about you and I'm giving you this feedback because I want you to be successful and I want you to be able to reach the pinnacle of what I know you can accomplish. And you do all of that setup and you don't just hope that they understand that, you actually explicitly say that and you show that in your body language, then it makes the other person much more receptive to hearing whatever you have to say. Then I think the other piece is that you've got to be direct.\n\n(00:47:57):\nThe worst feedback is the kind of passive-aggressive feedback versus saying directly this is what you are doing or this is how you are being perceived in the organization, and here are the three things that you can do to change the way you're being perceived or to change the outcomes of what you're driving or become more strategic or whatever it is that I'm trying to give feedback on. I do a lot of prep before I give someone a lot of feedback. I really think about how can I frame this in a way that's going to resonate with them that doesn't come across as attacking them, but helps them understand why what they're doing isn't working or is being perceived poorly? And try to give them examples and even examples that I've personally had to go through myself of how I've approached those situations. And let them ask questions and brainstorm with them, be part of the solution versus saying like, \"Here's all this feedback, now you go figure out what to do with it.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:56):\nThis reminds me of Radical Candor. Basically make people feel like you care deeply about them, but be very direct about what they can be doing better. Are there phrases or ways that you set up the conversation? You mentioned a few of just like, \"I want to help you become the best version of who you could be and what you're capable of.\" Is there any phrases you find helpful that you come back to often of just a way to start the conversation?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:49:21):\nYeah, I think what I started with is like, \"I care a lot about you. You have a lot of potential. I can see you doing these kinds of things. I can see you getting to where you want to go in your career.\" Sometimes I even start the conversation by asking them, \"What do you want to do? Where do you want to go in your career?\" And that will help me frame up which of these things are important. Because honestly, if someone wants to be eventually like a CPO, the feedback I'm going to give to them is very different than if they're like, \"Hey, I don't really want to manage people ever. I just want to be the best I see I can ever be.\" I'm not going to give them the same feedback. And so having that conversation up front also allows them even before I jump into the feedback to give them their perspective of what they want and then I can tailor the conversation more to what they're looking for.\n\n(00:50:04):\nI think that has really helped as well make sure that I focus on the things that are going to really matter. During the feedback conversations, I also try to frame things as this is how you're being perceived than you are doing X. Because I think even though it's hard to hear, \"Oh, hey, this person doesn't perceive you in the way that you may think,\" then we can talk about, \"Well, what are ways that we can change the perception?\" I also think it's important because sometimes people are like if you say, \"Hey, I don't think you're X,\" and then they're like, \"Well, yes I am.\" And if you're saying, \"Hey, well this is how other people perceive you including me, but maybe this is not what you are intending,\" and you actually say that, you're giving them the benefit of the doubt of actually how they're trying to show up is different than how people are perceiving them. You can have a better conversation then around, \"Well, what can you do to change that perception?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:01):\nYou mentioned I see product managers, and this is a good segue too. You're a big deal, fancy chief product officer person. A lot of people listening to this podcast are early career PMs or trying to get into product. I want to ask a couple of questions along these lines. One is about getting into products. So, interestingly, you got into product the same way I got into product, which is you used to be an engineer and then you moved into product within a company, which is maybe one of the simplest ways to get into product potentially. For people that are trying to break into product management, what advice do you often give them of how they could go about doing it? I know there's never the silver bullet, but what's your advice?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:51:41):\nI definitely think doing it within the same company is a lot easier than trying to switch companies and switch jobs at the same time because when you're within a company, you've already built credibility, hopefully. And if you haven't, then go crush it at your job so you build the credibility. Then you can start to raise your hand, interact with the product team, take on projects and do things that allow you to get some experience and build a relationship with a leader on the product team who then may be willing to take a chance on you to put you into a product role even if you don't have the experience. Especially when you're within the same company, you bring other things to the table. Let's say you're working in customer support",

Especially when you're within the same company, you bring other things to the table. Let's say you're working in customer support, well, you have a huge amount of knowledge about what are the big problems that people are calling up the support team or opening tickets on the support team for, and that is valuable knowledge for being a product manager.\n\n(00:52:33):\nYou're coming from the sales side, you're coming with a knowledge of how to sell the product, what really resonates, how do you do the objection handling, and that can be a valuable perspective. If you come from the engineering side, but you understand how the product is built and you understand that technical nuances of that well, that can also be a valuable way to enter into the product team. That way, even though you don't have the direct product experience, you're still bringing something to the table where you are going to have to get trained on core product management, but you're not going to have to be totally trained on the business or the technology.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:06):\nSo is the advice basically get a job in any function, not necessarily any function, but join a company however you can essentially and then push to try to get into the product team in some form?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:53:19):\nYeah, I think join a product adjacent function, which honestly pretty much every function is product adjacent, because what function does product not engage with, but as closely product adjacent as possible, and then yeah, find your way into the product world from there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:34):\nIdeally there's something within the company, there's some program I imagine that does this sort of thing. Some companies have something structured, some are just kind of ad hoc. Is there anything there you're just like should you talk about this in your interview just like, \"Hey, I would really love to become product manager someday.\" Do you have anything along those lines that would help me get into that or not? Or should you not talk?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:53:52):\nWell, I think it depends. For instance, when I joined LiveRamp, which was my previous company as a software engineer, I actually did say in the interview process I want to become a product manager I think. At that point I was still early in my career, I didn't know for sure, but I said that. Now that was a 20-person startup, so it was worth saying it because they didn't really have a product team and I wanted to put it out there that that was something I was interested in growing into.\n\n(00:54:17):\nIf you're joining a 5000-person company, you're hiring manager is probably not going to receive it well if you're like, \"Hey, I'm interviewing for product marketing, but really what I want to do is go into product.\" So, it just kind of depends on the company and the stage. You have to play that wisely. But I think once you're in a company, then finding a way to make a relationship with the product leader, or if you're in a startup that is really small and they don't have product management, well then you have the opportunity to take on projects for sure that are product management related because no one is doing that work. Really taking initiative to do that so that you can find an inroad into product management.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:57):\nKind of along these lines, you have a really unique perspective on new PMs because you teach product management at Stanford. You've been doing that for a while. I just want to ask you work with a lot of people that are new to product, thinking about getting into product, then get into product. What do you find are the things that new PMs or people getting into product most misunderstand about the role of PM or are most surprised by when they become product managers?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:55:23):\nWhen we interviewed students as we were designing the class about what they wanted to learn, what was most surprising to me was that students would say, \"Well, can you teach me how to use Figma? Can you teach me the tools that product managers are going to have to use?\" What was surprising me about that was I don't think it's the tools that you need to learn to be successful. I think what you need to learn to be successful is how to take very ambiguous situations and consistently drive more and more clarity over time. So, it was interesting to see this mismatch between what people said they wanted to learn and what I felt they actually needed to learn.\n\n(00:56:03):\nNow, having taught this class for a few years now, I think talking to students who have then left and become product managers, they've seen a lot of this in practice now and I think they understand that, but there is this mismatch of people who haven't been in product management saying they want to go and thinking that they need to learn some tools or process versus the mindset and the skills required to clarify ambiguity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:29):\nAlong those lines, I actually saw you somewhere in a talk or maybe something you wrote talk about how creating this class and creating the curriculum helped you crystallize your own thinking on product and helped you crystallize the mental models of becoming a product manager. Is there anything that you recall from that time of like here's something that's really helped me understand about this function and the skill as you",

Is there anything that you recall from that time of like here's something that's really helped me understand about this function and the skill as you were putting together the class?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:56:51):\nYeah, I know anytime you're teaching something, you have to figure out a way to synthesize it for another audience, and so many of us have learned product management just figuring it out on the job. I don't know if there's a particular framework that I would say came out of that, but what I found very interesting was seeing the questions that people asked in the class and then feeling like, \"Oh, I understand how to answer this question. I can provide an example for it.\" That was super interesting to me because I didn't expect that coming out of the conversation. Yes, there's frameworks we developed to talk about ideation and product discovery and all of that, but I think those are fairly flexible frameworks.\n\n(00:57:33):\nWhat was most enlightening was being able to crystallize the answers to some of these questions, whether it was about how do you interact as a PM effectively with engineering or what happens if the data shows you that it doesn't matter which direction you pick, like there's merits to both ways. How do you actually go about making those decisions? It was very interesting being able to then have those conversations with students and bring in the real life examples. And I found in some situations that actually go back to my own team and share the same answer that I came up with in class, I was like, \"Oh, this is actually a valuable thing to share with my team back at my company.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:15):\nReminds me of the recent chat I had with this guy Alex Komoroske, where he talked about how oftentimes talking with people helps them uncover new insights that he had in his head and then he writes them down as soon as he says something that's really clever in any way. He's like, \"Okay, I'm going to remember that now.\" Coming back to how to become a PM, so you see all these people getting and taking this class want to become product managers. I know they're like Stanford students and people more likely hire Stanford people. But I guess in terms of how they end up becoming PMs, if you were to look at the pie chart of the people that end up getting a PM job, what's the biggest chunk? Is it they join at some other function and then move into product? Do they just join as a junior PM somewhere? How are people actually getting into the PM role in that class?\n\nAnneka Gupta (00:59:00):\nYeah, I think very few are directly going to an established company and becoming a PM directly, so I would say a big chunk of them. Some of them are, but many of those then had PM experience to begin with or had engineering experience and then went to a technical company into a PM role. The vast majority of them are joining product adjacent roles or they're going to small startups where they might be doing product management, might be the first product manager, or they might be doing product management plus plus, chief of staff, something like that where they get to put their hands in product management, but it's a super small company. So I think those have been the two most successful paths to get into product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:40):\nAwesome. That's a really interesting lens into how people actually get into this role. Potentially final question, but we'll see where it goes. I have this recurring segment on this podcast called AI Corner where I try to get a sense of just how people are finding AI tools useful in their work, in their life. So, let me just ask you, is there anything you've found useful in some AI tool in how you work? Like something you found that helps you work more productively, more efficiently, either you or people on your team?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:00:08):\nOne way that we're using AI today is summarizing our user research calls. So, that has been really valuable because we're doing all these calls all the time, we're getting a ton of rich insights. Some of those rich insights are related to the specific project that we were doing this call for and some of them aren't. And now we have that summarized and tagged in a way where you can look up any sort of thing that you want around the calls that we've done and it'll find you the call, it'll find you the context, it'll find you the transcript and summarize exactly what we've learned from that call. So we're starting to use that more and more. It's very powerful capability. I definitely think that that kind of summarization of information for PMs is a big unlock for organizations and I think we're still in the very, very early days of AI making a meaningful difference to the way that PMs do their work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:01):\nIs there a specific tool that you love to help you with that that you may want to give a shout-out to or is it something you guys built?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:01:07):\nYeah, we use Dovetail and it's been fantastic. Connects into all of the Zoom calls and everything, it does a great job with summarization, with search, everything.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:18):\nAwesome. I love it when someone recommends a very awesome sponsor of the podcast. Dovetail is ongoing and excellent sponsor,",

Anneka, is there anything else that you thought you wanted to share or that you want to leave listeners with that you think might be helpful before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:01:38):\nThe mindset that you bring to your work is actually the most important thing over anything else that you can do. And if you are approaching every situation as much as possible with the positive mindset, you can do more than you could ever possibly hope to achieve.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:56):\nI'm going to pull on this thread because this is such a powerful point and I think it's easy to just hear that. It's hard to learn to do it. Do you have any advice on just how to build that mindset? Like it connects to many of the things you said: how can this be fun? How can I be grateful to this person that's annoying me and the things that they might teach me? Is there just anything you've done that has helped you build this mindset?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:02:20):\nJournaling is very powerful. So actually growing up I journaled every single day of my life from when I was 13 to when I was 23. And while I cringe to go back to read any of those, I think what it helped me do and build a practice around that I still do today is when I have a lot of thoughts going through my head, especially negative thoughts, just putting them all down on a piece of paper, writing them on my phone and trying to explore why am I feeling this way? Why am I getting triggered? What is it about the situation that's making me feel so strongly?\n\n(01:02:56):\nAnd when I put it down on paper, then it takes this thing that's abstract and things that I'm ruminating on and actually makes it possible for me to break it down and understand, \"Well, okay, this is something I may feel, but the why behind it is a little irrational, so let me let this go.\" I realize that this isn't rational way to think about this. Whereas other things I start to uncover, well, what is it about the situation and what is it that I need to do differently? What's within my control and what is it maybe that I need to go talk to someone about and say, \"Hey, I need you to do this differently to be able to make myself feel better and make the situation better.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:34):\nIt's interesting this is another thread that's been coming up a bunch on the podcast recently that when something is bothering you or something is hard, the more you actually listen to that part of yourself and dive into it and explore it and give it a space to share and talk, the less power it gets and the more space is created for the stuff you actually want to take space. It's not what you would expect because usually it's like, \"No, shut up, everything's fine.\" But the more you actually hear that out, the easier things get. So, I love that you share that.\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:04:09):\nIt's like doing cognitive behavioral therapy on yourself. That's how I think of it. I've never actually done cognitive behavioral therapy, but I've read a lot about it and sometimes when I go through this, I'm asking myself the same questions that I think are asked in those settings.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:26):\nLove that. All right, Anneka, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:04:29):\nI think that's all I can think of.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:31):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:04:35):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:36):\nAll right. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:04:41):\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz, such a great book, great again about mindset of how to approach hard things. Second is I'm a huge fantasy sci-fi fan, so I love Brandon Sanderson's books. I highly recommend those to people as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:57):\nAll I know about him is I saw videos of him after COVID where he just said, \"I wrote five new books during COVIID.\" I was like, \"what is going on?\"\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:05:03):\nHe is someone that is at the top of his craft and I admire people so much that are truly the elite in what they do, and he's truly the elite in what he does. He writes a lot about writing, he podcasts a lot about writing. It's pretty impressive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):\nAnd he writes fantasy books, is that right?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:05:18):\nHe writes fantasy, yep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:20):\nOkay, cool. It feels like a lot of books to read though. I'm just like, \"Oh, my God, so many",

    "content": "he does. He writes a lot about writing, he podcasts a lot about writing. It's pretty impressive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):\nAnd he writes fantasy books, is that right?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:05:18):\nHe writes fantasy, yep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:20):\nOkay, cool. It feels like a lot of books to read though. I'm just like, \"Oh, my God, so many books.\" Okay, great. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:05:31):\nAgain, on the fantasy sci-fi track, I really like Fallout, which is a dystopian show based on a post-apocalyptic, post-nuclear war world. It's very entertaining.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:42):\nYeah, it's just very quirky and fun.\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:05:45):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:46):\nAnd unexpected. Awesome. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:05:53):\nMy eight-foot iPhone charger. So I have a cord that's very long that allows me to move around the house and do stuff while my phone is charging because my phone is always running out of batteries. So, highly recommend getting a super long charging cord.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:10):\nI've got one of those and I know exactly what you mean. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful and work during life?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:06:18):\nI think it comes back to dealing with lots of different types of people. I really try to remind myself that everyone has something to teach and everyone has something to learn. I think that helps not only think about how you interact with other people, but also combat imposter syndrome because you have something to bring to the table and teach as well as anyone else, no matter what your age is, no matter what your background, and leaning into that and realizing that people can learn from you and you can learn from others in every single situation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:51):\nFinal question. I heard that you're a big fan of Isaac Asimov. Do you have a favorite Asimov book, one that you'd think if someone were to explore his canon, they might want to start with?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:07:01):\nI really like the Foundation series, so starting with that is really good. It's a very different style of writing. You kind of have to stick with it, but it's good, I promise.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:11):\nAnd I'll build on that and say, \"Don't watch the show because the show is so different from the book series.\" I don't know if you've seen it and-\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:07:16):\nYes, I have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:17):\n... not nearly as good.\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:07:17):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:18):\nI was just like, what is going on? This is not the story.\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:07:20):\nYeah, very different.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:21):\nWhat are they doing? Amazing. Anneka, this has been amazing. We covered so much ground. I feel like this is going to help a lot of people. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to follow up on things, maybe ask you questions or just check out the stuff you're up to and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:07:38):\nYou can find me on LinkedIn, follow me, DM me. I would love to connect. The way you can help me is we're actually redesigning our Stanford class right now for PMs, and I would love to hear from you if you don't have any PM experience, what is it that you wish a class could teach you? And that would be super helpful for me as we're redesigning this class. Thanks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:59):\nAmazing. And the way they could share that is DM you on LinkedIn or Twitter?\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:08:03):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:06):\nEasy. Amazing. Anneka, thank you so much for being here.\n\nAnneka Gupta (01:08:07):\nThanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:09):\nAbsolutely. My pleasure.

    "content": "Annie Duke (00:00:00):\nIt's so incredibly necessary in improving decision quality to take what's implicit and make it explicit. It's not that intuition is crap, your intuition is sometimes right. If you don't make it explicit, then you don't get to find out when it's wrong.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):\nWhen you look at companies that have read your book, what do you find are the brainwashing tactics that really stick?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:00:16):\nPeople generally think the purpose of a meeting is for three things, discover, discuss, decide. The only thing that's ever supposed to happen in a meeting is the discussion part.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):\nSomething that comes up in product a lot is this idea of pre-mortems.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:00:28):\nSo a pre-mortem, it's great only if you set up kill criteria. Commit to actions that you're going to take if you see those signals.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):\nYou have a very interesting framework for how to think about decision quality when the outcome is very long-term.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:00:40):\nThere is no such thing as a long feedback loop. And the way you choose to shorten the feedback loop is to say, what are the things that are correlated with the outcome that I eventually desire?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:53):\nToday, my guest is Annie Duke. Annie is the author of the bestselling book Thinking in Bets, and also her more recent book Quit: The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away. She's also a special partner at First Round Capital, which we spent some time on and is incredibly fascinating. Prior to this part of her career, she was a professional poker player. She's won over $4 million in tournaments, including winning a World Series of Poker Bracelet, and she's the only woman who's won the World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions and the National Poker Heads-Up Championship. Currently, she spends her time helping companies make better decisions. In our conversation, we cover the many lessons that she's learned from her friend Daniel Kahneman, who recently passed away. What simple change she's found has the most impact in a company's ability to make better decisions, how to make better quick decisions when the feedback loop is very long, and also why she doesn't actually believe in long feedback loops, how she changed the way that the partners at First Round Capital make decisions, which is incredibly interesting.\n\n(00:01:51):\nPlus, why when you're thinking about quitting, that probably means you've already waited too long and you should have quit a while ago. I learned a ton from this conversation and this is definitely going to change the way I think about a lot of things. With that, I bring you Annie Duke after a short word from our sponsors.

Annie, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:03:58):\nThank you so much for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:59):\nIt's my pleasure. I was telling a bunch of people that you were coming on this podcast and every single one of them was so excited that we were doing this, so I'm quite excited that this is happening. I want to start with a question about Daniel Kahneman. I know you two were very close. You did a podcast together. I know you grew to be good friends over the past few years. Sadly, he passed away about a week ago at this point.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:04:21):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:21):\nI'm curious, what are some lasting lessons that you took away from your time with him? Maybe one or two things that stick with you and you think will stick with you?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:04:31):\nIt's hard for me to describe properly how humble this man was, and it seems so impossible because his influence was so huge and his intellect was so huge and his insight was so change-making in the areas that he worked. But he was so humble, he really wanted to hear what you thought. He said, \"I",

Maybe one or two things that stick with you and you think will stick with you?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:04:31):\nIt's hard for me to describe properly how humble this man was, and it seems so impossible because his influence was so huge and his intellect was so huge and his insight was so change-making in the areas that he worked. But he was so humble, he really wanted to hear what you thought. He said, \"I don't know a lot\", he would change his mind. It's funny, I got asked in a class that I was teaching about thinking fast and slow and someone was talking about how there's a lot of studies in there that didn't end up replicating.\n\n(00:05:19):\nAnd what I've seen from a lot of other people in the field who really where their work is defined by some line of work that didn't replicate, where they're really arguing against the fact that it doesn't replicate. Just trying to justify or say, \"But no\", or this and that. This real lack of open-mindedness to the idea that you know what? Maybe it turns out not to be true and that should be okay. But the thing about Danny was when you talked about it, he was the first one to tell you, \"I wish priming wasn't in the book. It doesn't replicate.\" He was just so open-minded to the idea that he knows what he knows now, but he knows that he doesn't know everything.\n\n(00:06:06):\nAnother thing that people don't know about him outside of academics I think are that he was one of the pioneers in something called an adversarial collaboration. So one of his favorite things, and he in some ways invented it, was find someone who really disagrees with you and then write a paper with them and try to figure out with them what's the study that would resolve the issue. So an example of that was Danny did work on happiness as it relates to wealth. Kahneman and a collaborator, Angus Deaton, they published a result that got a lot of press about the relationship between money and happiness, and the idea was money doesn't buy happiness beyond $75,000. So that got published in 2010. I'm sure if you ran that exact same study, it would be more than $75,000 now because it would adjust for inflation. But it was like the idea being once your basic needs are met and you're not that worried about paying rent and so on and so forth, it's not going to have that big of an effect.\n\n(00:07:09):\nBut then a decade later, Matthew Killingsworth said, \"That's not true that actually money and happiness are correlated through all the income levels. The more money you have, the more happy you tend to be.\" Okay, so this is a classic example where people will tear each other down sometimes and that guy's wrong and whatever. And instead, it was Kahneman's like, \"All right, let's do it together.\" And they joined forces along with Barb Mellers to basically try to resolve that issue. He was just always seeking out, it was just like everything was like, why am I wrong? And he was eager and he was excited and he wanted to...\n\n(00:07:56):\nI remember having a lunch with him where I realized after the lunch that the whole lunch was him asking me questions about my work. Why is he asking me questions about my work? Right? He's Danny Kahneman. But he was just so curious about other people and he just made time for everybody. He just loved the people around him so much. And I think that in the end, it's hard to believe, but I just think that that dwarfs his body of work, which is spectacular. But he as a human being was just so spectacular. And I do think you hear all the time about people who are so incredibly brilliant. It's the brilliant but asshole thing, and it was just so the opposite with him. He was so kind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:51):\nThat's amazing. And it feels like there's probably a strong correlation between people that are curious, always looking for how they're wrong, and finding time to spend it with people to debate and discuss and ask. Feels like there's going to be a strong correlation with that and finding really interesting insights uncovering new things.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:09:10):\nYeah, yeah, yeah. [inaudible 00:09:12].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:11):\nWell, thank you. Thank you for sharing all that. I wish I had known him. Let's talk about decision-making. So there's two areas I want to spend time on. As one would not be surprised, decision-making and quitting. And I know that you've been on a lot of podcasts. I imagine many listeners have read your book or have heard a lot about the stuff that you teach. I'm going to try to come at this from a bunch of different directions and do it a little differently. First of all, I know you're a parent. As last I heard, you have four kids. I just had a kid, he's almost 10 months now.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:09:43):\nOh, congratulations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:44):\nThank you. I'm curious, what your frameworks you find most helpful in parenting and in raising your kids that have stuck with you there?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:09:53):\nWell, let me just first off say I get a lot of people who are pregnant who come and ask me for my advice about parenting. And I'll tell you the two pieces of advice I give people. The first is this, there's all sorts of parenting books, there's all sorts of styles. A book needs to sell",

And I'll tell you the two pieces of advice I give people. The first is this, there's all sorts of parenting books, there's all sorts of styles. A book needs to sell, so they need to sell you something new or different or whatever, okay. But the only thing that matters really is that your kids know you love them, really know deep in their bones, know you love them.\n\n(00:10:32):\nAnd we can argue breastfeeding versus not breastfeeding or co-sleeping versus not co-sleeping or attachment parenting or sleep training, we can talk about all that stuff, right? Do you homeschool? Do you send them to private school? Do you send them [inaudible 00:10:49]? We can have lots of [inaudible 00:10:51], but it all dwarfs in comparison to your children know that you would lay down in the street in the front of a bus if it meant that they would be alive and happy. That's the number one thing I say. Number two is at some point, you will drop your baby on its head. So I bet this has happened to you already.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:18):\nWell, yeah. Sort of. Okay.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:11:18):\nSort of, right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:18):\nKeep coming.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:11:20):\nSo here's the thing about babies, is babies can't move. And so you get very used to as a mom or a dad or you're sitting on the couch and you're folding laundry and your baby is right here next to you and your baby can't move. And then one day without warning, your baby can roll over. And you think it's fine because you put a pillow there or something, but you turn your back for a second because you're like whatever and then your baby falls on its head. It happened with every single one of my children. And they don't fall that far and whatever, but they're totally fine and you're not a bad parent. And it's just this, there are things you don't know and stuff's going to happen and it's not going to be perfect. And every little thing isn't going to have some lasting impression on your child because at some point, you will drop your baby on its head and you will not mean to, you didn't intend to.\n\n(00:12:21):\nBut in my case, it was always like, oh my gosh, my baby can roll over. I did not think that was going to happen today. And gosh, by the time I got to the fourth one, it's like I'm chasing after one baby to try to get the diaper on and this and that, so then the other baby hits its head. So I think there's just a lesson in that which is like it's a small thing, don't sweat it and don't get mad at yourself because you made a mistake. It's like the mistake would be, oh, I realize my baby could roll over now. So now you should make sure that you're taking extra precautions about your baby rolling over off the couch. But it's really just a funny way for me to say your baby's going to hit its head or walk into a coffee table or get cut or whatever. It's like they're very resilient and you didn't do anything wrong as a parent, so don't beat yourself up about that. And then I do actually have one other thing I say.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:20):\nYeah, go for it.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:13:21):\nBe having four, you have very little, you have no influence whatsoever basically on what your child's personality is. What you can do as a parent is make sure they say please and thank you. So what I find with parents of one is particularly if that one is very well-behaved, they think they're a great parent and they may be. That would be resulting. They may be, but once you have four, what you realize is like, oh, my parenting really didn't have anything to do with it. But my children do say please and thank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:01):\nThis is really valuable, good advice. I need to hear this. My wife is going to need to hear this, too. She's always worried about the soft spot on our kid's head and getting hit into some things.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:14:09):\nNo, it'll be fine.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:10):\nOkay, great.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:14:11):\nIt's actually it's part of why it's there. Really, your baby will be fine. I mean, that's the thing. We used to cart babies around in the wilderness, we were living in case. We're fine, we're built for it. We're built for a much rougher world than the world that babies actually grow up in now. I will say my oldest child when she was in high school, just for whatever reason, she had no interest whatsoever in alcohol or drugs or anything like that. And I remember just feeling so smug about how well I had raised this child and how great she was, and oh, these other parents who clearly weren't doing a good job. I mean, I didn't really but because it's hard not to. And then my next child went through high school and I was like, [inaudible 00:15:02]. That's just a temperament thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:",

That's just a temperament thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:11):\nIt's a good example of resulting in action.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:15:08):\nIt is a good example of resulting, but all my kids have turned out fine and they're all very different, but yeah. But as far as decision-making is concerned, which is a totally different thing, I'll actually quote Danny Kahneman on this one. Nothing is as important as it seems when you're thinking about it, that's a really important one. One of the things that I used to try to do with my kids all the time was mental time travel, which is actually a very good decision tool. So they would be really upset about something and it could be something that happened at school or it could be like they were grounded for something or whatever.\n\n(00:15:46):\nAnd the thing is when you're in the moment, it just feels like so big. And the thing that I used to say and they say all the time now is this is going to be so great for you when you're 40 at Thanksgiving. You're going to be able to tell these stories to your children and it's going to be the best, like you should be thanking me so that you can talk about your crazy mother at the Thanksgiving table. And it allowed them to get some time and space from it to realize this is going to be funny at some point.\n\n(00:16:19):\nAt some point, it's going to be a hilarious story that you tell people. No matter how horrible it seems now, it's going to be a hilarious story at some point when you're older. And it sounds like a fun thing I was doing with them, but it's actually a really good decision-making tool for us in general, right? Look, there are absolutely things that 20 years from now are going to matter, for sure. But most things, no. If you think about most things that ever happen to you, like you're 21 and your girlfriend breaks up with you or whatever and you just think it's the end of the world and you're never going to recover and all these things, but if you could get yourself like, well, how do I really think I'm going to think about this in 10 years? Am I still going to be heartbroken in 10 years?\n\n(00:17:03):\nProbably not. And I think that we need to get that perspective of time so that we can get out of the moment because in the moment it just feels so important and the feelings are so big. And it's like the focusing effect on this second and the feelings you're feeling right now are so huge that we forget the scope of time. And I think that that's absolutely one of the best things you can do with your kids, and you can do it in small ways too, right? You can choose to play this video game or you can choose to study for your task. A week from now when you get that test back, how do you think you're going to feel about those two choices? Right?\n\n(00:17:43):\nSo that was a tool that I used a ton and it's just generally an amazing decision-making tool, just generally for people. It's one that I happen to use with my kids all the time. And then I would say that the other one was using the word nevertheless, which is this is a great leadership skill, the word nevertheless. So let's say my child got caught doing something wrong. I don't know, I found a bag of red solo cups in my backyard that they forgot to throw out after a weekend that I was away. That's hypothetical. So I'm grounding them and it's a lot of argument back, right? So they think this is a debate and they're giving me all of their input and their opinions on why it's unfair and all the other kids do it and the other parents don't get mad and whatever, whatever the argument is. You have to have the balance between them feeling heard, which I think is incredibly important that your children feel heard, and following through on what you know or believe is right.\n\n(00:18:56):\nSo it's I hear you. Nevertheless, you're grounded for two weeks. I hear what you're saying and I understand. Nevertheless, this is what's going to happen. And obviously, the words that you can use for that might be different. You have so much more authority obviously over your children than you do in other places. But in the workplace, this is very good because employees gripe all the time at decisions that you make in leadership because they think they're right and they want their way. And to have the ability to say, I heard you and your input, trust me, was incorporated into the decision, nevertheless, this is the path we're going to take. Right or wrong, that's what we're going to do. So I think there's a lot of things that basically you can say. These are good things to do with kids, but they're actually just generally really good decision strategies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:47):\nI'm taking notes on all these things. These are going to be extremely useful.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:19:51):\nNevertheless is a really good one with children.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:53):\nIt connects to something Dr. Becky teaches, if you know her, of telling someone, \"I believe you.\" When your kid says something and they're upset about something, start with I believe",

These are going to be extremely useful.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:19:51):\nNevertheless is a really good one with children.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:53):\nIt connects to something Dr. Becky teaches, if you know her, of telling someone, \"I believe you.\" When your kid says something and they're upset about something, start with I believe you.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:20:03):\nNevertheless.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:03):\nAnd here's nevertheless, exactly. Fair enough. I think we're going to start having to pivot this podcast to a parenting podcast because there's so much stuff here, but I'm going to try to resist. So we've been talking about decision-making and frameworks and things like that. Something I wanted to ask you is how much better can someone get at making better decisions? So for example, say someone listens to all of your podcasts, reads your book, studies it intensely. What's the delta you find in somebody being able to make a better decision? And where [inaudible 00:20:35] comes from is Daniel Kahneman of all people. People ask him, \"Do you just live such a optimal life now that you know all of these biases we have and all these mental errors we make?\" And he's like, \"No, I can't...\" I think he said famously, \"I don't, actually. I can't use these in practice. This is just stuff that I have learned, but it doesn't actually impact my day to day.\" So I'm curious just how much better can someone get? What kind of delta have you found in terms of making decisions?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:20:59):\nOkay, so it depends on whether you actually do the things. I mean, I think that that's what the issue is. I think Kahneman did some work way back that started him on this journey. That was basically work on hiring and it was taking it from completely unstructured Lenny, saying, \"I just know a great product manager when I see one\", whatever that means, to me going to Lenny and saying, \"Okay, I understand that you think that you see a great product manager you know one when you see one\", but can you explain to me what that means? In the abstract, what are the things that you're looking for in someone that you want to fill that role? And we can then excavate that, right? And make what is implicit because you're applying some implicit model to how you're thinking about the person that you're interviewing and how they map onto the role that they're going to be, but let's make that explicit.\n\n(00:22:04):\nSo we can make that explicit, we can turn it into a decision rubric, we can create a structured interview process out of that. And then what he found was after you've gone through that process, if you then use your intuition after having done that, not before, that then you actually can really drastically improve your hit rate on hiring. And in that case, it was from about a 50% hit rate to 65. So that's pretty huge, so that's a really big difference. The problem is nobody does it. So I can tell you that most of the conversations that I had with Danny that were about my work in particular were just him saying, \"How do you get anybody to do it?\" Now that's not to say that I would be better at that than him, it's that he didn't do my job, right? So he was an academic doing research and so on and so forth, I'm living in companies embedding for years.\n\n(00:23:02):\nI've been with one client for five years, one client for four years, one client for four years also, almost four years, three and a half years. And then I just took on a new client who I've been with for six months, and that's my whole client roster because I stay with them so long. So if you do it, the answer is quite a bit. Like at least in terms of Danny's work in relation to something pretty noisy like hiring, you went from 50% hit rate to 65% hit rate, which is huge. It's enormous. The problem is that the way that you can make decisions in order to be better at them is not supernatural to the way that humans make decisions.\n\n(00:23:47):\nI think we think a lot more highly of our intuition than we really ought to. We think very highly of our ability to notice things in the moment and act rationally toward them in a way that really we ought not to. We tend to think that we have insight that other people don't have when actually the other people probably have more insight into our situation than we do. So I think the answer is a lot with a big if, with an if you can get people to do it. And I think that's where the issue comes in. Now, the good news is that you can then reverse that and say if I'm willing to do it, think about what an edge I'm going to have over people who aren't willing to do it, right?\n\n(00:24:36):\nSo we can think there's people who don't know about it, there's people who do know about it but don't do it, and then there's people who do know about it, but do do it. And it's that last group that's so tiny. So the answer is I think a lot, but nobody does it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:54):\nSo maybe following that thread, when you look at companies that you've worked with or companies that have read your book and really dove in and started to implement some of your piece of advice to make better decisions, if you could look back at the",

So the answer is I think a lot, but nobody does it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:54):\nSo maybe following that thread, when you look at companies that you've worked with or companies that have read your book and really dove in and started to implement some of your piece of advice to make better decisions, if you could look back at the ones that had an impact, what do you find are the mental models or frameworks or tactics that really stick that most often have an impact and the biggest impact?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:25:18):\nI think the one that's easiest to implement is this. And it's so easy, and I just wish more people would do it. The best way to get somebody's opinion is independently of other people's opinions, independently asynchronously. So the way that I put is I want people to stop talking to each other so much. When we think about what did people generally think the purpose of a meeting is, they think it's for three things. Discovery, which is I want to discover what your opinions are, what your judgments are of something, right? So I want to find out what you think about something. So for example, if we're in product development and we're trying to figure out a timeline, we're trying to develop a product roadmap and we're trying to figure out how long it's going to take to release certain features or something like that, we all come into a room and we start yelling it out together.\n\n(00:26:29):\nIt's so bad for decision-making, I can't even tell you. There's cross influence, the loudest person in the room tends to then have an outsized influence on the decision, the most confident person in the room tends to have an outsized influence on the decision. And that's great if the most confident person is also right, but the problem is that's not always so. And so that's the discovery piece, right? And we tend to do that in a group. And then there's discussion, which is I've now discovered the way that Lenny is modeling this problem or what his judgments are about certain things or his forecasts are, his estimates are. And now, we're going to discuss those ideas and we're going to discuss your ideas in comparison to my ideas, and that's going to happen in the group setting. And then there's also now, we're going to decide in the group setting. So we're going to make some set of decisions about say what the roadmap is going to look like.\n\n(00:27:26):\nHere's the thing that I think is the easiest to change, is to realize the only thing that's ever supposed to happen in a meeting is the discussion part. So we should absolutely be coming together as human beings to discuss everybody's judgments and opinions and the way they're modeling the problem and their forecasts. In particular, it's really good to come in and discuss the places where people are different. So you've been in many meetings, I'm sure about 80% of the time is double clicking. Oh, I agree. And I want to now we've literally just used different words to say the exact same thing because I'm in agreement.\n\n(00:28:07):\nIf we can focus the discussion on places that people disagree, we're much better off. But so now we can take this, discover, discuss, decide. So I'm saying discuss is only supposed to happen in the meeting, that's the only thing that's supposed to happen in the meeting. So what's happening with the other stuff, the discover and the decide? Well, and this is the thing that I think I actually have been able to get people to do is discover what people think before you get in a room independently of each other. So how would you do that? Well, let's imagine that you're going to have a meeting about the product roadmap.\n\n(00:28:43):\nSo you would say to yourself in this meeting, what are the opinions that I need to get from the people in the room? It could be a brainstorm. What are all the different features that we could develop? So it could be a brainstorm. Fine. Write to them independently and say, \"Hey, free for off. Just come up with all the different features that you think would be reasonable for us to consider developing and then give me a forced rank from best to worst of your own ideas with some three to five sentence rationale as to why you have these things in this order.\" And so I could do that, but maybe we already have a list. I can send that out for a forced rank to everybody. Okay, so here's the final list of things we're really considering. Prioritize those for me, just force rank them. And then again, give me a rationale.\n\n(00:29:32):\nGive me a little bit of free writing as to why you think this should be, that you have these things in this order. Maybe we've decided now on what our top five priorities are. Great. I could, before the meeting, send the top five priorities out. \"Hey, we've decided on this stuff.\" For each thing, I'd like to understand what you think a reasonable timeline is, how many sprints it's going to take, so on, so forth, right? So we can ask for that type of information so that we can start making estimates because that's going to affect budget and what we're going back to the board with and so on so forth. But regardless, just figure out what is the thing that we're going to be discussing in this meeting? And I'm going to send it out to everybody independently and I'm going to say, \"Don't reply all, just send it back to me independently.\"\n\n(00:30:14):\nIf it's a repeated decision, you can actually create a rubric that lives on Airtable or Coda or Google Sheets or whatever,",

And I'm going to send it out to everybody independently and I'm going to say, \"Don't reply all, just send it back to me independently.\"\n\n(00:30:14):\nIf it's a repeated decision, you can actually create a rubric that lives on Airtable or Coda or Google Sheets or whatever, I don't really care. And people can input their decisions there where they can't see anybody else's decision. So with Google, you can use Google Forms in order to do it, and then it dumps into a spreadsheet that only you can see. That's a great way to do it. So anyway, so you do that and now you can now see everybody's opinions that you then now send out to the group and say, \"Everybody, look this over before we come in and discuss.\" So notice you're still working as a group, but you're working as a group where you're not in the same room together and talking at the same time. And there's a word for that, which is nominal group. So it's a group that at that moment is working independently and asynchronously of each other.\n\n(00:31:03):\nSo if you can get people to do that, and I do have companies where I don't consult with them, but I've just come in and talked to them briefly or whatever that do actually implement that piece of it. That is a huge piece of it, that's ginormous. And then you do the same thing for deciding. So the decision should not be made in a room, it's made either. I love the one decision maker model, but not everybody's down with that. But you can have a vote forum where people go vote in private about the way they're leaning.\n\n(00:31:39):\nYou can do a variety of things with that, but just don't do it. Don't do it in the meeting. And then just the last thing that I'll add, which is a muscle that you really have to exercise, is I think it's really important to understand that the word alignment in terms of we're all aligned as a group, right? The word alignment is stupid and it shouldn't be used. And I know I'm saying that very harshly, but it's true. It's dumb because it doesn't exist. You have 10 people in a room and they're all really different people with different opinions, and they're never going to come out of the room agreeing with each other. And it's really bad if the expectation is that they're supposed to, and it's really bad for a few reasons. One is it isn't reality, and that I don't like coming out of things without reality actually kicking.\n\n(00:32:38):\nSo it's not reality. People don't actually agree, they're not actually aligned on the decision. That's just the thing that makes you feel better, right? So I think that that's problem number one. But problem number two is that if the goal is alignment, if the goal is agreement, then the meeting becomes coercive and you never want that. So the way that I'm supposed to talk about my ideas is to convey why I believe what I do, not to convince anybody that I'm right because if I'm working to convince people that I'm right, it becomes coercive and that's horrible. So you have to get comfortable with walking out of the room. This is the nevertheless. Walking out of the room understanding that once you have that discussion, it's not that Lenny, your opinion might change. It could, right? I could say my thing and it could be just so damn brilliant that you change your mind somewhat, right?\n\n(00:33:37):\nSo you come maybe you're like, \"Oh, I'm thinking about this differently and actually\", but maybe you don't and you still believe a thing that's very different than me. And leadership has to say, \"That's fine. I've heard both of you and I know that this isn't going Annie's way. Nevertheless, trying to think about what all of our goals are, this is what the decision is going to be and it's totally fine that you ended up not agreeing with each other because it's reality. And what it allows me to do is get a better sense of what the space of decisions is.\" So those things I have been able to get people to do and they're actually quite impactful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:17):\nImagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10X increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision-makers, including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated two to five X higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms.\n\n(00:35:14):\nAudiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply",

There's an implication here you touched on a bit that there's a DRI essentially, there's one decision maker. Sometimes people start to feel like, \"Oh, my voice isn't heard. I don't have a lot of say, I can't be part of this decision.\" And you talked a bunch about just how to make people feel included, you get feedback along the way. But any advice there if you try to move to this model of making people feel like, \"Okay, I actually have impact on where this goes\"?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:35:58):\nYeah. So here's the really wonderful thing about moving from a coercive model to really, I guess you could say a model of curiosity, right? You want to be curious, not coercive, which means that the way that people in the meeting are talking about what their opinions are is in the mode of conveying information, not trying to convince anybody. So once we move away from that coercive model, and when I say coercive, I'm not saying anybody is purposely trying to set up a culture of coercion. Sometimes that's true, but for the most part, everybody's trying to do a good job and nobody's trying to set up a culture of coercion. But as soon as you say, \"Are we all in agreement? Are we all in alignment?\" And as soon as you're allowing people, and I'm sure you've been in these meetings, right? If you allow people to interrupt, if you allow people to say this, \"I think you're wrong\", \"I disagree\", \"Here's why\", those are all very coercive things to have happen.\n\n(00:37:12):\nInterrupting someone is silencing them. Saying, \"You're wrong\", well now, you become tribal and people aren't going to be open-minded and they're going to stake their ground and it's all really bad. So let's move away from that. Number one, that's already going to help. But when we think about the way that meetings normally happen, again, there's all this crosstalk and some people aren't speaking and some people are and so on, so forth. And then of course, not everybody feels equally heard. But when you work as a nominal group, let's talk about something as simple as we're going to make a forecast of how long it's going to take to launch this product feature. Okay. So I'm going to send out to everybody, what's your point estimate? What's your lower bound? What's your upper bound in terms of timeline?\n\n(00:38:02):\nAnd you could do it in some way, like how many sprints do you think is going to take whatever language you want to use? Now, everybody independently now gives their forecast with a rationale for why they believe that. And then you come into the room and you run a discussion where everybody's getting to say what their estimate was and why they believe that, and people are getting to ask questions. \"I have a question\" always is a clarification, it's just I don't understand. And as the leadership, the way that you would do it is, let me give you an example from a real one because that'll be easy. I did one of these discussions for a question about remote work, like what did the company want in terms of remote versus hybrid and that kind of thing. And so there was a lot of disagreement about whether whatever the policy was, it should be consistent across functions. Lots of disagreement.\n\n(00:39:01):\nSo let's take somebody who was on the, no, it shouldn't be consistent across functions. So they now say why they believe it shouldn't be consistent across functions and they say things like, \"Well, different functions have different requirements, right?\" So there's some functions that have to be in the office, like if you're IT as an example, but there's other functions which are more collaborative and creative and whatnot where it makes sense for people to be in the office, whereas engineers doesn't really matter, right? So there's different needs of different functions in terms of how much they need to be in the same space. So I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with this, I'm just saying what somebody said. So now as a facilitator, I never say, \"Oh, I agree.\" What I say is I just want to make sure I understood what you said and I reflect it back.\n\n(00:39:57):\nSo I say, \"So what I heard you say is that not all functions are created equal in terms of how well they work remotely or how well they work in person or what the flexibility might be. So what you're saying is there're functions that have to be in person. Period. And then other functions where that collaborative element being in the same office would be more important versus some functions where being remote is totally fine. Is that what you meant?\" And then they have the ability to say, \"Yes, that is what I meant\" or, \"Actually, I meant something slightly different. Let me say what that is\", and then I reflect that back. Okay, so literally you're just going around, you're calling on people to do that, and then you're reflecting back what they say without offering your own opinion. I don't know, Lenny. Tell me how someone doesn't feel heard in that situation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:48):\nYeah. Absolutely. I would feel so good if somebody just clarified and made it clear",

I would feel so good if somebody just clarified and made it clear they know exactly what I'm saying, even if the decision doesn't end up the way I want.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:40:57):\nRight, so that's the thing. And then what actually ends up happening is that the people in the room feel more, the psychological term would be endowed, more endowed to the decision. In other words, they feel like they have ownership over the decision. And whatever the decision is, they generally will see their selves reflected in it because they were heard. And they also will generally understand that nobody, no one really ends up with exactly every single thing that they wanted to see in the decision because they also get to see the true spread of opinions on the team. And what you see in that situation is that there's lots and lots and lots and lots of disagreement, which you don't see if you talk in a group. It narrows the space, right?\n\n(00:41:48):\nSo for example, particularly if you're senior, if you say, \"I think this is going to take three months to launch\" and I was thinking four weeks, you're never going to hear four weeks from me, ever. But if we get those opinions independently, you will actually hear that I think it's going to take four weeks. You may tend to be more right there being more senior, but I may have something interesting to say. You should hear what I have to say. And this also allows me to learn from you, too. But because I haven't heard your opinion first, then I'm not going to conform my opinion to yours. So it actually spreads the surface area of disagreement that you see on the team, which then makes people feel much better about the decision not being exactly what they want because they recognize like, \"Oh, this is actually a hard problem. People really disagree on this stuff.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:41):\nAmazing. I think this is going to be really helpful to a lot of people. Just to close the thread on this little summary maybe is core advice here is brainstorm separately. So I guess first, there's discover, discuss, decide. To discover ideas completely independently, basically brainstorms. You're a big advocate of brainstorming independently, sitting on your own, thinking through ideas. And then bringing people together to discuss all the things they've come up with and especially where they disagree. And then ideally having one person that makes a decision once she or he has taken all the input.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:43:12):\nYeah, you can have one person. I mean, I work with people where it's like a partnership and there's six people who are going to vote, but they still do it independently. They go to a forum. So I don't know what your vote is. And all six people don't have to agree. I mean, I just think it's really important that once you get above an end of one, you shouldn't necessarily expect the people to agree, which I think is just really important. And this is good for more than just brainstorming. It's for forecasting, any kind of project planning, budgeting. Yeah, I mean, we do this, for example, at First Round, we have a structured forum for evaluating a company in terms of whether you should invest in it because there are facts and then there are the way that you model those facts in. So it's a lot, what are the investor's opinion of the founder and the product and that kind of thing.\n\n(00:44:06):\nAnd we just have structure around how we're eliciting those opinions, which is really helpful. The other thing that I'll just add to what you said is that you can actually be in the same room together and still discover information independently. So this will happen on the fly all the time where people are talking and they start talking. Something comes up, like someone suggests some new feature or something like that, and then people start saying, \"Yeah, but that's going to take...\" And you go, \"Stop. Okay, everybody take out a piece of paper.\" So you can still get that same independence on the fly as well as doing it in advance. But yes, that was a very nice summary.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:49):\nIf this is just the one thing people take away from this conversation already, I think that could have a big impact. Speaking of First Round, one, we actually just had Todd Jackson on the podcast talking about-\n\nAnnie Duke (00:44:59):\nLove Todd.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:59):\n... love Todd, talking about product market fit. That episode will have come out before this episode. Also, so I asked Brett Berson, your colleague at First Round, what to ask you.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:45:00):\nOh, okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:08):\nYeah, yeah. By the way, your title of First Round is amazing, special partner. I've never seen that before.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:45:15):\nI am. It's a title just for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:17):\nOh, my God.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:45:17):\nI adore Brett Berson.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:19):\nMe, too.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:",

So you said that you have a very interesting framework for how to think about decision quality in the short term when the outcome is very long term. For example, investing. Also, many decisions we make in business, things you need to decide now that you only find out years from now. Can you talk about your advice there and your insights here?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:45:43):\nOh my gosh, I'm so happy that that's the question that he asked.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:45):\nYep, I see.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:45:47):\nOkay, so can I give a tiny bit of background to this?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:49):\nAbsolutely.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:45:50):\nSo prior to talking to First Round, I have another client too who, they're amazing, Renegade Partners at Roseanne Wincek and Renata Quintini. They're incredible. Before finally hooking up with them, and they work at different stages, First Round is C, obviously. Renegade is more like A B, tiny bit of dabble in C. But before running into them, I talked to quite a few venture firms who are interested in talking to me post-Thinking in Bets having come out, so this would be 2018. And there was a theme, there was a theme across them all. The first one was, well, the kind of decision-making you're talking about we don't need to do because we just know a good founder when we see one. So that is a sentence that came out of many people's mouths. And as I just said to you, okay, I have no doubt, but don't you want [inaudible 00:46:52] make that explicit?\n\n(00:46:53):\nThere's all sorts of great things that come from making it explicit, not just in terms of the increase in decision quality in the moment, but it actually allows you to close feedback loops much better. So that was one thing that I found quite surprising. But the one that I really found very interesting was being told, \"Well, what you're talking about doesn't apply because our feedback loops are a decade.\" And in poker, you got an answer right away. You won or lost the hand right away. So the way that you're thinking about decision-making doesn't really apply, until I met First Round and then Renegade where they actually heard what I had to say because I gave the same answer to everybody. So we'll just put aside that wouldn't you want to make that explicit. The first thing that I would say is, oh, poker is much noisier than you think because when I win a hand, I have no idea why.\n\n(00:47:50):\nSo I do actually have to wait a long time because I have to play many, many, many hands before I actually know, do I actually have an edge? Because I actually don't know very much. On one hand, for one thing, I almost never see my opponent's card, so I'm left in a dust of uncertainty. But separately from that, the main thing that I said was, how could you possibly think that the feedback loop is 10 years? And this is what I think really caught First Round's eye because when I was talking to Josh Kopelman about it, he said, \"Well, what do you mean? We don't get an exit for 10 years.\" And I said, \"Oh, I'm sorry, do you invest? And then you go to sleep like Rip Van Winkle? And then you wake up 10 years later and you go, 'Hey, how'd that go?' Or are there all sorts of things that happen in between?\" The simplest thing, the simplest thing is does it fund at Series A?\n\n(00:48:46):\nAnd the little pushback that I would get there is, but we're not investing for Series A. And I say, \"Well, I know that\", but have you ever had a company that exited for more than a billion dollars that did not fund at Series A? And the answer is no. And I'm like, okay. So it sounds like that's necessary. Might not be sufficient, but it's necessary. And it's certainly a signal that is actually more highly correlated with exiting out well than the investment at C. And then, oh, right, you have series B. And that's separate from all the other things that you can look at, like what you talked to Todd Jackson about. Is it achieving product market fit? We know that eventually for it to be successful, it's going to have to achieve product market fit, right? So you can look at what's happening with that, just general things about traction, what's happening with net new ARR, ability to retain top talent churn.\n\n(00:49:55):\nI mean, there's so many different things that you can look at, all of which are things that you know must happen in order for the big thing to happen. Okay, so what that means is that this is the big, I'm going to make a bold statement here. There is no such thing as",

Okay, so what that means is that this is the big, I'm going to make a bold statement here. There is no such thing as a long feedback loop. You can make a decision about how long the feedback loop is. That is your choice to live in a long feedback loop, and you can choose to shorten the feedback loop. And the way you choose to shorten the feedback loop is to say, what are the things that are necessary but not sufficient? That's one thing, for getting a good exit, or what are the things that are correlated with the outcome that I eventually desire? And what that means is that when you're at the decision point, right? Like in First Round's case, I'm going to invest in a company.\n\n(00:50:51):\nWhat you have to understand is that you are making a prediction about how the world is going to unfold, how the future is going to unfold. And those things that you're predicting. You can track, and you can track them back to the decision and you can do it pretty darn fast, mind you. I mean, think about being in 2021. There were companies that were raising in A six months after seed. Today, it's a little more 16 months-ish. But even so, let's just say that that was the only thing that you decided to do. I'm going to forecast the probability that this company's going to fund at Series A. And then obviously, those companies start to fund or not fund at Series A and you're finding that out in 16 months. Here's my question for you, Lenny. Is 16 months shorter than 10 years?\n\n(00:51:38):\nSo it's probably why he said to ask me that question because I just really do. I mean, I have a very strong opinion about this. The feedback loop is as long as you choose it to be. And if I take that back to some of the things that I heard early on when I was talking to people, what I would say is that I think that there is a certain amount of psychological safety in allowing the feedback loop to stay long because really of two main factors. One is that, look, if I was early into Uber and now I'm a celebrity investor or something, I don't really want to know if I'm good or not. Do I? Right? I don't really want the world to know that. I mean, if I'm good, that's great. But it feels like they already believe that I'm good because I happen to be early into Uber.\n\n(00:52:47):\nSo since people already think I'm good, I'm just losing to that decision, psychologically speaking. Not investment quality speaking, but psychologically speaking. Okay, so here's the problem though. Why was I early into Uber? Did I have an insight into a real pain point in a developing market, blah, blah, blah? Or did my buddy start Uber and I was like, \"Sure, I'll give you some money?\" Right? I mean, obviously, I'm talking about the extremes here, but we don't actually know what the decision quality was, right? All we know is that you had a good result and given that you had a good result and people think very highly of you, what are you going to gain? Right? So it's so nice to just let that feedback loop sit there and allow people to have the opinion of you. That is really nice, feels good, right? And not actually find out the answer because why would I want to?\n\n(00:53:51):\nUnless you're really super focused on decision quality, then you would want to do that. So that's part of the psychological safety. And what that goes to is, the real core of it is that it's very, very difficult for human beings to deal with feeling wrong in the moment, even if it helps them in the long run. It's just hard. And the tighter the feedback loop, the more that you risk finding out you are wrong in the short run. Now that helps you to learn and improve your decision-making if you're focused on it and you're good at it, right? That's going to help you. And then in the long run, you're actually going to do better. But human beings are notoriously good at trading off the long run just to feel good in the short run. That's why we're all eating chocolate and cupcakes and stuff that we know is bad for us because it feels good.\n\n(00:54:45):\nAnd so much of our decision-making is trying to advance this positive self-narrative and the idea that yeah, we're going to have a more positive narrative ourselves in five years if we do some stuff. Most of us are like, \"No, I don't really want to make that trade. I'd rather just feel good now\", and I can use the fact that we are living in power law, under the influence of power law. I can use that to just confirm a lot of things that I wish to believe that are true of me. And if you take that away from me and you take the uncertainty away from me, it's going to be really hard. And I will tell you that's what I love about both Renegade and First Round is that they're just like, I want to know. It would be such a horror for me to think that I was making good decisions when I actually wasn't. And that's what really matters to me and I think that it's just so special.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:47):\nHearing all this makes me want to be an LP in First Round",

Not that they would let me in there, but just knowing that you're in there futzing with everything and the way they're thinking is really inspiring. I'm curious if you could share an example of anything that they tweaked as a result of this analysis that you did and how they evaluate.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:56:05):\nWell, first of all, let me just say they didn't really record a lot about their decisions when I first came in. They voted and they had a record of the vote so they knew who said yes and who said no, but they didn't have a lot of other information. So the first thing that happened was just that. Okay, what do we really think is the way that you would model whether you should invest or not invest in? Very broadly, you would say you're reading the market, the team, the founder, the product broadly. We're going to make sure that those opinions aren't just like it's good or it's bad, but it's on a scale of one to seven so that we can actually get some precision and some spread among the partners in terms of, say, strength of market. We're going to make sure that we have shared definitions of those things, which you'd be surprised people don't.\n\n(00:57:00):\nSo when I am thinking about market and market quality, I might be thinking about something very different than you. So we want to make sure that we have a shared definition of that, and that's reflected in something that we would call mediating judgments, which are judgments that you make related to market prior to actually judging what you think of the market in general. So you could think of something like competitive landscape, so you would judge that. So that turns into what these mediating judgments are, which is basically an implied definition.\n\n(00:57:30):\nSo you create that, and then you also think about what are the forecasts that are important. One thing that you already know is you're going to forecast the probability the company funds at Series A. So that was a huge change, just a very different way of making decisions. What we've been able to do with that now because I've been there for five years is we now can actually look, say the partnership as a whole, and look at these ratings that they're making of the component pieces of parts of how they're modeling, like what makes a good investment, these forecasts that they're making.\n\n(00:58:03):\nAnd we actually know how these companies have now unfolded. So in the simplest sense, we know whether hundreds of companies have funded at Series A or not. And now, we can actually look and say, how good are the partners at actually forecasting this thing? Right? Are they random? Are they better than random? And we actually know that and we can feed that back to them so that they can understand their own accuracy around these pieces of the decision because the fact is that whatever a seed investor says to you, whether that company is going to fund at Series A is part of their decision. It's included in the decision. So they're making that forecast whether they make the forecast explicitly or not. So what we're saying over at First Round is let's make it explicit because you're doing it implicitly anyway, and then we can actually start to look at your accuracy.\n\n(00:58:58):\nWe can now feed that back to you and let you know how accurate you are, which will then help you to become more accurate, right? We can also look, because we know in any given vintage what are the best companies or what are the worst companies. Remember, we're having people do these ratings on a scale of one to seven of say the quality of the market, and we can look across the partnership and say, \"Look, Lenny, when you think the market is great, how does that map onto how well the company is doing in the future? When you say the market is terrible, how well does that map onto how that company is doing, how that company ends up doing in the future?\" And I can come to you and I can say, \"Oh, Lenny, by the way, your judgments about market are amazing.\"\n\n(00:59:47):\nYou know a good market when you see one and it's really mapping on in a great way onto how that company unfolds, but you're not so great with founder, or maybe you're great across the board, or maybe you're not. So we can now start to give people, we can give the partners insight into their own decision-making, not only to allow them to improve the decision-making, but also to allow them to understand not to over index on certain things that maybe aren't as predictive as an example for them. We also can change the rubric based on the evidence now.\n\n(01:00:22):\nSo the first version of the rubric is always taking the intuitions of the partners and making those explicit, but then we can start to loop those back together and understand, well, maybe this thing that the partners thought was important actually isn't predictive across any partner. For example, we can start to develop the rubric based on the data. These were all things that weren't possible because prior to that, if I had come in and said, \"Well, let's look at decision quality\", how would I do that? I mean, I have no idea why people were... I just know whether they said yes or no. And so it's very",

And so it's very difficult to them to start to do some really serious refining of the decisions if I don't have that information.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:08):\nI desperately want to know which partner it makes the best decisions. I know you're not going to share them.\n\nAnnie Duke (01:01:13):\nNo, I'm not going to. The partnership as a whole is excellent as we know. And this is what I will tell you is that all partners have strengths and all partners have weaknesses, and they're not perfectly overlapping, which is wonderful, right? I mean, that's one of the things. It's like what's really wonderful, and I think it shows the power of why would you have more than one person having input into a decision, is some people are very strong on rating a particular aspect of market, or some people are very strong on rating a particular aspect of the founder. There's overlap and then there's things where Todd is uniquely great at something, or Josh is uniquely great at something, or Bill is uniquely great at something. So that's a wonderful thing about it is that everybody has strengths and everybody has weaknesses and they're not perfectly overlapping. So this is where you can see getting that spread of opinions and really understanding, breaking that decision down into its component parts really shows you the value of diverse opinions as input into a decision.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:21):\nI could talk about this thread forever. Maybe let me just ask one more question just because I'm super curious. Is there anything surprising that stands out, that came out of this analysis so far? Just like, oh wow, maybe market isn't as important as we thought or this person is amazing at-\n\nAnnie Duke (01:02:34):\nYes. So I think just generally speaking, when you're creating the initial decision rubric, there are things that people are really pounding the table about that they think is especially important in making a decision. And one of the things that we found is that sometimes their intuition was absolutely right. The thing that they were pounding the table about is incredibly predictive, not just for them but other partners. But sometimes it's not at all predictive, and these are equal table-pounding situations. So let's say you're pounding the table about something, sometimes the thing you're pounding at the table about is predictive for you and for all the other partners that it's actually quite predictive about how the company does. But sometimes when you're really pounding the table about something, it's not just that it's not predictive for the other partners, it's not predictive for you.\n\n(01:03:33):\nAnd I think that what's really important to understand about this, and this is why it's so incredibly necessary in improving decision quality to take what's implicit and make it explicit, is that our intuition is sometimes right and sometimes wrong. It's not that intuition is crap and your intuition is just completely wrong, I mean obviously, that can't be true. We would die, right? So your intuition is sometimes right, but it's also sometimes wrong. And if you don't make it explicit, then you don't get to find out when it's wrong.\n\n(01:04:07):\nYou don't get to find out when it's off base, and that's a disaster. So that's the thing that I think is really interesting is that you have equal vehement and confidence that this particular factor is really important. And sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. And it's so surprising because we're talking about people who are true experts who are great, and I think that we all just have intuition about intuition, right? You just intuit that if they're so amazing, clearly their intuition about what's important would have to be good, but not necessarily. That's the thing, not necessarily. Yeah, I think that was probably the most exciting thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:56):\nKeeping it mysterious, but I still appreciate you sharing.\n\nAnnie Duke (01:04:59):\nWell, I have to keep it mysterious.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:02):\nYes, I understand.\n\nAnnie Duke (01:05:03):\nI can't give away the trade secrets.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:06):\nI wanted to touch on a different framework that I've heard a lot of companies actually using, and something that comes up in product a lot is this idea of pre-mortems, which is essentially think ahead of time what might go wrong. Can you talk about this? Because I think that it's something that's easy to implement, really powerful, and a lot of people are actually doing this.\n\nAnnie Duke (01:05:25):\nYes, okay. So a pre-mortem is great, but only if you attach a pre-commitment with it. So I just want to be super clear about that. What you find with pre-mortems, this actually work. I actually did this work with Maurice Schweitzer and Linnea Gandhi, who are both at Penn. Then when you have people do pre-mortems, it generally doesn't actually change their plan very much or it changed their behavior. So I think that we have the feeling that if you do a pre-mortem and you think what are the ways that things might go wrong, that that's going to change your plan, but probably not unless you're specifically using it for that purpose and you say, \"Okay, we're going to do",

I'm sure that everybody has felt that way before. Things go on way too long, even like they're over budget and you've blown the timeline. And when you finally shut it down, you realize you should have done it a lot earlier. And this is true across the board because of a variety of biases. The most well-known, and probably the biggest influence is something called sunk cost, which is that feeling, but then I'll have wasted all the time and effort that I've put into this already. So it's taking into account what you've put in in the past and deciding whether to continue on in the future. So what we want to do is actually just get better at that thing. So understanding that when you've gotten to the pre-mortem process, you probably are going to launch it, like it's probably going to be the case.\n\n(01:07:22):\nUse the pre-mortem to set up kill criteria. So I'll give you an example from a sales team that I worked with. Basically, I sent them out a prompt, all the IC is a prompt that was, imagine that you got a lead through an RFP or RFI and you worked on it for six months. And now, it's six months later and the deal is dead. Looking back, you realized they were early signals that that was going to be the case, what were they. So this is a pre-mortem. What are the things that you saw that would tell you that this was going to go south? And they came up with all sorts of ideas. Notice this doesn't mean they're not going to start off pursuing the lead, right? But they saw, they came up with all sorts of signals. So I'll just give you three of them.\n\n(01:08:12):\nThe RFP RFI was clearly written with a competitor in mind, so they felt that was a very bad signal that was probably going to go badly. Another one was the customer didn't want to demo, they only wanted to talk about price. Obviously, that's quite bad. And another one was after the first few meetings, they couldn't get a decision maker in the room, right? So it was a much longer list than this, but those are three. So for each of those, that now becomes a kill criteria if I see this thing and now you attach an action with it. So in the case of price, they actually just said, \"We should kill it.\" If they literally don't want to demo and they're only asking about price, they're just trying to beat up somebody else on price like we're a box-checking exercise. So there, they just said, \"We're going to kill it. We're not going to pursue the deal anymore.\"\n\n(01:08:59):\nSo this is great because salespeople will pursue deals forever and leadership is like, \"Well, why did you stop pursuing that deal?\" And they get in trouble for it. So this is going to help with that problem, right? In the case of the RFP RFI was written with a competitor in mind, they have an action associated with that as well, which is ask them directly if they're working with a competitor and how far down the road they are, depending on the answer you would kill or pursue. In the case of we couldn't get a decision maker in the room, offer up executive alignment at the next meeting. And if they say sure, great. And if they say no, kill.\n\n(01:09:35):\nSo that's actually what I feel is the best use of a pre-mortem is to say, I'm going to try to figure out what those signals are along the way that things are going badly. And now instead of just hoping that when I see those signals, I actually act rationally, which is a hope that it will not come true. That's why there's many people who climb Everest in the middle of a blizzard, even though they shouldn't be doing that. Use the pre-mortem to now create structure around those signals that you've spotted and commit to actions that you're going to take if you see those signals. And I think that's the best use of a pre-mortem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:15):\nThat's really helpful. And it's interesting how many of your examples come back to just of a framework that you often talk about, which is make it explicit what is implicit. There's another example that the First Round example is a great example of that where it's just, here's all our assumptions, they just make them actually explicit and just shows how much [inaudible 01:10:32].\n\nAnnie Duke (01:10:32):\nRight, then you can examine them. You can examine them, people can discuss them, you can figure out if they're wrong or right or whatever. It's like, I want to be very clear, I'm not anti your gut or your intuition. I think it's probably sometimes pretty good. I just",

So we didn't have time to get into quitting, which is your more recent book. Maybe we'll do a follow-up episode specifically thinking about quitting, but let me just ask-\n\nAnnie Duke (01:11:03):\nIt's my fault because my answers are long.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:05):\nIt's my fault.\n\nAnnie Duke (01:11:06):\nI apologize to everybody.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):\nNo apology is necessary. We'll have plenty of time in the future, hopefully. Well, let me just ask one question. I found this one quote from you where you said you should assume that if you're thinking about quitting, it's already probably past the time that you should have quit. Do you still believe that? Is that generally a good rule of thumb? And just any takeaway, tip, lesson on quitting as our one question on quitting?\n\nAnnie Duke (01:11:29):\nSo the data is pretty strong that by the time you quit, it's probably long after the [inaudible 01:11:37]. And it's really just because, look, when we start things, we're starting things under difficult circumstances, which come from the uncertainty of the decision to start something. So when we start something, luck is going to have an influence on the outcome, which obviously, we have no control over because luck isn't in our control. And then there's also hidden information. So what happens is that after the fact, we know that we're going to learn new information and it can make it very hard to start things because we want to be more sure than we actually need to be. It's why Bezos has the 70% role to try to roll people back and be willing to accept that uncertainty in the starting decision. Now the good news is that when you learn that new stuff and the new stuff that you learn is, \"Ooh, if I had known this, I wouldn't have started it\", you have the option to quit generally.\n\n(01:12:28):\nSo that's the good news. The bad news is that the same difficulties that apply to the decision to start apply to the decision to stop. In other words, we're making that decision under uncertainty as well. So we're not going to know for sure whether it would've turned out well or poorly unless we continue to do the thing that we already started. And we don't like to walk away from things unless we know for sure. So as Richard Thaler put it, most people won't quit until it actually isn't a decision. In other words, the whole thing is blown up, the startup has no money, or you're up on Everest and the blizzard is literally upon you and you're stuck in it. Or I think as he said, until you've fallen in the crevasse already, then you'll make the decision to quit because then you know how it was really bad. So people generally, for example, don't quit their jobs until they feel they have no other choice or relationships or projects or products that they're developing, it all applies because we want to know for sure.\n\n(01:13:35):\nAnd then on top of that is the fact that there is this issue of sunk cost, which is when we walk away, we feel like we'll have wasted everything that we've already put into what we're doing. But of course, waste is a prospective problem, not a retrospective one, even if we treat it like a retrospective one because it's the prospective one. Well, if you wouldn't start this today, then that means that everything that you're putting into this going forward is the actual waste, right? But we do that all the time. We go forward with things that we ought not to be going forward with because we're trying to protect the resources that we've already sunk into it in the past. Then there's other issues that have to do with, for example, endowment, the ownership over the things that we've built. This is particularly bad in product because we're building things.\n\n(01:14:18):\nAnd once we build things, we own them. And once we own them, we don't want to give them up and we actually value them more highly than identical things that we don't own. And then there's issues of internal and external validity, which is really just a fancy way to say your identity. How do other people view you? How do you view yourself? Do you feel like you failed? And what that means is that by the time, there's so many biases against stopping that by the time you're actually even thinking about quitting, it's probably already past the time that you ought to have quit. But we'll still continue on until we know for sure we didn't have any choice because here's the thing. When you walk away from something and someone's like, \"Hey, why'd you stop that?\" And you're like, \"Oh, I had no choice\" and you tell them everything that went wrong and, nobody's going to question you.\n\n(01:15:04):\nThey're going to be like, \"Oh, well, it sounds like you put in your best effort.\" But if you walk away early, people are like, \"What?\" So just quickly, I'll tell you I think just one of the best stories of this that I've got in my pocket here.",

Let me pull it out before the end. So Stewart Butterfield creating a product called Glitch, and Glitch is a massive multiplayer online world-building cooperative game. Releases it, this is in the aughts, and it's like a huge hit with the critics. It's Monty Python meets Dr. Seuss, it's an incredible whatever. They're getting tons and tons of great word of mouth and PR not doing any paid marketing. They have incredible investors in Andreessen Horowitz and Accel, they have $6 million in the bank and they 5,000 have diehard users, meaning users who use the game who play over 20 hours a week.\n\n(01:16:04):\nThe issue is that customer acquisition was a beast that for every one person who was playing over 20 hours a week, there were between 95 and 99 people who came for five minutes and left. So obviously, this is a customer acquisition problem, which everybody knows. So they make an agreement in 2012 that they're going to do paid marketing, which they do for six weeks. And during that six weeks, their acquisition of new users, it's growing like six to 7% week over week, which is amazing. And at the end of that six weeks, this is November of 2012, at the end of that six weeks, that Monday morning, Stewart Butterfield writes a note to his investors and co-founders and says, \"I woke up this morning with the dead certainty that Glitch was over.\"\n\n(01:16:58):\nNow notice nobody would do this in this case, right? But this is what happened is that the issue is that you really have to see is this worthwhile or not? Would I start this today? That's a forecast of the future, right? And what he did was some back-of-the-envelope math, and he said, \"Look, if we continue to acquire customers at the weight that we've been acquiring them at the cost that we've been acquiring them, it's going to be 31 weeks until we break even.\" But that's an absurd assumption because customer acquisition costs, it's going to go up. Cap has to rise because we're going to saturate the core gaming market, so it's got to rise. So what he realized at that point was that this was not a venture scale business, and he was in this for a venture scale business. So even though nobody else saw that he was supposed to shut it down, he saw he was supposed to shut it down.\n\n(01:17:45):\nAnd not only that, he saw that he was supposed to shut it down for his employees who were working for equity, and he had now realized that the equity wasn't worth their time and that it wasn't fair to them to keep going with it. So he shuts it down. Obviously, that feels... Who does that? Right? And he will actually tell you that he knows he should have shut it down before the marketing push, but he needed the marketing push to prove it to himself that he was seeing the future clearly. Now, the code to this story just quickly is two days later, he's like, \"Well, I'm a startup guy. I want to start something\", and he's got this internal communication tool that his team is using in order to develop this product that everybody loves. And he says, \"Actually, they really like that. Maybe that should be the next product.\"\n\n(01:18:29):\nSo he goes and talks to the investors, they roll their money over into that. And that thing, which had no name at the time, now gets a name which is searchable log of all company knowledge, which is Slack. And so I think this is the important thing to realize is that we get so focused on, \"But what about everything that I've put into it?\" When what we forget is that when you're doing something, there's not just the cost of doing something that's not worthwhile that's direct, but there's also the cost of not being able to devote your attention to other opportunities that might be available to you. And as smart as Stewart Butterfield is, he couldn't see Slack until he quit Glitch. And that is a true cost that he would've born of continuing with Glitch. If he had continued with Glitch, Slack would not be something that we're all using today.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:21):\nThat is an incredibly beautiful way to end our conversation. I feel like I have at least a billion more questions to ask you and on the other hand, I feel like we've also helped a lot of people make much better decisions through this chat so I'm really thankful that you made time for this. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn about the stuff you're up to in case they want to work with you?
